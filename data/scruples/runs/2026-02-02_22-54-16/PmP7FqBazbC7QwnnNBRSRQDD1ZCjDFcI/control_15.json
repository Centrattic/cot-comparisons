The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who has a girlfriend, Amy, but he's planning a trip with his friend Melissa, who's in love with him. The trip was originally supposed to be with a group, but ended up being just him and Melissa because others didn't agree. Amy is uncomfortable with them sharing a room but was okay after being assured they're just friends. Then, Melissa confesses her feelings, tries to kiss him, and he leaves. Now, Amy thinks it's inappropriate to go on the trip with her, but the guy argues it's about the money and he can handle himself.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down. The key points here are the existing relationship with Amy, the trip with Melissa, and Melissa's confession. Even though the guy says he wouldn't cheat, the situation is potentially risky. His girlfriend feels it's inappropriate, which is a valid concern. Being alone with someone who is in love with you can create tension and pressure, even if you intend to stay faithful. The fact that Melissa tried to kiss him shows she's not holding back, and he might feel pressured to reciprocate or at least deal with her advances. \n\nFrom Amy's perspective, she's trusting him, but trust is one thing, and minimizing the risk of anything that could strain the relationship is another. The trip being a potential source of jealousy and conflict is a problem. Even if he's not cheating, the trip could lead to emotional issues or make Amy feel insecure. The non-refundable money is a concern, but it's not a valid reason to take the trip if it risks the relationship. Relationships require consideration and respect for the partner's feelings. So, the guy isn't necessarily cheating, but he's putting himself in a situation that could be harmful. Therefore, he's in the wrong by not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the potential risks, even if he has good intentions. The answer should be A.\n"
