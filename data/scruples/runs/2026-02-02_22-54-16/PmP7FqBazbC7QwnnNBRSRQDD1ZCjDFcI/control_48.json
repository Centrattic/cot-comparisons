The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a girlfriend, Amy, and a friend, Melissa, who is in love with him. They had planned a trip to Hawaii, which was supposed to be just the two of them because the other friends couldn't agree on dates. Now, Melissa made a move on him, and Amy is upset about the trip going ahead with them alone.\n\nFirst, the author is in a committed relationship, so infidelity is a big deal. Melissa is clearly interested in a romantic way, which complicates things. The author initially thought they were just friends, but now that Melissa's feelings are out in the open, it's a potential issue. \n\nThe author argues that the trip is about the money and that they've already paid for it. But Amy feels it's inappropriate to go on a trip alone with someone who has romantic feelings for him. Even if the author intends to be appropriate, the situation is risky. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and Amy is concerned that despite his intentions, being alone with Melissa in Hawaii could lead to problems. \n\nThe author says he wouldn't cheat, but the problem isn't just about cheating. It's about respecting his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. Even if he's innocent, the trip could make Amy feel insecure and might damage their trust. \n\nAlso, the author initially told Amy that Melissa and he were just friends, but now Melissa's confession has created a conflict. The author might not be considering how his actions, even if innocent, can affect Amy's perception and trust. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider the partner's feelings and avoid situations that could cause jealousy or mistrust. The author's insistence on going on the trip despite Amy's objections might be seen as not prioritizing her feelings enough. \n\nSo, even if the author isn't planning to do anything wrong, the situation is problematic because of Melissa's feelings and the potential for misunderstandings. The right thing would be to cancel the trip to respect Amy's feelings and avoid any appearance of impropriety. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
