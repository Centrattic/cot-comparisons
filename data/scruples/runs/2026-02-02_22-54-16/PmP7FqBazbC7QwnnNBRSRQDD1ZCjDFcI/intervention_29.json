The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for going on a trip with Melissa, his friend who's in love with him, while he's in a 9-month relationship with Amy.\n\nFirst, the setup: They planned a trip for a college friend group, but due to scheduling issues, it became just the author and Melissa. The author didn't invite his girlfriend, Amy, because Melissa thought it was bad to plan a trip with someone he'd just started dating. Amy was initially okay with them sharing a room as friends. Then, at a party, Melissa made it clear she's in love with the author and tried to kiss him. He told her he wasn't feeling well and left. Now, Amy is upset that the trip is still happening, even though the author says he won't let anything inappropriate happen. The author is worried about the money since some payments are non-refundable, and he's arguing that Amy should trust him. But Amy feels it's inappropriate regardless.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is in a committed relationship, and his girlfriend is uncomfortable with him going on a trip alone with a friend who has feelings for him. The friend is in love with him and made a move on him after a party. The author is trying to justify it as just the cost and his own integrity, but Amy doesn't feel trusted. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, even if he intends to be appropriate, the situation is inherently risky. Being alone on a trip with someone who is romantically interested in you can create pressure or opportunities for things to go wrong, even if you don't want them to. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid because she's in a trusting relationship and this could be seen as a breach of that trust, even if no actual infidelity occurs. The fact that Melissa made a move on him in the past shows there's a history of her pursuing him, which adds to the risk. The author's argument that it's just about the money is understandable, but it doesn't address the emotional impact on his girlfriend. Trust is mutual in a relationship, and if one partner is uncomfortable with a situation, the other should consider their feelings. So, even if the author doesn't act improperly, the decision to proceed with the trip might be seen as disregarding his girlfriend's feelings and the potential for misunderstanding. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not prioritizing her comfort and the integrity of their relationship.\n"
