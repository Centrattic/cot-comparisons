The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The guy is in a 9-month relationship with Amy, but he's planning a trip with his friend Melissa, who's been in love with him for three years. They organized the trip as a group, but it ended up being just them two because the others didn't agree. Melissa was in charge, and he didn't invite Amy because Melissa suggested it wasn't a good idea with someone he'd only been dating for a short time. Amy was initially uncomfortable with them sharing a room but was okay after he assured her they were just friends.\n\nNow, Melissa made a move, confessing her feelings and trying to kiss him. He told her he wasn't feeling well and left. He told Amy about it, and she thinks he should cancel the trip because it's inappropriate. He argues it's about the money since some payments are non-refundable. Amy is upset and feels like there's more to his decision than just money.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether going on a trip alone with someone who has confessed romantic feelings is appropriate, especially when the partner is uncomfortable. The author is in a committed relationship, and Melissa has made it clear she's in love with him and wants more than friendship. Even though the author claims he wouldn't cheat, the situation is risky. Being in a secluded environment (Hawaii trip) with someone who has feelings for you can create temptation and pressure, even if you're not interested. Amy's trust is important, but her comfort and the relationship's health are also key.\n\nThe author's argument is about the financial loss, but Amy is questioning his priorities. She might feel that he's choosing money over her feelings and the integrity of their relationship. Even if he intends to be appropriate, the perception and the potential for issues are there. Melissa's confession complicates things because it's a new dynamic that wasn't there before. The fact that Melissa was the one to push for the trip with just them two, and now she's made a move, makes it even more delicate.\n\nIn relationships, it's about communication and mutual respect. If Amy is uncomfortable, the appropriate response would be to honor her feelings and cancel the trip, even if it's costly. Prioritizing the relationship over financial loss is often the healthier choice. The author might believe he's being honest and clear with Amy, but his decision to proceed could undermine her trust, even if she says she trusts him. Trust is about actions too. By going on the trip, he's putting her in a position where she might doubt his commitment to the relationship's well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because continuing the trip despite his partner's discomfort and the potential for issues is not respecting her feelings enough. Even if his intentions are good, the situation is inherently problematic given Melissa's feelings and the circumstances.\n"
