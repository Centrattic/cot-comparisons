The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering going on a trip with Melissa when Melissa is in love with him, and he's in a 9-month relationship with Amy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author and Melissa planned the trip for the college friend group, but others didn't agree, so it's just the two of them. Amy was uncomfortable about sharing a room but okay after being assured they're just friends. Then, Melissa made a move, confessed her feelings, and tried to kiss him. He told her he wasn't feeling well and left. He told Amy, and she wants to cancel the trip, but he's arguing it's about the money and he's not going to cheat.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, Melissa is his friend, and she has feelings for him. He's in a relationship, so going on a trip alone with someone who is in love with him could be risky, even if he's faithful. Amy's concern is about trust and the potential for things to escalate, even if he intends to stay appropriate. The author's reasoning is that it's about the money and he can handle himself. But in relationships, sometimes the perception and the other person's feelings matter a lot. Even if he's not cheating, being alone in a romantic setting with someone who has feelings for him might be hurtful to his girlfriend. Plus, Melissa is in a vulnerable position here, having confessed her feelings and then being left in a situation where they're traveling alone together. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is standing by his word that he's not going to do anything wrong. He might feel that Amy should trust him. However, in relationships, sometimes certain situations are just not wise, regardless of intentions. The fact that Melissa tried to kiss him after expressing her feelings shows that she's emotionally invested, which could complicate things further. \n\nSo, even if the author doesn't act on it, the trip could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since it's a long trip with shared accommodations. Amy's trust is important, and if she's upset, maybe canceling is the right move. The author might not be intentionally wrong, but he's putting himself in a position that could strain his relationship. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the potential for misunderstanding, even if he has good intentions.\n"
