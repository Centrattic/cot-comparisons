The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is that the author is in a 9-month relationship with Amy, and they had planned a trip to Hawaii with their friend Melissa, who has been in love with the author for three years. The trip was supposed to be a group thing, but due to scheduling issues, it's just the two of them. The author didn't invite their girlfriend, Amy, because Melissa had a say against it. Then, after a party, Melissa confesses her feelings, tries to kiss the author, who leaves. The author tells Amy about this, and Amy is upset that they plan to go on the trip with Melissa despite the situation.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's wrong to go on the trip with Melissa now that her feelings are known. The author argues it's about the money and non-refundable payments, and that they trust each other. But Amy is uncomfortable and feels it's inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author is in a committed relationship, and going on a trip alone with a friend who is in love with him could be seen as a potential conflict of interest. Even if the author doesn't have romantic feelings for Melissa, the situation could be risky. Trust is important in relationships, and while the author believes they can handle it, Amy's discomfort is valid. \n\nMelissa's confession creates a new dynamic. The author didn't plan the trip with romantic intentions, but now that Melissa is openly expressing feelings, continuing the trip might be seen as putting their relationship with Amy at risk. The fact that they had to share a room initially was a red flag that Amy was already uncomfortable with. Even if the author is confident in their own actions, the potential for misunderstandings or situations that could make Amy feel insecure is high.\n\nFinancial considerations are a real issue, but relationships often require making sacrifices for the sake of trust and emotional health. The author might think they're being reasonable by prioritizing the money, but Amy's perspective is about emotional safety. The author's girlfriend might feel that the author isn't respecting her feelings enough by not canceling the trip. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author didn't inform Amy about Melissa's feelings earlier could be a problem. They waited until after the incident to tell her, which might contribute to her feeling that the trip should be canceled. The author's reasoning that they would never act inappropriately is their own belief, but Amy's trust is about more than just actions\u2014it's about perception and potential risks.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The author isn't necessarily cheating or intending to be disloyal, but the situation is ethically questionable. The wrong here might be more on Melissa for making a move after the author was in a relationship, but the question is about the author's actions. The author is choosing to proceed with the trip despite their partner's concerns, which could be seen as not prioritizing the relationship's health. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong by not canceling the trip to avoid unnecessary emotional strain on their relationship. Even if it's costly, relationships require compromise. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the author is confident in their ability to handle it and has Amy's trust, maybe it's not their fault. But given that Amy is clearly upset and the situation has the potential to cause issues, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
