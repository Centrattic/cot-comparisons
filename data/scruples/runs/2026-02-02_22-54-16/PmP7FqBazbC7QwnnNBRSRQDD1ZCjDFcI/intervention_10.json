The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he has a girlfriend, Amy, and he's planning a trip with a female friend, Melissa. They were supposed to go with their group of friends, but it got down to just them two. He didn't invite his girlfriend because Melissa thought it was too soon. Then, when they were alone, Melissa confessed her feelings and tried to kiss him. He told her he wasn't feeling well and left.\n\nHe told Amy what happened, and she's upset that he's still going on the trip with Melissa. He argues that it's about the money because he already paid for non-refundable parts. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, from Amy's perspective, it's understandable that she feels insecure. Even though he's not cheating, going on a trip alone with a friend who has feelings for him might make her uncomfortable. She might be worried about the potential for something to happen, even if he doesn't intend it. Trust is important in a relationship, but so is respecting her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't doing anything illegal or breaking an explicit rule. They are just friends, and he's not engaging in any physical contact. He's also been upfront with Amy about the situation. However, the trip was planned in a way that excluded his girlfriend, which might have contributed to Amy's discomfort. The fact that Melissa expressed her feelings adds another layer here. Even if he didn't reciprocate, being alone with someone who is in love with you could be a recipe for tension.\n\nBut the core issue is whether going on the trip is appropriate. The author believes that as long as they don't act inappropriately, it's okay. Amy disagrees because the situation itself is risky. It's a matter of whether the potential for misunderstanding or the appearance of impropriety is enough to warrant canceling the trip.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to reassure Amy that nothing would happen, but she's not convinced. The author might not be in the wrong in a legal or moral sense, but he's also not considering how this might affect Amy's trust and their relationship. The fact that Amy is getting upset and feels the need to interrogate him suggests that the trip is causing more harm than the financial loss he's concerned about.\n\nSo, even though he's not necessarily doing anything wrong, the decision to go on the trip despite his girlfriend's clear discomfort could be seen as inconsiderate. The financial aspect is a valid concern, but relationships often require sacrifices. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for prioritizing money over his partner's feelings.\n"
