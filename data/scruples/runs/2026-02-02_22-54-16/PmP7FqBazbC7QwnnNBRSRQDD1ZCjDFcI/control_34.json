The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning a trip with Melissa, his friend who's in love with him, while he's in a relationship with Amy. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a girlfriend, Amy, and a friend Melissa. They planned a trip to Hawaii, which Melissa coordinated. Initially, they thought the group would go, but it ended up being just them two. Amy was okay with it as friends. Then, Melissa confessed her feelings and tried to kiss him, which he rejected. Now, Amy is upset that he's still going on the trip with her, even though he says it's just about the money and not wanting to waste non-refundable payments.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by proceeding with the trip. Let's break down the factors. \n\n1. **Fidelity in Relationships**: Being in a relationship usually requires trust and avoiding situations that could lead to misunderstandings or betrayals. Even if the author isn't cheating, being alone with an ex or a friend who has feelings can be seen as risky. Melissa has made her feelings clear, which complicates things.\n\n2. **Amy's Perspective**: Amy is concerned about the appropriateness of the trip. Even if the author claims to be trustworthy, her feelings matter here. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration. If she's uncomfortable, ignoring her feelings might be dismissive of her needs.\n\n3. **Intentions vs. Actions**: The author says he's not trying to do anything inappropriate and that it's just about the money. However, the action of going on a trip alone with someone who is romantically interested in him could be seen as a breach of trust, regardless of intent. Actions can have consequences even if intentions are good.\n\n4. **Past Actions**: The trip was initially planned without the girlfriend, which Amy was okay with at first. But after Melissa's confession, continuing the trip might not just be about money anymore. The situation has changed, and what was acceptable before might not be now.\n\n5. **Communication and Trust**: The author believes Amy should trust him, but trust isn't just about the individual's actions; it's about how both partners feel. If Amy doesn't feel secure, forcing the trip could damage the relationship more than the financial loss.\n\nConsidering all these points, even if the author didn't plan to be unfaithful, the situation is problematic. The key issue is whether it's respectful to the girlfriend to proceed with a trip that could be seen as compromising the relationship. Melissa's feelings add an emotional layer that wasn't there before, making the trip potentially inappropriate. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the potential for the situation to be misinterpreted or lead to issues in the relationship. The financial aspect shouldn't override the emotional and relational aspects here.\n"
