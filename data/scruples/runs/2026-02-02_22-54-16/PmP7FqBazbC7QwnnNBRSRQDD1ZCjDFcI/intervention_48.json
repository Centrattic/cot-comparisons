The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate. WIBTA if I went on this trip anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who's in a 9-month relationship with Amy, and he planned a trip with Melissa, a friend of 3 years. The trip was supposed to be part of a group, but it turned into just him and Melissa because others couldn't agree. Amy was initially okay with sharing a room, but now after Melissa confessed her feelings, Amy is upset he's going on the trip alone with her. The author is considering going on the trip mainly because of the financial loss and trust issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The main issue is whether going on a trip alone with an ex-friend who has romantic feelings is appropriate, especially given the girlfriend's discomfort. The author argues that the money is a big factor and that Amy should trust him. But Amy feels it's inappropriate regardless of the financial aspect. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, partners generally expect each other to avoid situations that could lead to misunderstandings or breaches of trust. Even if the author intends to stay faithful, the situation is inherently risky. Melissa's feelings are a red flag, and the trip's setup (alone time) could create tension or temptation. \n\nThe author's defense is that the money is non-refundable, but that's more about convenience than ethics. Amy's concern is about the appropriateness and potential for issues, not just the money. The fact that Melissa made advances after the confession complicates things further. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but both parties should consider each other's feelings. The author might feel wronged if Amy doesn't trust him, but he also isn't considering her perspective. Melissa's situation is a bit complicated\u2014she's a friend with feelings, but she's not in a relationship. However, the author's relationship with Amy is the priority here.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't do anything wrong intentionally, the trip could be seen as neglecting Amy's feelings and creating a potentially harmful situation. The right thing would be to cancel the trip to respect his girlfriend's comfort and maintain trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for proceeding.\n"
