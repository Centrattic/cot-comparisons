The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn\u2019t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa\u2019s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it\u2019s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it\u2019s finally \u201cour time\u201d and that she\u2019s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she\u2019s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you\u2019ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she\u2019s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I\u2019ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I\u2019ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d cheat but I still think it\u2019s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn\u2019t have to go with Melissa but I don\u2019t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to go on a trip with Melissa, who is in love with him, while he's in a 9-month relationship with Amy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author and Melissa have been friends for three years and planned a trip. Amy was initially okay with them sharing a room as friends. But Melissa confessed her feelings and tried to kiss him, which he rejected. Now, Amy is upset that the trip still happens, even though the author insists it's just about the money and not wanting to waste the non-refundable payments.\n\nSo, the main issues here are trust, boundaries, and whether the trip is inappropriate despite the author's intentions. The author argues that he's not cheating and that the trip is just a financial commitment. Amy, however, feels hurt and sees the trip as a problem, possibly fearing that the situation could lead to something more or that the author is prioritizing money over her feelings.\n\nTrust is a big part of relationships. Even if the author feels he can handle the situation, Amy's perspective is valid. She might feel that the trip, regardless of intentions, is a risk to their relationship. Also, Melissa's feelings are now known, so the trip could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, even if he's not planning to act on it.\n\nAnother angle is the initial planning. The author didn't invite Amy because Melissa thought it was too soon, which made sense then. But after Melissa's confession, continuing with the trip could be seen as ignoring the emotional context. The author might be dismissing Amy's discomfort by focusing on the financial aspect, but relationships often require more than just logical reasoning.\n\nIn many cases, what's right or wrong can depend on cultural norms and personal values. However, the key here is how Amy is feeling. If the trip causes her distress and there's a risk of misunderstanding or her feeling neglected, the author might be in the wrong by not prioritizing her feelings over the financial loss.\n\nOn the flip side, if the author is confident he can maintain boundaries and has already committed financially, he might feel justified. But in terms of relationship health, respecting each other's feelings and avoiding potential pitfalls is crucial. The fact that Amy is now angry and questioning his commitment beyond money suggests that the trip is causing more harm than good.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not addressing Amy's emotional concerns adequately, even if his intentions are good. The trip could be seen as a breach of trust or as being inconsiderate of her feelings, regardless of his actions on the trip itself.\n"
