I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when they're seated in economy. The flight attendant reprimanded them, and the person walked away, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's rules. The user mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. That suggests maybe there's no strict policy against it. However, airlines might have regulations about which passengers can use which facilities, especially in first class. If the user isn't a first class passenger, using that bathroom could be against the rules, even if others do it.\n\nNext, the flight attendant's behavior. They were described as acting strangely, being strict with passengers, and making unusual announcements. The user's decision to use the first class bathroom might be seen as trying to avoid the long line, which makes sense. But when confronted, the user walked away, which is where the conflict arises.\n\nThe flight attendant followed and criticized them for walking away. The user argues they were just trying to end a lecture after a long day. But the FA's job is to enforce policies, and walking away might be seen as disrespectful. However, if the policy isn't consistently enforced, the FA's reaction could be excessive.\n\nThe user has premier status, which might give them some leeway, but that doesn't mean they can ignore rules. However, if the rules aren't clear or are inconsistently applied, the user might not be at fault. It's a gray area. The main question is whether using the first class bathroom is a violation. If it's not, then the FA's reaction is unwarranted. If it is, then the user did something wrong, but the FA's approach was harsh.\n\nAlso, the user's response\u2014interrupting the lecture and walking away\u2014could be seen as dismissive, but given the context of a long day and a harsh FA, maybe understandable. The FA's public shaming might have been unprofessional.\n\nIn summary, if using the first class bathroom isn't against the rules, the user isn't wrong. If it is, but the FA is being overly strict, then the FA has some fault. The user's response is debatable, but maybe justified given the FA's tone. So I think the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
