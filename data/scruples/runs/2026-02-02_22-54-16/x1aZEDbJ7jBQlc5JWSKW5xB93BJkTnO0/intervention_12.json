I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in the row behind first class. The author mentions they fly a lot and have premier status, which probably gives them certain privileges, like being in a seat near first class.\n\nThe flight attendant made an announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom before landing. The author then went to use the first class bathroom, which was only three rows ahead. When they came out, the flight attendant was waiting and gave them a lecture about using the wrong bathroom. The author walked away, and the FA followed, calling them rude for ignoring her.\n\nHmm, the key points here are whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. The author says they've done it before without issues, but maybe there's a policy against it. Airlines usually have specific rules about first class amenities being for first class passengers only. Even if the author is near first class, they might not be allowed to use those facilities. So maybe the FA is right in pointing that out.\n\nBut then, the author's response was to walk away and not engage. The FA followed them and spoke loudly, which might have been unprofessional. The author argues that they're not in the wrong because they didn't intend to cause trouble and have used it before without problems. However, if the policy is clear that only first class passengers can use that bathroom, then the author might be in the wrong for using it. On the other hand, if the policy isn't consistently enforced, the FA might be overzealous.\n\nThe author's action of walking away could be seen as rude since they didn't listen to the FA's explanation. But the FA was being loud and confrontational, which isn't professional either. The author might have felt disrespected given the FA's behavior. However, the initial act of using the wrong bathroom could be a policy violation. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author might have broken a rule by using the first class bathroom, and their reaction of walking away could be seen as impolite. But the FA's approach was also inappropriate. However, the main question is if the author is in the wrong. If the policy is strict, then yes. If the policy is flexible, maybe not. The author mentions they've done it before without issues, so maybe the airline isn't strict. But the FA might have different procedures now. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for using the wrong bathroom, but maybe the FA overstepped by following them and calling them out publicly. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on the policy. If there's a clear rule against it, then A. If the rule is ambiguous or inconsistently applied, then B. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the author might have violated a policy (even if others haven't been stopped), but the FA's response was unprofessional. But the act of using the wrong bathroom is the main issue here. So maybe the author is at least partially in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure.\n"
