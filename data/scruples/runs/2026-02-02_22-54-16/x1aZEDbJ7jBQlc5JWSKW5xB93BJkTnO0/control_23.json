I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, sitting in the row behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom or stowing carry-ons before landing. The author used the first class bathroom, which was accessible since it was only three rows ahead. When they exited, the FA confronted them, and the author walked away, leading to the FA following and calling them rude.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author violate any rules by using the first class bathroom? The FA is acting strict, maybe overstepping. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. But maybe there's a policy against non-first class passengers using that bathroom? If so, the author did something wrong. However, if the airline allows it, then maybe not.\n\nThe author's response was to walk away when lectured. Is that rude? Well, the FA was likely doing their job, enforcing rules. If the author is wrong, interrupting with \"thank you\" and leaving could be seen as dismissive. On the other hand, if the FA is being unreasonable, the author might feel justified.\n\nAlso, the FA followed and spoke loudly, which could be unprofessional. The author might feel harassed. But the question is about the author's actions. If the FA was correct, then the author is in the wrong for ignoring. If the FA was wrong, then the author isn't. But without knowing the airline's specific policies, it's tricky. However, generally, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers. So using it without permission might be against the rules. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for both using it and walking away. But the FA's behavior might have been excessive too. Maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they violated a rule, but their response was also rude. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author broke a rule by using first class bathroom, then yes. If the author didn't break a rule, then no. The story says the author has done it before without issues. Maybe the FA is being overly strict. But the author's action of walking away is rude regardless. So even if they didn't break a rule, walking away when someone is speaking is impolite. So maybe the answer is A. But the author argues that the FA was being unnecessary. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The FA's job is to enforce rules, and the author might have broken them. So the author is in the wrong for both using the bathroom and walking away. Therefore, answer A.\n"
