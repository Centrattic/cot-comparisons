I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for using the first class bathroom even though they're in economy, and then walking away when the flight attendant (FA) confronted them.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in an economy seat behind first class. There's a backlog in the economy bathrooms, but first class is empty. They use the first class bathroom. The FA then confronts them, the author walks away, and the FA continues to lecture them. \n\nNow, considering airline policies. I think most airlines don't allow economy passengers to use first class bathrooms. First class is a separate section, and their amenities are for their own passengers. So using the first class bathroom without permission is a violation. Even if the author has frequent flyer status, that doesn't grant access to first class facilities. \n\nHowever, the author mentions they've done this before without issues. That might mean the airline is inconsistent, but it doesn't make it right. The current FA might be enforcing the rules more strictly this time. \n\nThen there's the confrontation. The author walked away when the FA was lecturing them. The FA followed and made a scene. The question is whether the author had the right to ignore the FA. Even if the lecture felt unnecessary, the FA is enforcing rules. Disrespecting an employee doing their job could be seen as rude. The author's action of walking away might be considered disrespectful, hence why the FA was upset. \n\nBut the author's justification is that they were in a line and the FA was overly strict. However, the primary issue is using the wrong bathroom. The author's action in the first place is the main issue. But the way they responded by walking away and ignoring the FA is also problematic. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The initial action of using the first class bathroom is against the rules. Then, walking away from the FA while being reprimanded is also rude. So both actions contribute. However, the main fault is likely the initial use of the bathroom. But the follow-up action of ignoring the FA might be seen as rude. \n\nBut in terms of who is in the wrong overall, the author is probably at fault for breaking the rules. The FA is doing their job. The author's response was disrespectful. So answer A.\n"
