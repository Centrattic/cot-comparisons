I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author uses first class amenities even though they're not in first class. The flight attendant is strict and made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The author went to the first class bathroom when there was a line in economy. The flight attendant then confronts them, the author interrupts with a thank you and walks away. The FA then follows and calls the author rude.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault. Let's break down the factors. \n\nAirline rules might prohibit non-first class passengers from using first class bathrooms. If that's the case, the author violated a rule, which the FA is enforcing. But the author mentions they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. So maybe the rule isn't consistently enforced. \n\nThe FA's behavior is part of the context. She was already strict, making extra announcements, and reprimanding others. Her approach to the author might have been overly harsh. The author felt the lecture was unnecessary and just wanted to end the interaction quickly. \n\nThe author's actions: walking away after a brief \"thank you\" could be seen as rude, but considering the FA's tone and the author's own tired state, it's a matter of perspective. The FA followed them and made a public comment, which might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if using the first class bathroom is against the rules, the author is in the wrong for violating them. However, if the rules are not clear or inconsistently applied, the fault might lie more with the airline's enforcement. The author's response to the lecture is also a point\u2014choosing to disengage to avoid conflict could be seen as self-preservation rather than rudeness.\n\nThe key here is whether using the bathroom was a rule violation. If yes, then the author is at fault for breaking the rule. If not, then the FA overstepped. The author's prior experience (used it before without issues) suggests it's allowed, but maybe the specific flight or FA had different policies.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the airline's rules. But from the given info, the author might not be in the wrong if the rules aren't clear or if the FA was being unnecessarily harsh. However, the act of walking away when being lectured could be considered rude regardless. The author's justification is the long day and the FA's tone. So it's a bit of a toss-up. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. The answer is probably B (No), given the context and the FA's behavior.\n"
