I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after using the first class bathroom. The situation involves a flight attendant lecturing them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The person uses the first class bathroom, which is allowed because they're in a seat right behind first class. They've done this before without issues. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing, and there was a long line in the main cabin. The person went to the first class bathroom since it was empty. When they came out, the FA was waiting and gave them a lecture. The person responded by saying thanks and walked away, leading the FA to follow and criticize them for walking away.\n\nNow, considering airline rules. First class bathrooms are accessible to all passengers, not just first class. So using it isn't against any rules. The FA's behavior might be part of their job, but the person's reaction is key here. They interrupted the lecture to say thanks and walked away. Is that rude? Well, walking away while someone is speaking could be seen as disrespectful. However, the person might have been stressed after a long day and didn't want to engage. The FA followed and made a public comment about rudeness. \n\nThe user's dilemma is whether the author was in the wrong. The FA might be enforcing rules, but the author's actions of using the bathroom are acceptable. The problem is the interaction after. The author didn't follow up on the lecture, which could be seen as dismissive. But the FA's approach was harsh. \n\nIn terms of social norms, interrupting to thank and then walking away might be considered impolite. However, if the person felt the lecture was unnecessary, their reaction is understandable. The key is whether there was a violation of policy. If using the first class bathroom is allowed, then the FA's lecture is unwarranted. But the author's response to the lecture could be seen as rude. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's action of walking away was disrespectful, regardless of the FA's behavior. If the author didn't do anything wrong by using the bathroom, but responded in a way that was considered rude, then they might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the FA was being unreasonable, the author's reaction is justified. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. But in most cases, walking away from someone who is speaking to you, even if you feel they're wrong, is generally seen as impolite. So the author might be in the wrong for walking away and not engaging. However, the FA's initial lecture was inappropriate if the bathroom use was allowed. \n\nGiven that the author has used the bathroom before without issues, the FA's reaction might be over the top. But the act of walking away is still a breach of social etiquette. Therefore, the author is partially in the wrong, but maybe not entirely. However, in terms of the question, the answer is whether they're in the wrong. The correct answer is likely A (Yes) because walking away is considered rude regardless of the circumstances. But I need to check if there's a policy that the author violated. If not, then the FA was wrong. But the question is about the author's action of walking away. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for walking away and being rude, even if the FA was incorrect.\n"
