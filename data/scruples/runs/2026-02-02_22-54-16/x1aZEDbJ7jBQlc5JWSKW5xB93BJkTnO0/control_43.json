I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a flight attendant reprimanding them for using the first class bathroom, even though the author has done this before without issues. The key points to consider are the rules of the airline regarding bathroom use, the flight attendant's behavior, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they used the first class bathroom because there was a long line in the back, and the first class bathroom was only three rows ahead. They have premier status, which might grant them access to first class amenities. However, the flight attendant was upset and followed them to lecture about it. The author then walked away and ignored further comments.\n\nI need to check if there's a policy about bathroom access. Some airlines allow premium passengers to use first class facilities, but others might have specific rules. The author claims they've used it before without issues, so maybe this was an isolated case. The flight attendant's behavior seems harsh, reprimanding for something that might be allowed. However, the author interrupted the FA with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away, which could be seen as rude. The FA then followed them and made a loud comment about rudeness. \n\nThe author's defense is that they were stressed after a long day and didn't want to engage. But interrupting and walking away could be disrespectful. However, the FA's initial harsh reaction might have escalated the situation. It's a bit of a gray area. If the author was allowed to use the first class bathroom, then the FA was wrong to reprimand them. But if there's a rule against it, the author did something wrong. Since the author mentions they've done it before without problems, maybe the FA was overstepping. However, the author's response of walking away and ignoring the FA might have been inappropriate regardless. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the FA's behavior was unprofessional if there's no rule against using the bathroom, but the author's dismissal could also be rude. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for walking away, but if the FA was incorrect in her reprimand, then the author isn't. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering both actions, maybe the answer is B (No), because the author's action was within their rights, and the FA was being unreasonable. But the interruption and walking away might still be seen as rude. Hmm. It's tricky. The key is whether using the first class bathroom was allowed. If it's allowed, then the author isn't wrong. If it's against the rules, then they are. Since the author has a history of doing it, maybe it's permitted. So the FA was wrong to lecture them. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
