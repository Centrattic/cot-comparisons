I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for using the first class bathroom when there was a long line in economy, and then walking away when the flight attendant lectured them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's rules. The user mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues, so maybe the rule isn't strictly enforced. But the flight attendant's announcement suggested that using the bathroom now was necessary, which might imply that certain areas are restricted. However, the user was in a seat right behind first class, so maybe the first class bathroom is accessible to them. I'm not sure if that's the case. Some airlines allow premium passengers to use first class amenities, but others don't. If the user has premier status, maybe they're allowed to use the first class facilities. But the flight attendant's reaction suggests it's against the policy. \n\nThen there's the interaction part. The flight attendant is angry and follows the user to their seat, lecturing them. The user says they had a long day and didn't want to listen. They responded politely but walked away. The flight attendant then says it's rude to walk away. \n\nFrom a customer service perspective, the flight attendant's job is to enforce rules, but their approach here seems harsh. The user might not have known the rule or thought it was okay since they've done it before. The user's response was to say \"thank you\" and leave, which is a reasonable way to end a conversation when they don't want to engage further. The flight attendant's loud comment in front of others could be seen as unprofessional. \n\nSo, the main points are: was using the first class bathroom a violation, and was the user's response rude? If the user was allowed to use it, then the FA was wrong to reprimand them. If not, maybe the user is in the wrong for breaking the rule. But the user's prior experience suggests that it's permissible. Also, walking away after a polite response might be justified if the user felt the lecture was unnecessary or harsh. The FA's behavior in following and making a loud statement could be part of the issue. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have premier status and the FA's reaction was excessive. The user's action might be against policy, but the FA's approach was inappropriate. So answer B.\n"
