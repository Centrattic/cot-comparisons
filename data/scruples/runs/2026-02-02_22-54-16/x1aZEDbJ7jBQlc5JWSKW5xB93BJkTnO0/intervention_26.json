I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're seated in the row behind first class. The flight attendant lectured them for it, and the person walked away.\n\nFirst, I need to check the airline's rules. The author mentions they frequently fly and have premier status, so maybe they're familiar with the rules. But if the flight attendant didn't mention the bathroom restrictions before, that's a problem. The key point is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. If it was, then the author did something wrong. But if the rules weren't clear or the FA didn't inform passengers, then maybe not.\n\nThe author used the bathroom when there was a long line in their class and the first class one was empty. They might have thought it was okay. The FA's reaction seems harsh, especially following them and speaking loudly. The author's response was to walk away, which can be seen as rude, but they felt harassed after the lecture. \n\nAlso, the FA was being strict with other passengers, so maybe there's inconsistency. The author's status might have led to different treatment. But the main issue is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. If it was, then the author is at fault. If not, the FA overreacted. Since the author says they've used it before without issues, maybe the rules aren't clear. So the fault might be on the FA's inconsistent enforcement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
