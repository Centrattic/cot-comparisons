I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a frequent flyer with premier status, sitting in the row behind first class. There's a flight attendant who's been strict with rules. During the pre-landing announcement, there's a rush for the back bathrooms, but the first class bathroom is empty. The author uses it, then the FA confronts them. The author interrupts with a polite \"thank you\" and walks away. The FA follows, calls them rude, and the author ignores her.\n\nThe author's defense: They've used the front bathroom before without issues, and they felt the lecture was unnecessary. They were tired and didn't want to engage.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The key points are whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. If the airline allows premier status holders to use first class amenities, then the author did nothing wrong. However, if the rules strictly prohibit it unless upgraded, then they're at fault. But the author mentions they've used it before without being reprimanded, which suggests maybe it's allowed.\n\nThe flight attendant's behavior is questionable. She waited by the door, then followed and yelled in public. That's unprofessional. The author's response was to walk away after a polite acknowledgment. Walking away isn't inherently rude if one feels the situation is unfair or if the other person is being aggressive. The FA's loud reprimand in front of others escalated the situation.\n\nAlso, considering the context: the author was in a long line for the back bathrooms when the first class one was empty. It's reasonable to take the available option. The FA's strictness might be part of her job, but her approach was harsh. The author's action of walking away was a way to avoid further conflict, especially after being tired from work.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The FA's conduct was unprofessional, and the author's response was a way to de-escalate. The main question is about the rules\u2014whether using first class bathroom was permitted. Since prior usage without issues implies it's allowed, the author's action was justified. Thus, the answer is B.\n"
