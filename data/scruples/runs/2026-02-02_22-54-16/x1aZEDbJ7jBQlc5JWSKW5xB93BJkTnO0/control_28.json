I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in a seat right behind first class. The flight attendant lectured them, and the author walked away, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. Even if the person is in a premium seat, are there specific guidelines about bathroom usage? Some airlines might allow economy passengers to use first class restrooms if space allows, but maybe there are certain times or circumstances. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues, which suggests it might be permitted under normal conditions. However, the flight attendant made an announcement during the descent phase, which is a time when certain activities are restricted for safety. If the FA's announcement was about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom now, maybe that's when the rules are stricter, and using the first class bathroom during that time could be against protocol. The author might have ignored the rules by using the bathroom when they shouldn't have, leading to the lecture.\n\nNext, the author's response. When the FA approached, they interrupted the lecture with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away. This seems dismissive and disrespectful. Even if the author felt the FA was being overly strict, walking away and ignoring them after being followed could be seen as rude, as the user acknowledges. The FA's job is to enforce rules and ensure safety, so the author's reaction might have been unprofessional and discourteous.\n\nHowever, the FA's behavior was also questionable. The user mentions the FA was acting bizarrely, reprimanding passengers for minor things, making unnecessary announcements. The author's long day and stress could be a mitigating factor. But even so, the appropriate response would be to calmly address the situation, perhaps by explaining if there was a mistake, rather than walking away.\n\nThe key points are whether using the bathroom violated any rules (possibly during the announcement phase) and how the author reacted. If the rules were clear and the author broke them, then the FA was doing their job. The author's response, though, was rude. But if the rules weren't clear or the FA was being overly strict, the author might have a point. However, given that the FA followed up and the author ignored them, the author's actions were unprofessional. So, it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of their dismissive behavior towards the flight attendant.\n"
