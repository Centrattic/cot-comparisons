I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom and then being lectured by a flight attendant, leading to the author walking away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The author mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. That suggests that maybe there's no strict rule against it, or if there is, it's not consistently enforced. However, just because it's been done before doesn't mean it's allowed. Airlines might have policies about first class amenities being for first class passengers only. The author is in a seat behind first class, so they might not be entitled to use that bathroom. But if the flight attendant didn't mention it before, the author might not have known.\n\nNext, the flight attendant's actions. The FA was already acting strict, making extra announcements, and was clearly upset. The author used the bathroom during a time when the economy class bathrooms were busy. The FA waited by the door and then lectured the author. The author felt harassed and decided to walk away, which the FA then followed and called rude.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author violate a rule? If yes, they might be at fault. If not, then the FA's reaction is unwarranted. The author's response of walking away could be seen as dismissive, but if the FA was being overly aggressive, the author has a right to set boundaries. The FA's loud reprimand in front of others might have contributed to the author's decision to leave.\n\nAlso, considering the author's status as a frequent flyer and premier member, maybe the FA's response was more targeted. The author might feel entitled to more leniency, but that doesn't necessarily override the rules.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away from someone mid-conversation can be rude, but if the conversation is a lecture or reprimand that the person doesn't want to engage with, it's a matter of personal boundaries. The FA's loud and public criticism might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the rules. If using the first class bathroom was against the airline's policies, then the author did something wrong. But if the policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced, the FA's reaction is more at fault. The author's response, while perhaps abrupt, could be a reasonable reaction to an uncomfortable situation. The FA's follow-up in front of others adds to the tension, making the author's choice to disengage more understandable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often prioritize empathy and understanding. The FA has a tough job, but so do passengers dealing with stress. The author's actions, while maybe not perfect, seem more about self-preservation than being in the wrong. So I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
