I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a flight attendant reprimanding them for using the first class bathroom when they were seated just behind first class. The user is a frequent flyer with premier status, so maybe they have some privileges, but not necessarily access to first class facilities.\n\nFirst, the flight attendant made an announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom before landing. The user went to the first class bathroom because the regular one was busy. The FA was waiting for them and lectured them for using the wrong bathroom. The user interrupted her, thanked her, and walked away. The FA then followed and called them rude.\n\nNow, the key points here are airline rules. Are passengers allowed to use first class bathrooms if they're in premium seating but not first class? The user mentioned they've used it before without issues, but maybe the airline's policy has changed or there are specific conditions. If it's allowed, then the FA overreacted. If it's not allowed, the user did something against the rules.\n\nAlso, the user's response\u2014walking away when being lectured. Even if they were wrong, interrupting and walking away could be seen as rude. However, the FA's tone and the situation (flight, crowded, after a long day) might have contributed to the user's reaction.\n\nThe author argues they didn't do anything to make her job harder and it's been done before without issues. The FA's follow-up public comment about rudeness might have been harsh. So the question is: was using the first class bathroom a violation? If yes, then the author is at least partially at fault. If it's allowed, then the FA was being unprofessional. The user's reaction depends on the validity of the rule. Without knowing the specific airline policy, it's hard, but generally, premium classes might have access to first class amenities. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Also, the FA's public reprimand seems unprofessional. So the answer might be B.\n"
