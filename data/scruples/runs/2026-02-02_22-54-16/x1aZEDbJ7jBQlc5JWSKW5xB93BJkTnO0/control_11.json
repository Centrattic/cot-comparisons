I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when seated in economy, leading to a confrontation with a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The author mentions they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. But maybe there's a rule against it, even if not strictly enforced. Flight attendants have to follow safety regulations, so perhaps there's a reason for separating classes, like emergency access or protocol. However, the author points out that there was a long line in economy and the first class bathroom was empty. That might be a mitigating factor.\n\nThe flight attendant's behavior is also a point. She was already strict with passengers, making extra announcements. Her timing of the announcement before landing could be part of a safety protocol to ensure things are stowed and bathrooms are used before landing. If the author used the first class bathroom during that time, maybe it was against the rules. But if the rules aren't clearly communicated, the fault might not be entirely on the passenger.\n\nThe author's response: they interrupted the FA to thank her and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude. Walking away while being lectured could be seen as disrespectful, even if the person is stressed. Social norms usually expect you to listen to someone who's speaking to you unless you're in a hurry or there's a safety issue. However, the author had a long day and wanted to avoid conflict, which is understandable.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If using the bathroom was against the rules, they might be at fault for breaking them. But if the rules aren't clear or consistently enforced, their action could be justified. The FA's harsh response might also be part of the issue. The key here is whether the author's action breached a clear policy. If there's no clear sign prohibiting use of the first class bathroom for economy passengers, then the author isn't wrong. But if there's an unspoken etiquette or safety rule, they might be in the wrong for not following it.\n\nAlso, walking away from the FA could be rude regardless of the situation. Even if the lecture was unwarranted, interrupting and walking off might escalate things. The FA's job is to enforce rules, so the author's dismissal could be considered disrespectful. However, given the context of a long day and a possibly overzealous FA, there's a balance.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might share some responsibility if using the first class bathroom was against the rules. However, the FA's aggressive response and the context of the situation (long day, previous strictness) might mitigate the blame. The answer hinges on whether the bathroom use was a policy violation. If it was, then A (yes), but if not, B (no). Since the author mentions they've done it before without issue, maybe the policy isn't clear, leading to B.\n"
