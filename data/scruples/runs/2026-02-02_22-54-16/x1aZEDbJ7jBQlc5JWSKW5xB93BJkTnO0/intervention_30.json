I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author frequently flies and has premier status, so they often sit near first class. During a flight, there was a long line for the back bathrooms, but the first class bathroom was only three rows ahead. The author used the first class bathroom, which they've done before without issues. When exiting, the flight attendant was waiting and lectured them. The author interrupted to thank them and walked away, leading the FA to follow and call them rude.\n\nNow, considering the rules. Are there specific policies about bathroom access for non-first class passengers? Some airlines might allow it, others not. The author mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without problems, so maybe it's permitted. If that's the case, then the FA's reaction seems inconsistent. However, if the airline's policy clearly states that only first class passengers can use that bathroom, then the author might be violating that.\n\nBut the author isn't a first class passenger; they're in a seat near first class. So using the first class bathroom could be against the rules. However, if other passengers in similar seats (like premium economy or business) can use it, then maybe it's allowed. The key here is the airline's specific policies, which the user didn't mention. But the author says they've done it before without issues, implying it's acceptable.\n\nThe FA's behavior seems harsh. Lecturing and following the passenger to call them rude might be unprofessional. The author's response of walking away after a thank you could be seen as dismissive, but if they felt the lecture was unnecessary, their reaction is understandable. The author's main point is that they didn't do anything to make the FA's job harder, and the lecture felt unwarranted.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might have technically violated a policy, but if it's not strictly enforced, maybe the FA overreacted. The author's actions in walking away could be considered rude, but if the FA was being confrontational, self-defense in a way by walking away might be justified. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. They used the bathroom in a way they've done before, and the FA's response was excessive. So the correct answer would be B.\n"
