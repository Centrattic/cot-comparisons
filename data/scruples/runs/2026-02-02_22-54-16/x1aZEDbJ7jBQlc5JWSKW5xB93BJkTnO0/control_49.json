I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they used the first class bathroom even though they were in economy class. The flight attendant got upset and started lecturing them, but the author walked away and then ignored her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline rules. Do passengers in economy have access to first class bathrooms? I think sometimes they do, especially on long flights. Maybe not all airlines, but if the author has been flying with them a lot and has premier status, maybe they're allowed. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issue. So maybe there's no strict rule against it here.\n\nThen there's the flight attendant's reaction. She was already acting strict with other passengers, being reprimanding for small things. The author used the bathroom when there was a long line in economy, and the first class one was empty. They had a long day and just wanted to use the bathroom. When confronted, the author interrupted and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude.\n\nIs using the first class bathroom allowed? If the airline allows it, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if it's against the rules, then maybe they are. Since the author says they've done it before without issues, maybe it's permitted. The FA's reaction seems harsh in that case. On the other hand, maybe the FA was enforcing a policy even if it's not common knowledge. The author could have been more polite in their response. However, the FA's loud lecture in front of others might have been unprofessional. The author's decision to walk away might be seen as rude, but if they felt harassed, maybe it's understandable.\n\nAlso, the safety regulations aspect. The FA mentioned safety, but the author argues that they didn't do anything to make her job harder. It's possible the FA was just stressed or had a bad day. The author's actions might be in the wrong for ignoring the staff, but if the staff was being unreasonable, maybe not. The key points are whether using the first class bathroom was allowed and whether the author's response was appropriate. If allowed, then the FA overreacted. If not allowed, the author did something wrong but maybe the FA handled it poorly. The answer might hinge on the airline's specific policies. Since the author's status allows them to choose seats near first class, maybe they're entitled to use it. So overall, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
