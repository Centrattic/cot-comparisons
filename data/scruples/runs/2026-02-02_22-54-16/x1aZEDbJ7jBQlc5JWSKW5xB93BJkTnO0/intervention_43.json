I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, which gives them certain privileges like choosing seats. They were in a row behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom or stowing carry-ons before landing. There was a long line for the regular bathrooms, and the first class bathroom was only three rows ahead. The author used the first class bathroom, which they had done before without issues. The flight attendant then confronted them, the author interrupted with a thank you and walked away, leading to the FA following them and calling them rude.\n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) Is using the first class bathroom when there's a long line in economy acceptable? 2) Did the author's response (walking away) cross a line?\n\nThe author mentions they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. So maybe the rules aren't strictly enforced, and the FA's reaction was unusual. The author had a long day and didn't want to engage. The FA's behavior seems overly harsh, especially since there's no line for first class. The author's response was to interrupt and leave, which could be seen as dismissive, but maybe justified given the FA's tone.\n\nSafety regulations might require certain procedures, but the author isn't violating a strict rule if others have done it. The FA's lecture felt unnecessary and harsh. The author's action of walking away might not be inconsiderate if the lecture was unwarranted. The FA's follow-up in a loud voice to call them rude seems more like escalation.\n\nSo, considering that the author didn't break a clear rule and the FA's response was excessive, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
