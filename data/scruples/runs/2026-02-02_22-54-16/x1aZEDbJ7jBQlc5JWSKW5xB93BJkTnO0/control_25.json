I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the first class bathroom as an economy passenger and the subsequent interaction with a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're a frequent flyer with premier status, sitting just behind first class. They used the first class bathroom before landing when there was a long line in economy. The flight attendant (FA) was already acting strict, making unusual announcements. After using the bathroom, the FA confronts them, and the author walks away, causing the FA to follow and reprimand them about being rude.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author's action: using the first class bathroom. Is that allowed? Generally, I think economy passengers can use first class lavatories if there's space, unless the flight is full and first class is occupied. The author says they've done it before without issue. The FA's reaction is that it's the \"wrong\" bathroom, but maybe there's a rule against it now? Or perhaps the FA had a specific reason, like safety protocols if the plane is about to land. However, the author used it before landing, during the time when the FA told everyone to stow carry-ons and use the bathroom. So maybe the timing was okay.\n\nThe author's response was to interrupt the FA's lecture with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walk away. The FA then followed them, speaking loudly about being rude. The author's justification is that they were tired and didn't want to listen, leading to the walk away.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they might have broken a rule by using the first class bathroom, even if others don't enforce it. The FA's job is to enforce policies, so the author's action could be seen as violating company rules. On the other hand, the FA was being overly strict and the author had a valid reason (need to use the bathroom, long line). The author's response of walking away might be rude, but the FA's initial reaction could have been handled more calmly.\n\nIn terms of flight regulations, if the airline allows it, the author isn't wrong. If they're against policy, then maybe they are. But since the author has done it before without issue, maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced. The FA's reaction seems harsh, especially if the author was just trying to be efficient. The author's interruption and walking away could be seen as disrespectful, but the FA followed and made a scene, which is also unprofessional.\n\nSo balancing both sides: the author might be slightly in the wrong for using the bathroom if it's against policy, but the FA's handling was also poor. However, the main question is the author's responsibility. If the action was against the rules, even if others don't enforce them, they might be at fault. But if it's allowed, then the FA was being unfair. Since the author mentions they've used it before without issues, the policy might not be clear. The act of walking away after being confronted is rude, regardless. So maybe the author is partially at fault for that. But the initial bathroom use might not be a major issue. Hmm. So answer A or B?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person's actions that are against rules or polite even if in a stressful situation. The author's walk away is a clear breach of etiquette. So the answer is A (author is in the wrong) for walking away from the FA when being addressed. Using the bathroom might be a gray area, but the reaction is clearly the fault.\n"
