I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a flight attendant reprimanding them for using the first-class bathroom when they're seated in economy, right behind first class.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Some airlines allow economy passengers to use first-class restrooms if they're seated near the area, especially on long flights. But maybe there are specific rules here. The user mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues, which suggests it's not a strict no-go. However, the flight attendant in this case was particularly strict. \n\nThe user's action: using the bathroom and then walking away when the flight attendant started lecturing. They interrupted with a thanks and walked off. The FA followed and called them rude. \n\nFrom the user's perspective, they were in a hurry, had a long day, and didn't want to engage. They might feel the lecture was unwarranted since they've done it before. The flight attendant's behavior seems inconsistent if there's no policy against it. \n\nBut from the flight attendant's side, they're enforcing rules to maintain order and safety. If using first-class restrooms is restricted to first-class passengers, then the user is violating that. Even if others have done it before, the FA's job is to enforce the current policy. \n\nThe user's response of walking away when lectured could be seen as rude, regardless of the reason. The FA's comment about being rude in front of others might have been overreacting, but the user's action of ignoring and walking away might be disrespectful. \n\nSo, if there's no clear policy against using the first-class bathroom, the user isn't in the wrong. But if the airline has specific rules, then they might be. Since the user mentions they've used it before without issues, maybe the policy is more lenient. However, the flight attendant's overreaction could be due to a specific incident or policy change. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, interrupting with thanks and walking away might be seen as dismissive. The user could have listened politely and apologized if needed, even if they felt the lecture was unnecessary. Ignoring the FA could lead to escalation. \n\nSo, there's a mix here. The user might not be in the wrong for using the bathroom, but their response to the reprimand could be considered rude. The FA's behavior might have been excessive, but the user's reaction was also inconsiderate. \n\nHmm. I think the key here is whether the user broke a rule. If the airline allows it, then the FA was wrong. If not, the user is in the wrong for violating the rule. Since the user says they've done it before without issues, maybe the rule isn't strictly enforced. So the user isn't in the wrong for using the bathroom. However, walking away when being reprimanded is rude. So maybe the answer is B, but with a caveat that the user's reaction was inconsiderate, but the initial action wasn't wrong.\n"
