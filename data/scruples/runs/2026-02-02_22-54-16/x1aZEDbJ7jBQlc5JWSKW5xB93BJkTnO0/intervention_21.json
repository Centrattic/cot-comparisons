I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in the row behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) reprimanded them for it, and the author walked away and ignored further comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The author mentions that they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. So maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced every time. However, there might be a rule against non-first class passengers using that bathroom, even if it's more convenient. The key here is whether using the first class bathroom is against the rules. If it's allowed, then the FA's reaction might be unwarranted. If it's against the rules, the author might be at fault.\n\nNext, the FA's behavior. The author describes the FA as being \"bizarrely\" strict, reprimanding passengers for minor things. The author's action of walking away after being told off could be seen as rude, especially if the FA was just following procedures. But the author also mentions they were tired and didn't want to engage. In a public setting like an airplane, how should one handle a situation where a staff member is being overly harsh? Is it acceptable to disengage if the interaction is becoming confrontational?\n\nAnother angle is the context of the situation. There was a long line for the economy bathroom, and the first class one was empty. The author might have had a legitimate reason to use the less crowded one. If the FA didn't mention the rule beforehand, maybe the author wasn't aware. On the other hand, the FA's job is to enforce policies, so they might have a right to correct the passenger even if it's a minor issue.\n\nThe FA followed the author and spoke loudly, which could be seen as escalation. The author's response of walking away and ignoring might be a way to avoid conflict, but in a professional setting, how should one respond to criticism? The author's action could be justified if they feel the FA was being unreasonable. However, interrupting and walking away might come off as disrespectful regardless of the FA's tone.\n\nI also need to consider the perspective of other passengers. The FA made a public announcement, and the author's actions might have caused a scene. But if the author's action was a result of the FA's harsh treatment, maybe the FA is at fault for escalating.\n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not have broken any rules if the first class bathroom was accessible to them, but their response to the reprimand might be seen as rude. Alternatively, the FA's behavior could be part of the problem, making the author's disengagement reasonable. I think the key is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. If not, the author isn't in the wrong. If it was, then maybe they are, but the FA's handling of the situation could also be questionable."
