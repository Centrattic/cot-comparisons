I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author used the first class bathroom even though they're in economy, and a flight attendant reprimanded them for it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the rules. Are passengers allowed to use first class bathrooms if they're not in first class? I think on most airlines, it's allowed. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. So maybe the airline doesn't have a strict policy against it. However, some airlines might have specific rules, but the author didn't mention any policy here. The flight attendant is acting unusually strict, which might be the issue.\n\nThe flight attendant made an announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom before landing. The author went to the first class bathroom which was empty, while the economy line was long. The FA then confronted the author after they used the bathroom. The author felt it was a long day and didn't want to listen, so they walked away. The FA followed and called them rude for walking away.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't know there was a problem before, and the FA was being unnecessarily harsh. The FA's job is to enforce rules, but maybe they overstepped by being confrontational and loud. The author's action of walking away could be seen as disrespectful because they didn't engage with the FA's instructions. Even if the author thought the FA was wrong, interrupting and walking away without listening might be rude.\n\nBut wait, the author has Premier status and is a frequent flyer. The FA's behavior was already strange that day, reprimanding others for minor things. The author might have felt the FA was being unprofessional. However, the author's response was to walk away and ignore the FA, which could be seen as dismissive regardless of the FA's demeanor.\n\nSafety regulations usually require passengers to follow crew instructions. If the FA's instruction was about proper procedures for safety reasons, the author might have violated that. But if the rule is just about using the correct bathroom, and the airline allows it, then maybe not. The key here is whether using the first class bathroom is against the rules. Since the author did it before without issues, it's likely allowed.\n\nSo the FA might have been overstepping, but the author's response of walking away and ignoring the FA could be considered rude. The author should have at least listened to the explanation, even if they disagreed. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the FA's authority, even if the FA was being harsh.\n"
