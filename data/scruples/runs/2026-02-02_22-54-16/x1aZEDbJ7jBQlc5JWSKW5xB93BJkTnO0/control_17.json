I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe person is a frequent flyer with premier status, which gives them certain privileges like choosing seats. They ended up sitting in the row behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) was being strict and making extra announcements. Before landing, the FA told everyone to stow their bags or use the bathroom now. There was a line for the economy bathroom but not for first class. The person used the first class bathroom, which was three rows ahead. When they came out, the FA was right there and started lecturing them. The person interrupted and said \"thank you for telling me\" and walked away. The FA followed them, told others it was rude to walk away, and the person ignored her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break this down. First, is using the first class bathroom against the rules? The author mentions that they've used it before without any issues. But maybe the airline's policy says only first class passengers can use that bathroom. If that's the case, the author was in the wrong for using it. However, the author is in the row behind first class, so maybe they're in a space that's considered part of the first class area, but not actually first class. If the bathroom is reserved for first class passengers, then the author is violating the rules by using it. \n\nBut the FA's reaction seems a bit harsh. The author had a long day and was trying to use the bathroom when there was a line. The FA was already strict with other passengers, so maybe overreacted here. The author walked away during the lecture, which is rude in general, but was the lecture justified? If the author was actually violating a rule, then the FA has a right to correct them. But if the rule isn't clear or if the author's use of the bathroom is allowed, then the FA's reaction is unwarranted.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Were the author's actions against the airline's rules? 2) Was the FA's reaction appropriate? 3) Did the author have the right to walk away when being lectured?\n\nFor point 1, if the first class bathroom is only for first class passengers, then the author is in the wrong. But if the author's seat is in an area where using that bathroom is permitted, maybe not. The author mentions being in the row behind first class, which might be a premium economy or business class, depending on the airline. But the author's status is \"premier\" but not first class. So if the bathroom is for first class only, the author shouldn't use it.\n\nFor point 2, if the FA was being overly strict and making unnecessary announcements, maybe their reaction is part of a pattern. However, enforcing rules is part of their job. If the author is violating a rule, the FA needs to correct them.\n\nFor point 3, interrupting the FA and walking away is rude. Even if the person is frustrated, cutting off the conversation and not allowing the FA to explain is impolite. However, if the FA is being unreasonable, the person might feel justified. But generally, it's better to listen, even if you disagree.\n\nSo, putting it all together: If the author was using a bathroom they weren't supposed to, they are at fault. If the FA was being unnecessarily harsh, the author might have a point, but their action of walking away was still rude. The answer depends on the airline's rules. Since the author mentions the bathroom was in first class and they're not a first class passenger, they were in the wrong for using it. Therefore, the FA was right to correct them, and the author was rude to walk away. So the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
