I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by using the first class bathroom and then walking away when lectured by the flight attendant.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is flying with premier status, which gives them certain perks. They were seated behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom or stowing luggage before landing. The person used the first class bathroom, which wasn't busy, and then got lectured by the FA. They walked away and ignored the FA's follow-up comments.\n\nSo, the key points here are about airline policies regarding bathroom usage. Typically, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers unless the economy section is full. If this person is in economy, using the first class bathroom might be against the rules. Even if they've done it before without issues, that doesn't necessarily make it right. The FA's job is to enforce these rules, so the person might be in the wrong for violating them.\n\nOn the other hand, if the airline allows access to first class amenities for all passengers in premium status, then maybe the person isn't at fault. However, the FA's reaction suggests that the person was out of line. Walking away when being lectured by an employee is generally considered rude, regardless of the situation. The FA was doing their job, even if the person found it harsh. The author interrupted the lecture and walked away, which is a breach of common courtesy.\n\nEven if the author had a long day, it's still appropriate to acknowledge the employee's instructions. The FA's follow-up about rudeness is valid because walking away during a conversation is disrespectful. So, while the initial bathroom use might have been a policy violation, the act of walking away and ignoring the FA is definitely inconsiderate.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
