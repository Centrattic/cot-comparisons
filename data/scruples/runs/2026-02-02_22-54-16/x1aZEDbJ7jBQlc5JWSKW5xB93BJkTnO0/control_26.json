I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in an economy seat right behind first class. They used the first-class bathroom, which was empty, while the economy bathrooms had a long line. The flight attendant then confronts them, and the author walks away, leading to the FA following them and calling them rude.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The airline's rules: The author mentions they have premier status but doesn't specify if they're allowed to use first-class facilities. However, they note that they've done this before without issues. So maybe there's a policy about this. If the airline allows premier passengers to use first-class amenities, then the author might be within their rights. But if they're supposed to stay in their assigned areas, the author might be violating a rule.\n\nThe flight attendant's actions: The FA gave an announcement about stowing luggage and using the bathroom before landing. The author used the first-class bathroom, which was empty, while others were waiting in line. The FA then confronts the author, maybe because there's a rule against economy passengers using first-class facilities. If that's the case, the author is in the wrong for breaking the rule. But if the policy is unclear or the FA is being overly strict, maybe the FA is wrong.\n\nThe author's response: They interrupted the lecture to say thanks and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude. The author's justification is that they were tired and didn't want to engage. But walking away when being addressed by a staff member could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a professional setting. Even if the author felt the lecture was unnecessary, the appropriate response might have been to listen politely or ask for clarification, not to walk away.\n\nSafety regulations: The author mentions safety regulations, but the issue here seems more about policy than safety. If there's no safety concern, it's about following the airline's rules. The FA's job is to enforce these rules, so the author's actions might have been a breach of policy.\n\nThe author's history: They fly frequently and have premier status. If they've used the first-class bathroom before without issues, maybe the policy isn't consistently enforced. However, that doesn't excuse their current action if the policy is against it. The inconsistency in enforcement might be on the airline's side, but the author is still expected to follow the rules.\n\nThe FA's behavior: The FA was described as being \"bizarrely\" strict with other passengers, reprimanding them for minor issues. If the FA is known for being overly strict, maybe the author's frustration is understandable. However, the author's response of walking away might still be inappropriate regardless of the FA's demeanor.\n\nIn conclusion, if the airline's policy prohibits economy passengers from using first-class bathrooms, then the author is in the wrong for violating that rule. Their decision to walk away and ignore the FA's instructions is also a breach of etiquette and cooperation with staff. Even if the FA was being overly strict, the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful. However, if the policy isn't clear or allows premier passengers to use first-class facilities, then the FA might be at fault for incorrect enforcement. But based on the given info, the author likely broke a rule and reacted inappropriately.\n"
