I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after using the first class bathroom and then walking away from a lecture by the flight attendant.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is in a seat behind first class, uses the first class bathroom (which is allowed, I think, for premium passengers), and then gets lectured by the FA. The author walks away, leading to the FA following them and calling them rude.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break down the points. \n\nAirlines usually have rules about access to first class amenities. If the author has premier status, maybe they're allowed to use the first class bathroom. The FA might have a strict policy, but if the author isn't violating it, then maybe the FA overstepped. \n\nThe author mentions they've used the bathroom before without issues. This could mean the FA was being overly strict that day. The author's actions\u2014using the bathroom in a hurry, walking away when lectured\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since FAs have strict protocols to follow. But the author's justification is that the line was long and the FA was already being stringent. \n\nThe key here is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. If it's allowed for their status, then the author is in the right. The FA's reaction might be unprofessional. However, walking away mid-conversation can be seen as disrespectful. But given the context of a stressful environment and the FA's behavior, the author's response might be understandable. \n\nAlso, the FA followed the author and made a public comment, which could be unprofessional. The author might be within their rights if they didn't break any rules. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
