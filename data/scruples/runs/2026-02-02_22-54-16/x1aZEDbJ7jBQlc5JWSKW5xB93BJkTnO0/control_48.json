I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're seated in the row behind it, and then a flight attendant lectures them for it. The author walks away and is called rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The author mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. Maybe there's no strict rule against it. But some airlines might have policies where economy passengers can use first class bathrooms if there's space, especially during certain times like before landing when there's a rush. However, if the flight attendant felt it was against the rules, even if it's not commonly enforced, the author might be in the wrong for not following them.\n\nThen there's the interaction part. When the FA approached, the author interrupted her lecture to say thanks and walked away. That's probably seen as rude. The FA followed and said it's rude to walk away, which makes sense. Even if the author didn't agree with the rule, interrupting and walking away during a lecture isn't polite. The FA's job is to enforce rules, so the author's reaction might have been unprofessional towards her.\n\nAlso, the author has premier status. Maybe that's relevant. Do higher-tier passengers get more leeway? If the FA is strict, even a status might not matter, but the author's prior experience of using first class bathrooms suggests it's allowed. Still, if the FA is enforcing a rule at that moment, the author should comply or at least listen respectfully.\n\nThe safety regulations angle: the FA might be prioritizing a safety rule that economy passengers shouldn't use first class bathrooms during certain phases of the flight. But the author says they've done it before. Maybe the FA was following a new protocol or the author was in a situation where it was actually against the rules.\n\nSo, the main points are: did the author break a rule by using the first class bathroom, and was their response rude? If there's a rule, even if not often enforced, the author is in the wrong for not following it. Also, interrupting and walking away is disrespectful. The FA's job is to enforce rules, so the author's reaction is uncooperative.\n\nBut maybe the FA was being overly strict. The author could have asked why it's against the rules or politely apologized instead of walking away. However, the act of walking away after being confronted is likely the main issue here.\n\nSo I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they used the bathroom in a restricted area and then disrespected the FA by walking away and ignoring her. Even if the rule isn't always enforced, the FA's job is to enforce it when needed, and the author's response was unkind.\n"
