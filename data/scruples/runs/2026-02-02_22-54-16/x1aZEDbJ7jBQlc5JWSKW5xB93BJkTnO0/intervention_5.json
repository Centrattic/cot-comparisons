I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in the row behind first class, being lectured by a flight attendant, and then walking away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the specifics. The person has premier status and often flies, so they're familiar with the airline's policies. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The person used the first class bathroom because the line for the regular one was long, and there was no line up front. The FA then confronted them, the person walked away, and the FA followed, calling them rude.\n\nNow, the key points here. Are there rules about bathroom usage? The user mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. So maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced, or maybe it's situational. The FA's reaction seems harsh, especially since there was no line for the first class bathroom. That suggests that the flight attendant might have allowed others to use it if there was a wait, but in this case, maybe they wanted to prioritize first class passengers for some reason. But since the user was right behind first class, maybe they were expected to use their own bathroom.\n\nHowever, the user's response was to interrupt the FA with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walk away. That's where the conflict escalates. The FA then followed them and yelled about rudeness. The user is defending their actions by saying they had a long day and didn't want to listen to the lecture.\n\nI need to determine if the user violated any rules. If using the first class bathroom isn't prohibited for non-first class passengers, then the user isn't in the wrong. But if there are specific policies, maybe the user was in the wrong for not following them. However, the user mentions that they've done this before without issues, so maybe the policy isn't consistently enforced. The FA's behavior might be the issue here\u2014being overly strict or inconsistent.\n\nAlso, walking away from someone while they're talking could be seen as rude, but in this context, the user might have felt that the lecture was unnecessary. The FA's loud comment in front of others could have been an overreaction. The user's actions might be justified if they felt the lecture was unwarranted, especially since there was no line for the first class bathroom, suggesting that using it was acceptable at that time.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The user might not be in the wrong if the policy is flexible and the FA was being inconsistent. Their response, while perhaps not ideal, was a reaction to what they perceived as an unnecessary lecture. The FA's follow-up was unprofessional, which shifts responsibility towards the airline's staff rather than the passenger.\n"
