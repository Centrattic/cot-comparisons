I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is at fault. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, seated just behind first class. During a flight, before landing, the flight attendant (FA) makes an unusual announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom. The author uses the first class bathroom, which is only three rows ahead, and there's no line. Upon exiting, the FA is waiting and lectures the author about using the wrong bathroom. The author, after a long day, interrupts the lecture to say \"thank you for telling me\" and walks away. The FA follows and criticizes the author for walking away, leading to tension.\n\nThe author is wondering if they're in the wrong. They mention that they've used the front bathroom before without issues and acknowledge that FAs have tough jobs, but feel the lecture was unnecessary.\n\nI need to evaluate this from both sides. From the author's perspective, using the first class bathroom might be allowed if the airline's policy permits it, especially since they've done it before. The FA's reaction could be due to protocol changes or a specific rule they're enforcing. However, the author's action of walking away mid-lecture could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the FA's tone.\n\nBut the FA's behavior was also questionable. The user notes the FA was acting bizarrely, strict with rules, and making extra announcements. If the author's action didn't violate any rule, the FA's reaction might be excessive. The author's response might be a reasonable self-defense against perceived harassment. Also, the FA's loud comment in front of others could be unprofessional.\n\nHowever, the key point is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. If the author's status allows access, then the FA's reprimand is unwarranted. If there's a policy against it, the author is at fault. But the user says the author has used it before without issues, suggesting the policy might not be strictly enforced. \n\nThe FA's lecture and following the author to their seat to criticize them for walking away seems like overstepping, especially if the author was just trying to avoid an unnecessary argument. The author's interruption was a polite acknowledgment, not rudeness. Walking away might be a reasonable choice given the FA's tone and the author's stress.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author might not be wrong if using the bathroom was allowed, and the FA's reaction was unprofessional. The author's response was a way to end the interaction respectfully without escalating it. Therefore, the answer is B (Not at fault).\n"
