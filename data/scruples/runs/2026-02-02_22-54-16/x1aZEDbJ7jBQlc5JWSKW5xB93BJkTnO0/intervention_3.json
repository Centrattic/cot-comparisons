I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is a frequent flyer with premier status, often sitting behind first class. The flight attendant made an unusual announcement about using the bathroom or stowing carry-ons before landing. There was a long line for the regular bathroom, but the first class one was empty. The author used the first class bathroom, which they've done before without issues. The flight attendant then confronted them, leading to a lecture and the author walking away, which resulted in the FA calling them rude.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let me consider the factors. \n\nFirst, are there rules against using the first class bathroom if you're not in first class? If the airline's policy allows it, then the author isn't wrong. The user mentions they've used it before without being told off, so maybe it's permitted. However, maybe there's a policy change or specific rules on this flight. The flight attendant might be enforcing a rule the author wasn't aware of. But the user says the FA was acting \"bizarrely\" with strict rules, so maybe this wasn't a standard rule but an overreaction.\n\nNext, the author walked away when the FA was lecturing. The user says they had a long day and didn't want to listen. Cutting off the lecture by saying thanks and walking away could be seen as rude. The FA followed and said it's rude to walk away. The author then ignored her. \n\nBut in high-stress situations, especially in customer service, professionals are trained to handle such scenarios. If the FA was being confrontational, the author might not be at fault for disengaging. However, walking away mid-conversation can be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the situation. \n\nAlso, the user has a history of using first class amenities without issues. If the FA's reaction was unprovoked or based on a non-existent rule, the author isn't wrong. But if there was a valid rule they violated, then maybe they are. Since the user is unsure and mentions that no one has stopped them before, it's likely not a standard rule. \n\nBalancing both sides: The FA's behavior might have been over the top, and the author's response, while perhaps abrupt, was a way to avoid an escalation. However, the act of walking away during a confrontation could be seen as rude, even if the FA was being unreasonable. But the user's intention was to end the lecture, not to be disrespectful. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The FA's strict enforcement and the author's choice to avoid a conflict by walking away makes sense given the context. The key points are the absence of prior complaints and the flight attendant's unusually strict behavior. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
