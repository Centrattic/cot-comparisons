I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when seated in economy, behind first class. The flight attendant reprimanded them, and the author walked away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Do they allow economy passengers to use first class bathrooms? The user mentions they've done this before without issues. That suggests maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced, but perhaps there's a rule against it. However, the user is a frequent flyer with premier status, so maybe they assume they can use first class facilities more freely. But if the flight attendant is enforcing a rule, even if it's not common, the author might be in the wrong for violating it.\n\nNext, the context: the bathroom was in front, with no line, so practicality might have driven the action. The flight attendant's behavior seems harsh, but the author interrupted the FA with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away. That's probably the main issue. The author didn't just leave quietly; they ignored the FA's follow-up and were rude in response. Even if the policy is unclear, walking away and being dismissive is disrespectful.\n\nThe FA's job is to enforce rules and ensure safety. If there's a policy against using first class amenities without being a first class passenger, the author broke that. But maybe the policy isn't clear. However, the FA did inform them, and the author's response was to walk away and ignore further communication. That's where the TA (they asked if they're in the wrong) comes into play. The author's actions could be seen as rude and dismissive regardless of the initial policy. Even if the FA was overly strict, the proper response would be to comply politely or question the policy later, not to walk away during a lecture.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for walking away and being rude, even if their initial action of using the bathroom wasn't the biggest mistake. The key is their reaction to the FA's reprimand. The answer is A.\n"
