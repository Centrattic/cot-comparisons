I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about using the first class bathroom and then walking away from a flight attendant's lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, sitting just behind first class. During the flight, the flight attendant made an unusual announcement about using the bathroom now. There was a long line at the back, but the first class bathroom was empty. The author went to the front one, and when exiting, the FA was waiting and lectured them. The author interrupted to thank her and walked away, ignoring further comments.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the author use the bathroom incorrectly? Are there rules against that? The author mentions they've done it before without issues. However, maybe this time the FA had a specific rule. But the author's actions were out of necessity, given the line. \n\nThen, when confronted, the author walked away. The FA followed and criticized them for walking away. The author felt it was a bombardment after a long day. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's think about company policies. Airlines might have rules about which bathrooms can be used by whom. If the author is in economy, maybe they can't use first class facilities. But the author's status might grant some privileges. However, the flight attendant's job is to enforce these rules. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's action of walking away could be seen as disrespectful. Even if they felt the lecture was unnecessary, interrupting and walking off could escalate the situation. The FA's job is stressful, and the author's response might make it harder. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they were in a hurry and had a long day. The FA's approach was overly harsh. However, the core issue is about adherence to rules. If the bathroom was restricted to first class passengers, then using it was a violation. But the author might not have known, and the FA's reaction was disproportionate.\n\nAlso, the author did acknowledge the FA by thanking them, but walked away. That's a way to disengage, but maybe not the best approach.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Potentially for using the wrong bathroom if there's a policy against it. But if the policy is unclear and the author had done it before without issues, maybe the FA overstepped. However, the main issue is the walk away. In a professional setting, walking away when being addressed can be seen as disrespectful regardless of the situation. Even if the FA was being harsh, the appropriate response would be to listen until done, then express concerns if needed. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for walking away, even if the initial action (using the bathroom) was questionable. The FA's job requires maintaining order, and the author's response could be seen as rude. However, if the flight attendant's actions were unprofessional, maybe both are at fault. But the question is about the author. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's action of walking away when being addressed by the FA is likely the main issue here. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
