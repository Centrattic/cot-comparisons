I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author used the first class bathroom even though they were in economy class. The flight attendant was upset and started lecturing them, so the author walked away and ignored the FA.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the rules. Airlines usually have specific policies about which bathrooms passengers can use. If the author is in economy, they might be restricted to economy bathrooms. Even if there's no line, using first class facilities without being in first class could be against the rules. The FA's job is to enforce these policies, so the author might have broken a rule here.\n\nThe author mentions that they've done this before without issues. However, just because it's been done before doesn't mean it's allowed. The airline's policy might have changed, or the FA that time was more lenient. The key is whether the author was aware of the rules. If they knew they were in economy and shouldn't use first class bathrooms, then using it was wrong. But if they genuinely thought it was allowed, maybe there's some misunderstanding.\n\nThen, when confronted, the author walked away and ignored the FA. The FA followed and called them rude. Walking away when someone is talking to you could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a professional setting. The author might be in the wrong here because they didn't address the FA's concerns properly. Even if the FA was being harsh, the appropriate response would be to acknowledge the mistake and apologize, not to ignore them.\n\nHowever, the FA's behavior might also be part of the issue. If the FA was already being overly strict and making extra announcements, maybe the author felt justified in their actions. But that doesn't excuse the author's behavior. The FA is still enforcing rules, and the author's response was dismissive.\n\nSo, breaking it down: using the wrong bathroom is likely against the airline's policy, making the author at fault there. Then, walking away and ignoring the FA is disrespectful, adding to the problem. The FA's tone might have been harsh, but the author still had a responsibility to handle the situation politely. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for both actions.\n"
