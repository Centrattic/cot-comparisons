I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they were sitting in a seat right behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) was strict and gave them a hard time, then the author walked away when the FA was lecturing them. Now they're asking if they're the a**hole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the airline's policies. Are passengers allowed to use the first class bathroom if they're seated near it, even if they're not in first class? The author mentions they've used it before without issues. So maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced. However, the FA is now telling them they used the wrong bathroom. Maybe there's a rule against non-first class passengers using that bathroom, even if it's closer.\n\nThe author's actions: they used the bathroom when it was more convenient, especially with a long line in their own section. That's understandable, especially after a long day. But if the FA is enforcing a rule, the author might be in the wrong for not following it. The FA was doing their job, even if they were being a bit aggressive. \n\nThen the author walked away when the FA was lecturing them. The FA followed and called them rude for walking away during a conversation. Is it rude to leave when someone is scolding you, even if you feel it's unnecessary? The author might feel the lecture was unwarranted, but the FA is in a position of authority, so not engaging could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe FA's behavior might have been harsh, but that doesn't excuse the author's action of walking away. Maybe the author should have listened or at least acknowledged the FA's point. However, the FA was being loud and public, which might have escalated the situation. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author violate a rule by using the first class bathroom? If so, they might be in the wrong. If there's no strict rule, then maybe not. Also, walking away from an employee during a reprimand is generally considered impolite, so the author might be at fault there. But if the FA was being unnecessarily harsh, maybe the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether using the first class bathroom was against the airline's rules. The author's past experience of using it without issue suggests that maybe it's allowed. However, the FA's response implies it's against policy. If the author knew or should have known the rule, they're in the wrong. If the rules aren't clear, then the FA's strictness is more to blame. \n\nBut the author did interrupt the FA with a sarcastic \"thank you\" and walked away, which is rude regardless. So even if the bathroom use wasn't a big issue, the way they responded to the FA was disrespectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
