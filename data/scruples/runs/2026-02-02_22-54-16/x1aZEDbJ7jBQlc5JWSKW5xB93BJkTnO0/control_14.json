I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author used the first class bathroom even though they were sitting behind first class. The flight attendant then lectured them, and the author walked away, leading to further conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Airlines usually have specific rules about which bathrooms passengers can use. If the author is a regular flyer with premier status, they might be familiar with the usual practices. The key point here is whether using the first class bathroom when not in first class is against the airline's policies. The author mentions they've done this before without issues, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's allowed. Sometimes policies can change or be inconsistently enforced.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the flight attendant's behavior. The author describes the FA as being \"bizarrely\" strict with other passengers, making extra announcements. This could imply that the FA was having a rough day or was being overly rigid. However, even if the FA was being strict, the author's action might still be against the rules regardless of the FA's demeanor.\n\nThe author's response was to walk away when being lectured. In most social interactions, walking away during a conversation is considered rude. The FA followed and called them out for it, which the author ignored. The question is whether the author's action of walking away was justified. The author felt it was a long day and didn't want to listen, but interrupting with \"thank you for telling me\" and walking off could be seen as dismissive.\n\nAnother angle: the flight attendant's job is to enforce rules and ensure safety. If the author broke a rule, even a minor one, the FA's job is to address it. However, the author might not have known the rule, or the FA's approach was overly harsh. The fact that others were in line for the back bathrooms and the first class one was empty might have been a reason for the author to choose it, but the airline's policy probably expects passengers to use the bathroom assigned to their class.\n\nSo, if the author indeed violated a rule, then they are in the wrong. But if the rule isn't strict, and the FA was being overly harsh, maybe not. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the action violated a rule and the appropriateness of walking away. Since the author did ignore the FA's instructions and walked away, which is rude, and possibly broke a rule, that's two issues. So the author might be in the wrong (A), but if the rule wasn't clear, maybe not. But given that the FA was following her job, the author's actions were probably wrong.\n"
