I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in economy, right behind it. The flight attendant got upset and followed them to lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Do airlines allow economy passengers to use first class bathrooms? I think it's possible in some cases, especially if the first class area is unoccupied or near the economy section. The user mentioned they've used the front bathroom before without issues, so maybe it's permitted. But maybe the flight attendant was enforcing a rule that wasn't communicated well.\n\nThen there's the part about interrupting the FA and walking away. The user said they were tired and didn't want to listen, so they cut her off. That's probably rude. Even if the FA was being strict, cutting someone off isn't polite. The FA followed and said it was rude, which the user ignored. That's a problem because they were confrontational.\n\nBut the user also points out that the FA was acting unusually strict, making extra announcements, and being stringent with rules. Maybe the FA was overstepping. However, the user could have explained they were unaware or asked why it was an issue. Walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the FA's behavior.\n\nSo, the user might be in the wrong for not handling the situation calmly. Even if the FA was being harsh, the appropriate response would be to listen, ask questions, or politely explain. Walking away and ignoring her escalates tension. The key points are the interruption, walking away, and ignoring the FA's remarks. So answer A (yes, in the wrong) makes sense.\n"
