I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So the question is whether the author did something wrong by using the first class bathroom and then walking away when the flight attendant reprimanded them.\n\nFirst, the background: The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, so they probably have some privileges. The flight attendant was acting strangely, being strict with rules and making extra announcements. Before landing, the FA made an urgent announcement about stowing bags and using the bathroom. That caused a line at the back bathrooms, but the first class bathroom was empty. The author used that one, then when exiting, the FA was there and started lecturing them. The author interrupted with \"thank you\" and walked away, then ignored the FA when she followed and called them rude.\n\nNow, the main points to consider. The author's defense is that they've used the first class bathroom before without issues and that the FA's reaction seemed excessive. The FA's side is that they have a job to enforce rules, and the author broke a rule by using the wrong bathroom. The author argues they weren't trying to cause trouble and that the FA was being unreasonable.\n\nSo, from a rules perspective, if the airline has clear policies about bathroom usage and the author violated them, then technically they might be at fault. However, the author mentions that no FA has said anything before when they used the first class bathroom. That could imply the policy is not consistently enforced. Also, the situation had a long line at the back, making the first class bathroom more accessible. The FA's behavior seems harsh, especially making a loud announcement about the author being rude, which might be unprofessional.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did interrupt the FA's lecture, which could be seen as disrespectful. But they were tired and the FA's reaction was aggressive. The author didn't escalate the situation beyond walking away, which is a reasonable way to disengage from a conflict. The FA following them and making a public reprimand might be more inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, walking away from someone when they're speaking could be seen as impolite in general, but in this context, the author was being lectured in a stressful situation. The FA's loud reaction in public might have been more disruptive. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to an unreasonable situation.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the FA's response was disproportionate. The rules might be clear, but if they're not consistently enforced, the author might not be at fault. Plus, the FA's behavior was unprofessional, so the author's choice to avoid conflict was justified.\n"
