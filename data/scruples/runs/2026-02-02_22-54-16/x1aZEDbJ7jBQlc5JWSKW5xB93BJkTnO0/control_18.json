I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person was in a seat behind first class and used the first class bathroom. The flight attendant (FA) was upset and gave a lecture, and when the passenger walked away, the FA followed and called them rude.\n\nSo, the key points here are the rules about bathroom usage. Airline policies can vary, but generally, passengers are allowed to use any bathroom if it's accessible. However, sometimes there are specific guidelines, like first class bathrooms being for first class passengers only. The user mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues, which suggests maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced in all cases. \n\nThe user's argument is that they didn't do anything wrong because they used the bathroom when it was convenient, especially since the regular line was long. They also felt the FA was being overly strict and that the lecture was unnecessary after a long day.\n\nBut the FA's perspective: She might have been enforcing a rule, even if inconsistently. Her job is to ensure passengers follow the airline's policies, so using a first class bathroom when not in first class could be against the rules. The user's decision to walk away during a lecture could be seen as disrespectful, even if they felt justified.\n\nNow, considering social etiquette, interrupting the FA and walking away might come off as dismissive or rude. The FA was doing her job, and the passenger's reaction might not have been appropriate, regardless of the FA's tone. However, if the policy isn't clearly communicated or enforced consistently, the passenger's confusion is understandable.\n\nAlso, the user had a long day and was stressed, which might explain their reaction. But in public service interactions, even if the employee is being harsh, the customer's response can affect the situation. The FA following them and speaking loudly might have escalated things, but the initial action (using the bathroom) is debatable.\n\nIn the end, if using the first class bathroom isn't explicitly allowed for non-first class passengers, then the user might have broken a rule. However, if the policy isn't clearly posted or enforced, it's a bit of a grey area. The FA's approach was poor, but the user walking away could be seen as inconsiderate. The question is whether the user's action was a violation, and if their response was justified.\n\nI think the answer is B (No). The user might have broken a rule, but the FA's harsh response and the inconsistency in enforcement mean the user isn't entirely at fault. Also, the user's stress and the FA's inappropriate escalation contribute to the situation.\n"
