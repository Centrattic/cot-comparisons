I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom as an economy passenger and then walking away from a flight attendant's lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, so they have certain privileges like seat selection. They were in a row behind first class, and the flight attendant was acting very strict. Before landing, the FA made an urgent announcement about using the bathroom or stowing bags. There was a long line in economy, but the first class bathroom was empty and only three rows away. The author used the first class bathroom, which they've done before without issues. The FA then confronted them, the author interrupted the lecture, said thanks, and walked away. The FA followed, called them rude, and the author ignored her.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. The author argues that they didn't do anything intentional to make the FA's job harder, and they've used the front bathroom before without problems. The FA's reaction seems harsh, especially since others were in a rush and the bathroom was available. The author's response was to walk away, which the FA then criticized as rude.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the FA is enforcing rules, even if they might be strict. Using the first class bathroom might be against the airline's policies, even if the author has done it before without being reprimanded. On the other hand, the FA's behavior seems overly aggressive, and the author's reaction might be a matter of personal choice in a stressful situation. The author might feel that the lecture was unnecessary and not worth engaging with, especially after a long day.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author broke any rules. If the airline's policy allows economy passengers to use the first class bathroom when it's unoccupied, then the author isn't wrong. However, if there's a rule against it, then the author is in the wrong for violating the policy. The story doesn't specify the exact policy, but the author mentions they've used it before without issues, which might imply that it's sometimes allowed, but maybe not always. The FA's reaction could be due to a specific situation, like during an announcement period when the crew is busy.\n\nAlso, the author's response of walking away after a brief acknowledgment might be seen as polite, but the FA's loud reprimand in front of others could be unprofessional. The author's right to avoid a confrontation is valid, especially if they don't feel the lecture is justified. However, in a professional setting like an airline, employees are expected to handle such situations calmly, and passengers should follow the rules if they exist.\n\nIn conclusion, if the author violated a policy by using the first class bathroom, they might be in the wrong. However, if the policy isn't strictly enforced or if the FA overstepped, the author's actions could be justified. Since the story doesn't clarify the policy, but the author has done it before without issues, it's possible they aren't in the wrong. The FA's behavior seems more inappropriate, making the author's response understandable.\n"
