I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a flight attendant reprimanding them for using the first class bathroom when they were seated behind it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The writer mentions having premier status and often sitting near first class. They used the first class bathroom before without issues. But maybe there are specific rules about which passengers can use which facilities. If the airline allows certain classes to use specific bathrooms, then the writer might have violated that. But the story says the flight attendant hadn't mentioned this before, and others were using the back bathrooms despite a line. The writer chose the first class one because it was less crowded, which seems reasonable.\n\nNext, the flight attendant's reaction. She waited for the writer, gave a lecture, and followed them to their seat, calling them rude for walking away. The writer felt the lecture was unnecessary after a long day. The flight attendant's approach could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's known for being strict. The writer's interruption with a polite \"thank you\" and walking away might be defensible as trying to end a conflict, especially if the FA was being confrontational.\n\nSafety regulations are mentioned, but the writer hasn't done anything that compromises safety. They just used an available bathroom. The FA's public reprimand could be unprofessional. The writer's action of ignoring her afterward might be justified if the FA was being hostile.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the writer break any rules? Maybe, but if previous FAs didn't enforce it, it's inconsistent. Was the FA's response appropriate? Probably not, given her history. The writer's reaction to a perceived unnecessary lecture might not be wrong. Balancing both sides, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
