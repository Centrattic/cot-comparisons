I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're seated in the row behind first class. The flight attendant got upset and lectured them, and the author walked away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Airline policies about bathroom usage\u2014do they restrict certain passengers from using first class bathrooms? I think some airlines allow all passengers to use any bathroom, but maybe there are exceptions when it's against the rules. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues, so maybe the policy isn't strict. However, the flight attendant might have a rule against it for safety or security reasons, like to prevent unauthorized access or to ensure first class passengers aren't disturbed.\n\nNext, the flight attendant's behavior. She was acting strangely before, being strict and making extra announcements. Maybe she was stressed or having a bad day. When the author used the bathroom, she was waiting and gave a lecture. The author interrupted to say thanks and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude. The author's response was to ignore her. \n\nWas the author rude? Walking away when someone is talking to you is generally considered impolite. Even if the person is being unreasonable, cutting them off and leaving might be seen as dismissive. However, if the author felt harassed or the lecture was unwarranted, maybe they had a reason to leave. The author mentions they had a long day and didn't want to listen to the lecture. \n\nBut the key point is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. If it's allowed, then the FA's reaction is the issue. If not, the author is in the wrong. The story says the author has used it before without problems, suggesting it's allowed. However, maybe this time the FA had a specific reason. The author could have asked to use it politely instead of just using it. \n\nAlso, the author's response to the lecture by walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the FA was overstepping, the proper response might be to acknowledge politely and move on, not ignore. \n\nSo, the author might be partially at fault for not checking the rules or asking, and for walking away. However, the FA's behavior was also inappropriate. The answer depends on whether the author violated any rules. If the bathroom was accessible, then the FA was wrong. If not, the author is wrong. Since the user mentions they've used it before without issues, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But the act of walking away is still rude regardless of the initial situation. So maybe the author is a little at fault for both using the bathroom (if it's against the rules) and walking away. But the story doesn't confirm any explicit rule against it. \n\nIn the end, the author's action of walking away was rude, so they might be in the wrong for that part, even if using the bathroom wasn't against the rules. The FA was also in the wrong for the lecture and raising her voice. The answer is a bit of both, but the main question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author walked away, which is impolite, they might be in the wrong there. So answer A (Yes).\n"
