I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The story is about someone using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in the row behind first class. The flight attendant reprimanded them, and the author walked away and ignored the lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the rules. Airlines usually have specific regulations about bathroom usage. First class bathrooms are typically for first class passengers. The author isn't in first class, so using that bathroom might be against the rules. But the user mentioned that they've used the front bathroom before without any issues. However, just because they did it before doesn't mean it's allowed. Maybe the flight attendants were lenient before, but this time the FA was strict.\n\nThe flight attendant made an announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom now. The author took that as a cue to use the bathroom. But the line was long in the regular area, and the first class bathroom was available. The author's reasoning was that they needed to use the bathroom and the first class one was closer. However, the FA saw it as a rule violation.\n\nWhen the FA confronted the author, they interrupted the lecture by saying \"thank you for telling me\" and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude. The author's defense is that they've done this before and the FA's reaction seems out of line. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have broken a rule by using the first class bathroom. Even if it's not enforced every time, the rules are there for a reason. On the other hand, the flight attendant's reaction was harsh. Yelling and following the passenger could be seen as unprofessional. The author's response was to walk away, which could be polite if done calmly, but interrupting the FA and walking away might have been rude.\n\nBut the author's main point is that they're a frequent flyer with premier status, so maybe they have some expectations of leniency. However, rules apply to everyone. The safety regulations part might not be directly relevant here unless the bathroom usage is tied to safety, which isn't clear. The author might not have intended to cause problems, but using the wrong bathroom is a violation regardless.\n\nThe key factors here are: 1) Did the author break a rule? If yes, then they'd be at fault for the initial action. 2) Was their reaction to the FA appropriate? Walking away after being lectured could be seen as rude, especially in a professional interaction. However, if the FA was being overly aggressive, the author might feel justified.\n\nIn terms of airline policies, most airlines do have rules against non-first class passengers using the first class amenities unless upgraded. So the author probably did violate a rule. However, the FA's response was unprofessional. The author's interruption and walking away might not be the best approach, but given the FA's behavior, maybe it's understandable.\n\nSo considering all that, the author is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom without permission. However, the FA's handling of the situation was also poor. But the question is specifically about the author's fault. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they violated a rule, even if the FA's response was harsh.\n"
