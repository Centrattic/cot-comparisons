I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom as a passenger in an economy seat.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The person has premier status and sits behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about stowing belongings and using the bathroom before landing. There was a long line for the economy bathroom, but the first class bathroom was empty. The person used it, then the FA confronted them. The person walked away, and the FA followed, calling them rude.\n\nNow, the key points here are the rules about bathroom usage. Airlines usually have specific areas for first class and economy passengers. Even if the person is a frequent flyer, using first class amenities without being upgraded might violate the rules. The FA's reaction could be about enforcing those policies. \n\nHowever, the person mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. Maybe the policy isn't consistently enforced. Also, the FA was being overly strict with other passengers, so maybe her reaction was out of line. \n\nThe user's action of walking away after being addressed by the FA could be seen as rude. Even if they felt the lecture was unnecessary, interrupting and walking away might be disrespectful. But considering the long line and the FA's behavior, the person might have felt justified.\n\nSo is the person in the wrong? If the bathroom usage was against the rules, then yes. But if the policy isn't clear or enforced inconsistently, maybe not. The FA's tone and approach might have contributed to the tension. The user's response (walking away) could be seen as a valid choice given their stress and the FA's aggression. Still, interrupting and leaving might be rude regardless. \n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The answer might depend on the airline's specific policies. Since the user has premier status but isn't upgraded, maybe the first class bathroom isn't available to them. If that's the case, using it was wrong. However, if the policy allows it, then the FA was being unreasonable. The user's response of walking away is more about personal choice in a stressful situation. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong if the FA was being excessive, but if the action was against the rules, then the user is at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the user's action might not be against the rules if they've done it before without issues. The FA's handling of the situation was worse, so the user isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
