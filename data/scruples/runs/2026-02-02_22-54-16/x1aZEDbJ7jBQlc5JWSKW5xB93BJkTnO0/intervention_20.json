I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after being lectured for using the first class bathroom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person has premier status and sits just behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. There was a long line for the economy bathroom but not for first class. The author used the first class bathroom, which is only three rows ahead. When exiting, a flight attendant confronts them, leading to a lecture, and the author walks away.\n\nI need to consider the rules. Airlines typically have specific policies about bathroom use. First class bathrooms are usually for first class passengers only. But the author isn't in first class, just sitting in the next row. If the airline allows non-first class passengers to use the first class bathroom when it's unoccupied, maybe the author was within their right. However, if the policy strictly prohibits this, then the author might be wrong.\n\nThe flight attendant's reaction is key. They followed the author to their seat and made a loud comment about rudeness. The author's response was to interrupt with a polite \"thank you\" and then walk away, ignoring further comments. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel the FA was being unnecessarily harsh, especially after the FA was already strict with other passengers. The author's work day was long, so maybe they were stressed. \n\nBut from the FA's side, they have a job to enforce rules. The author could be violating a policy by using the first class bathroom, which might affect safety or service. The FA's job is to maintain order, so confronting the passenger is part of their duty. The author's walking away could be seen as disrespectful, especially since the FA was trying to communicate a rule.\n\nHowever, if the policy isn't clearly enforced (since the author has done it before without issues), the FA's sudden strictness might be inconsistent. The author might not have known the rule, or the airline might not strictly enforce it. The author's action of walking away after a polite acknowledgment could be justified if they felt the interaction was unnecessary and the lecture unwarranted.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on the specific airline's policies. If the policy clearly prohibits using first class bathrooms unless upgraded, then the author is in the wrong. But if the policy is more lenient, allowing use when unoccupied, then maybe not. The FA's behavior also matters\u2014if they were being unprofessional, the author's response might be more acceptable. However, generally, respecting authority figures, even if they're being harsh, might be expected. The author's walking away could be seen as rude, especially in a public setting where others could overhear the confrontation.\n\nBut the author did acknowledge the FA's comment with a \"thank you,\" so maybe they were trying to be polite. The FA then escalated the situation by following them and making a public comment. The author's decision to disengage might be a reasonable choice to avoid further conflict, especially if they felt the lecture was unwarranted and the FA was being overly strict. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they might have a point about inconsistent enforcement and the FA's harsh reaction, but it's a close call. However, if the policy was clear, then A might be correct. Since the user says the author has used the front bathroom before without issues, the policy might not be strictly enforced, supporting B. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
