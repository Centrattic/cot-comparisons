I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in the row behind first class. The flight attendant lectured them, and the author walked away and ignored further comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The author mentions they frequently fly and have premier status. They've used the first class bathroom before without issues. The flight attendant's behavior seems inconsistent here\u2014maybe she's having a bad day or enforcing rules more strictly than usual. The author's action was using a bathroom that was available and closer, which might be allowed, especially if others have done it without problems. \n\nThen, when confronted, the author interrupted with a polite \"thank you\" and walked away. The flight attendant followed and raised her voice. The author's response was to ignore her. In such situations, flight attendants are supposed to handle issues professionally. The author might not have done anything wrong by using the bathroom and then disengaging from an aggressive lecture. \n\nHowever, walking away when someone is talking to you can be seen as rude, but in this case, the flight attendant was being confrontational. The author might have felt the lecture was unnecessary, especially since they were a loyal customer. Also, if there's no clear rule against using the first class bathroom in their seat class, then the author isn't at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the flight attendant had valid reasons, like protocol or safety, but the author doesn't mention any such rule. The key here is whether using the first class bathroom was against the airline's policies. Since the author has done it before without issues, it's possible the policy is flexible. The FA's reaction seems disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong. The FA's behavior was unprofessional, and the author's response was to avoid a confrontation, which is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
