I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after being lectured for using the first-class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author, a frequent flyer with premier status, used the first-class bathroom, which was empty, while there was a long line in the economy section. The flight attendant (FA) then lectured him, and he walked away, leading to her following him and calling him rude.\n\nThe key points to consider are airline rules regarding bathroom usage. Generally, airlines don't prohibit economy passengers from using first-class bathrooms if they're empty, unless there's a strict policy against it. The author mentions having done this before without issues. The FA's reaction seems out of proportion, especially since there's no line in first class. The user argues that the FA's behavior was harsh and unnecessary.\n\nThe author's response\u2014interrupting with a polite \"thank you\" and walking away\u2014could be seen as a way to de-escalate a tense situation. Given the FA was being loud and reprimanding others for minor issues, the author might have felt justified in disengaging, especially after a long day. The FA's follow-up in a public manner might have escalated things further.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. While using the first-class bathroom might not be against rules, the way the FA handled it could be unprofessional. The author's action of walking away might be seen as dismissive, but if the FA was being confrontational, it's a matter of personal boundaries. The author's history of flying and prior experiences without issues support his stance.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often weighs both sides. The FA's job is stressful, but their approach here was aggressive. The author did something that's generally allowed but chose to disengage from an unproductive interaction. The main question is whether the author's actions were rude or if the FA overstepped. Since the author had a valid reason to feel disrespected and chose a non-confrontational exit, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
