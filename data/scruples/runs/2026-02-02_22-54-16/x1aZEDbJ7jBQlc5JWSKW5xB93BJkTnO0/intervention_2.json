I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe person is a frequent flyer with premier status, seated behind first class. The flight attendant made an unusual announcement about using the bathroom now. There was a long line for the economy bathrooms, but the first class bathroom was only three rows ahead. The author used the first class bathroom, and when confronted by the FA, they walked away and ignored the lecture.\n\nHmm, first, the key points are: Did the author do something wrong by using the first class bathroom? The airline's rules might determine this. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. So maybe the FA's reaction was unexpected. Also, the FA was being strict and made extra announcements, which might indicate she was enforcing a rule that wasn't clear to passengers.\n\nWhen confronted, the author interrupted the FA's lecture to say thanks and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude. The question is whether the author was wrong for not engaging further.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, maybe they felt the lecture was unnecessary and they were just trying to avoid the long line. They might have assumed using the closest bathroom was acceptable, especially given their status. The FA's behavior could be seen as overzealous, especially if the rules aren't consistently enforced.\n\nBut from the FA's viewpoint, she's following protocol. If there's a rule against using the first class bathroom, even if it's not usually enforced, the author might be violating it. However, the author has prior experience where this wasn't an issue, so they might not have known the rule existed or was being enforced that day.\n\nThe author's response to walk away could be seen as rude, but they were stressed after a long day. Their interruption with \"thank you for telling me\" might have been a polite way to end the interaction. The FA's reaction was loud and public, which could escalate the situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong if the rules weren't clear. The FA's strictness and the author's choice to disengage to avoid conflict could be understandable. The author isn't necessarily rude for prioritizing their own comfort after a long day, especially if the FA's response was harsh. However, the fact that the author used a different bathroom could be a point in the FA's favor if it's against regulations.\n\nBut since the author has used the first class bathroom before without issues, maybe the rule isn't strict. The FA's unusual strictness that day might be the real issue here. The author's action wasn't malicious; they were trying to use the nearest available bathroom. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
