I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a flight attendant reprimanding them for using the first class bathroom, and then the author walking away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The user mentions that they've used the first class bathroom before without issue. If there's no explicit rule against it, maybe the flight attendant was being overly strict. But if there's a policy that economy class passengers can't use first class bathrooms, then the author is in the wrong.\n\nHowever, the author has premier status and sits right behind first class. Maybe the airline allows that, especially if there's no sign prohibiting it. The flight attendant's behavior seems inconsistent because they didn't mention this before. Also, the author was in a hurry and the line was long, so using an available bathroom makes sense.\n\nBut the main issue is walking away when being lectured. Even if the flight attendant was being harsh, interrupting and walking away could be seen as rude. The FA followed them and called them out for being rude, which complicates things. The author might have felt disrespected, but cutting off a staff member isn't ideal.\n\nI think the key points are: Was there a clear rule against using first class bathroom? If not, the FA overstepped. But if there was a rule, the author broke it. Also, the author's response (walking away) was disrespectful regardless. So maybe the author is partly at fault for not following the rules and for their reaction. But the FA's behavior was also problematic. However, in such scenarios, passengers should generally comply with staff instructions unless there's a clear mistake. Since the author had used it before without issues, maybe it's a gray area. But walking away is still impolite. So probably answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they shouldn't have walked away from the FA, even if the FA was strict.\n"
