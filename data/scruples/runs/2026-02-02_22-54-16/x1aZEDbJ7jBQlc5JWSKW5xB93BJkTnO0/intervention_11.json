I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a flight attendant reprimanding them for using the first class bathroom when they were seated behind it. The author then walked away and ignored further comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The user mentions that they've used the first class bathroom before without issues, so maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced. However, there might be unspoken rules or specific regulations about access to first class amenities. Even if the policy exists, if it's not consistently enforced, the flight attendant's sudden strictness could be the issue here.\n\nNext, the flight attendant's behavior. The FA was already acting strangely, being strict with other passengers over minor things. This context is important. If the FA's behavior is out of the norm, the author's reaction might be more understandable. The author had a long day and chose not to engage in a lecture, which could be seen as self-preservation rather than rudeness.\n\nThe act of walking away: The FA was following the author and speaking loudly. Walking away after being interrupted could be perceived as rude, but the author claims they were already tired and didn't want to engage. The key here is intent. If the author meant to be disrespectful, that's different, but they were trying to avoid an unnecessary confrontation.\n\nThe FA's loud reprimand might be more unprofessional than the author's action. Flight attendants are supposed to handle situations calmly, even if they're stressed. If the FA escalated the situation by following and speaking loudly, that's part of the problem.\n\nAlso, the author is a frequent flyer with premier status, so maybe they're more aware of the airline's usual practices. If the rules aren't clearly communicated, the fault isn't entirely on the passenger. The FA should have handled the situation more diplomatically instead of lecturing.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's action of walking away after being interrupted might not be in the wrong, especially if the FA was being overly harsh. The FA's response was likely more unprofessional. So the answer would be B.\n"
