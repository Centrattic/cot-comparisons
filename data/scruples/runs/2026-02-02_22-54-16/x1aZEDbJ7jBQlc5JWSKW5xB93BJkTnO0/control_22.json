I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author used the first class bathroom even though they're sitting in the row behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) was already being strict with other passengers, and after the author used the bathroom, the FA confronted them. The author interrupted the lecture, said thanks, and walked away. The FA then followed and called them rude for walking away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Airlines usually have specific areas for first class and economy. If the author isn't in first class, using their bathroom might be against the rules. Even if others have done it before, it doesn't mean it's allowed. The FA's job is to enforce these rules. So maybe the author did violate a policy.\n\nThen there's the interaction. The author was in a long line for their bathroom and the first class one was empty. That might be a practical reason, but still, the rules are rules. When confronted, the author walked away. Is walking away rude? It could be seen as disrespectful, especially if the FA is trying to explain a policy. However, the FA was lecturing, which the author found unnecessary. The author might have felt justified in ending the conversation quickly, especially after a long day.\n\nThe FA's response was loud and public, which could be unprofessional. But the author's action of walking away might have been rude. So it's a bit of a both-sided situation. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The answer depends on if using the first class bathroom is a rule violation and whether walking away from a staff member is considered rude.\n\nIf the airline's policy prohibits non-first class passengers from using their bathrooms, then the author is in the wrong for breaking the rule. The FA's lecture was enforcing that. Walking away could be seen as disrespectful, but if the author was stressed, maybe understandable. However, the FA's loud public reprimand might also be excessive.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author broke a rule. If yes, then they are in the wrong. If not, then maybe the FA overreacted. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues, but that doesn't mean it's allowed. Policies can change, or maybe others have done it and weren't caught. So the author's action was against the rules, making them at least partially in the wrong. Walking away added to the conflict. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
