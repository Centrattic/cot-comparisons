I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. I need to consider the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is a frequent flyer with premier status, so they probably know the usual procedures. They used the first class bathroom, which wasn't in their own class. The flight attendant was strict and made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The author went to the first class bathroom because the line in economy was long. \n\nThe key points here are the airline's policies. Do they allow economy passengers to use first class bathrooms? If the author is in economy, using first class facilities without permission might be against the rules. But the author mentions they've done it before without issues. That suggests maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced every time. However, the flight attendant in question was strict, so she might be enforcing it this time.\n\nThe author then walked away when the FA was lecturing them. Interrupting and walking off could be seen as disrespectful. The FA followed and called them rude. The author's response was to ignore her. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be justified if the policy isn't clear or inconsistently enforced. On the other, the way they responded (walking away and ignoring) could be seen as dismissive. The FA's job is to manage the flight, so even if the policy is a bit gray, the author's reaction might have been unprofessional.\n\nBut considering the FA was acting strangely and strict, maybe the author felt justified in not engaging. Also, the bathroom was close and the line was long. However, the FA's role is to enforce rules, so the author's actions could be seen as insubordinate. \n\nHmm. I think the author is partially at fault for using a first class bathroom without permission, but the FA's handling was harsh. The main issue is the author's response to the lecture. Walking away and ignoring might be rude, even if the FA was being strict. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't comply with the policy and responded disrespectfully. But some might argue the policy wasn't clear. Still, in a professional setting, you should follow established rules and handle conflicts politely. So yes, the author made mistakes here. Answer A.\n"
