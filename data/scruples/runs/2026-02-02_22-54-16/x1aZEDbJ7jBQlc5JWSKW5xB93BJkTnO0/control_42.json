I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their story again to understand the situation.\n\nThey're a frequent flyer with premier status, so they have certain privileges like choosing seats. They were seated just behind first class, and the flight attendant (FA) was being a bit strict. Before landing, the FA announced that if people needed to use the restroom or stow their carry-on, they should do it now. This caused a rush, and there was a line for the regular restrooms, but the first class bathroom was empty and only a few rows away. The person used the first class bathroom instead. When they came out, the FA was waiting and gave them a lecture. The person was tired and cut her off, said thanks, and walked away. The FA followed and called them rude. Now the author is asking if they're the a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. The airline probably has regulations about using first class bathrooms for non-first class passengers. Even if the person has premier status, that might not grant access to first class amenities unless they're upgraded. So using the first class bathroom could be a violation of the airline's policies. The FA's job is to enforce these rules, so she's doing her duty by pointing it out.\n\nThen there's the interaction part. The person interrupted the FA when she was lecturing, said \"thank you\" and walked away. The FA followed them and called them rude. The person argues that the lecture was unnecessary, but the FA was just doing her job. The person didn't handle the situation politely. Cutting someone off and walking away when they're trying to address you is considered rude in most contexts, even if you're stressed. The FA was doing her job, and the person's response could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the person might have a point if using the first class bathroom is allowed, but I don't think premier status automatically grants that. Premier status usually gives things like priority boarding, better seats, but not first class amenities. So the person might have been in the wrong for using the bathroom. Additionally, their reaction to the FA's correction was abrupt and dismissive, which is rude regardless.\n\nOn the other hand, the FA's tone was angry and loud enough for others to hear, which might have escalated the situation. But her job is to enforce rules, and if someone is violating them, she has to address it. The person's choice to walk away could be seen as not respecting her authority or the airline's policies.\n\nSo considering all that, the person might be in the wrong for both using the bathroom improperly and for the rude response. Alternatively, if the airline's rules are unclear, maybe the FA overstepped. But in most cases, using first class bathrooms as a non-first class passenger is against the rules, so the person is at fault. Also, walking away from an employee doing their job is considered rude. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
