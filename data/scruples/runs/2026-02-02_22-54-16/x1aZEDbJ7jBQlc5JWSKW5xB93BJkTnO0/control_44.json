I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the context: They frequently fly with this airline, have premier status, and are in a seat right behind first class. The flight attendant acted oddly, making strict rules and extra announcements. Before landing, there was a rush to the back bathrooms, but the first class bathroom was empty. The author used the first class bathroom, which they've done before without issues. The FA then confronts them, the author interrupts to say thanks and walks away, leading the FA to follow and call them rude.\n\nNow, the key points here. The main question is whether using the first class bathroom was against rules. If the airline allows premier status holders to use first class amenities, then it's not the author's fault. However, if the FA's rules changed that day, maybe there was a reason. But the author mentions they've done this before without problems, so maybe the FA was being inconsistent.\n\nNext, when confronted, the author didn't get angry but just said thanks and walked away. The FA followed and made a loud comment. The author's action of walking away might be seen as rude, but given the FA's aggressive lecture, maybe it's a self-defense move to avoid escalation.\n\nThe FA's job is to enforce rules, but they also need to handle situations professionally. If the author wasn't violating any policies, the FA's reaction is unwarranted. However, the author's act of walking away could be seen as disrespectful regardless.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If using the first class bathroom was allowed, then the FA overstepped. But walking away during a confrontation might still be rude. However, the FA's approach was loud and public, which escalated things. The author's response was to avoid further conflict, which is understandable. The FA's behavior might be the main issue here. So the answer might be B (Not the author's fault) because they followed their usual practice and the FA was being unreasonable.\n"
