I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using the first class bathroom even though they're in economy. The person says they're a frequent flyer with premier status, which probably gives them some perks, like choosing seats near first class. They used the first class bathroom because the economy one was busy, and then a flight attendant lectured them about it.\n\nFirst, are there any rules against using the first class bathroom if you're not in first class? Maybe the airline has specific policies. The author mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues, so maybe the rule isn't consistently enforced. But just because others didn't get caught doesn't mean it's allowed. The flight attendant was upset, so there's probably a rule against it.\n\nThe flight attendant followed the author and said it's rude to walk away. The author interrupted the lecture and left, then ignored further comments. Walking away when someone is talking to you is generally considered impolite, especially in a professional setting. Even if the author felt the lecture was unnecessary, cutting off the conversation and ignoring the attendant could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the flight attendant acted angrily and made a scene, which might have contributed to the author's decision to leave. The author's reason was having a long day and not wanting to deal with the lecture. But does that justify ignoring the attendant's instructions? Also, the flight attendant's behavior might be part of their job, enforcing rules, even if they're strict.\n\nSo the author did break a policy, even if it's not clearly communicated. Walking away and ignoring the attendant is rude, so they are at least partially in the wrong. The flight attendant's behavior might not be perfect, but the author's actions still have consequences. So the answer is A.\n"
