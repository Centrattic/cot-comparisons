I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're sitting in the row behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) reprimanded them for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Usually, first class amenities are for first class passengers. The author isn't in first class but has premier status. Maybe the airline allows such access for elite members. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. So maybe there's a policy that allows it, even if it's not explicitly stated.\n\nThe FA's reaction seems harsh. The author had a legitimate need (using the bathroom) and there was a long line in the regular section. The first class bathroom was available. The FA waited by the door, leading to a confrontation. The author left when being lectured, which the FA then called rude.\n\nBut the author's action of walking away when being lectured could be seen as disrespectful. Even if they believe they did nothing wrong, interrupting with a \"thank you\" and walking away might not be the best approach. The FA was doing their job, and dismissing them could be rude.\n\nHowever, the FA's behavior might have been excessive. If the airline allows premier status holders to use first class amenities, then the FA's lecture was unwarranted. Also, the author's reason for leaving was that they were tired and didn't want to hear the lecture. The FA followed and made a public comment, which might be more at fault.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe partially. They might not have followed a specific rule, but if the policy allows it, then the FA was incorrect. The author's response could have been more respectful. However, the FA's public shaming might be more to blame. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the author interrupted and walked away, maybe they are at least slightly in the wrong. But if the policy doesn't prohibit it, then the FA was wrong. The answer might hinge on the airline's actual policies. Since the user says the author has used it before without issues, the FA's action was inappropriate. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
