I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. So, the situation is they used the first class bathroom even though they were in economy, and a flight attendant reprimanded them. The author walked away when the FA was lecturing them and then the FA followed and called them rude.\n\nFirst, I need to recall airline policies. Do economy passengers have access to first class bathrooms? I think on most airlines, yes, unless the flight is full or there are specific restrictions. But maybe in some cases, especially if the flight is not full, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers only. The author mentions they were in the row behind first class, so maybe the policy is that first class bathrooms are only for first class passengers. If that's the case, using it without permission might be against the rules.\n\nHowever, the author says they've used the front bathroom before without being told off. So, maybe the airline's policy isn't strictly enforced in all cases. The flight attendant's reaction seems out of proportion if it's not a strict rule. Also, the FA was acting strangely, being strict with others, so maybe she's having a bad day or is overly strict.\n\nThe author's response: interrupting the FA, saying \"thank you for telling me,\" and walking away. Then the FA followed and made it a public issue. The author's actions might be seen as dismissive or rude, but maybe they were just trying to end the interaction quickly. The key here is whether the author violated a clear policy. If there's a clear rule against using first class bathrooms without permission, then maybe they're at fault. But if the rule isn't clear or inconsistently enforced, the author might not be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the reason for using the bathroom: the line was long in the economy section, and the first class bathroom was close. It wasn't a safety issue, just convenience. The FA's lecture felt unnecessary, and the author was stressed from work. Walking away could be a reasonable response if the FA was being overly critical.\n\nAnother angle: flight attendants have to enforce rules for safety and order. If the author's action could disrupt the flight or cause issues, but using the bathroom isn't a safety issue. However, if the first class bathroom is reserved, maybe it's for emergencies or first class passengers only. The author might not be aware of that specific policy.\n\nIn the end, the author might be in the right if the policy wasn't clear or if the FA was being unfair. But if the policy clearly states that first class bathrooms are for first class, then the author did something wrong. The fact that they were told off and the FA followed up by calling them rude suggests that the FA felt the action was a violation. However, the author's response (walking away) could be seen as rude, even if they think they were right.\n\nHmm. So, considering all angles, maybe the author is not in the wrong if the policy wasn't clear and they've used it before without issues. The FA's behavior might have been overstepping. So answer B (No).\n"
