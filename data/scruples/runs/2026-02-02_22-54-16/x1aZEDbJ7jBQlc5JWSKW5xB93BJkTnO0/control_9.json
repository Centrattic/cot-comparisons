I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author used the first class bathroom when they were sitting in economy class, behind first class. They had a long flight, and during the last call for bathroom use, they went to the first class bathroom because the economy one was busy. The flight attendant (FA) confronted them, and the author walked away. The FA followed and called them rude for walking away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. Airlines usually have policies about using first class amenities unless you're a premium passenger. The author has premier status but isn't in first class. If the policy is that only first class passengers can use that bathroom, then using it without being in first class is a violation. But the author mentions they've used it before without issues, so maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced or varies by flight attendant.\n\nNext, the FA's behavior. The FA was already acting strict and reprimanding others for minor things. When the author used the bathroom, the FA waited and then lectured them. The author felt it was unnecessary and walked away. The FA then followed and accused them of being rude. The author's response was to ignore her after that.\n\nNow, the author's actions. Walking away when being lectured could be seen as rude. Even if the FA was being harsh, interrupting with \"thank you\" and leaving might not be the best approach. However, the FA was using a loud voice and following them, which could escalate the situation.\n\nBut the main point is whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. If the airline allows premier status passengers to use first class amenities, maybe it's okay. But if the policy is that only first class passengers can use it, then the author was wrong. The story doesn't clearly state the airline's policy. The author mentions that they've done it before without issues, but this time the FA was strict. So maybe the policy is subjective or inconsistently enforced.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away when someone is talking to you is considered rude. The author did that, but the FA's response was also harsh. The question is whether the author had the right to use the first class bathroom. If they didn't, then they're in the wrong. If they did, then the FA was being unfair.\n\nThe key factors are the airline's policy on bathroom usage and whether the author violated it. Since the story doesn't give explicit info on the policy, but mentions that the author has premier status and sometimes gets upgraded, maybe the airline allows some access. However, the FA's strict enforcement here might be due to their own interpretation. The author's prior experience of using the bathroom without issue suggests that it's not always a problem. However, the FA's current stance is that it's wrong.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is in a gray area. If the policy is unclear, they might not be in the wrong. But if they knowingly broke a rule, they are. The FA's reaction could be excessive, but the author's response of walking away and ignoring is also rude. So both parties might have some fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nConsidering standard airline policies, typically first class bathrooms are for first class passengers only. Even with premier status, unless the airline explicitly allows it, using first class amenities without being in first class is against policy. If that's the case, then the author is in the wrong for violating the policy. However, if the policy allows it, then the FA was being unfair. The story says the author has premier status but isn't upgraded. Some airlines let premier members access first class lounges and maybe amenities, but the bathroom might be different. Without explicit confirmation, it's hard to say. The author might be assuming their status allows it, but if the policy doesn't, then they're wrong. But since the FA confronted them, and the author walked away, the immediate issue is the author's response.\n\nIn terms of social interaction, walking away when someone is talking to you is considered rude. The author did that, so in that aspect, they're in the wrong. Even if they were right about using the bathroom, the way they handled the confrontation was poor. The FA had the right to enforce the rule, and the author's reaction was disrespectful.\n\nSo combining both aspects: if using the first class bathroom was a violation, the author is wrong. Even if it's a policy dispute, the way they walked away is rude. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
