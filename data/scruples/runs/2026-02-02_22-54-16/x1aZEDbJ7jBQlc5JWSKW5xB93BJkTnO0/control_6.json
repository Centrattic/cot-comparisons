I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when they're seated in economy, which is behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) then lectures them about it, and the author walks away, leading to the FA following them and calling them rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The user mentions that they've used the first class bathroom before without issues, so maybe the policy is flexible. However, the FA's current stance might be different. Even if there's no explicit rule against it, the FA is enforcing a rule here, which the author might be ignoring. \n\nThen there's the interaction. The FA was already having a strict day, which could indicate they're having a rough time. The author, after using the bathroom, is confronted by the FA. The author interrupts to say thanks and walks away. The FA follows and raises their voice, which the author ignores. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author violate any rules? If the airline allows economy passengers to use first class bathrooms when available, then the author might be in the right. However, if the FA is enforcing a rule (even if inconsistently), the author might be wrong to ignore their instructions. \n\nAlso, the social aspect: walking away when someone is talking to you, especially in a service context, could be seen as rude. The FA is doing their job, even if their tone is harsh. The author's response of walking away and ignoring further comments might come off as dismissive and uncooperative. \n\nBut the author also mentions they had a long day and the FA's lecture felt unnecessary. They might feel justified in not engaging, especially if the FA is being overly strict. However, in a professional setting, even if the employee's behavior is questionable, the customer is expected to follow instructions unless there's a clear right to ignore them. \n\nSo, the author's actions: using the bathroom (possibly against policy, depending on the airline's rules), then walking away from a confrontation. The FA's actions: enforcing rules, even if in a loud manner. \n\nIf the airline's policy allows it, the author isn't in the wrong for using the bathroom. But if the FA was correct in their enforcement, then the author is in the wrong for ignoring their instructions. The author's walk away and ignoring the FA could be seen as rude, regardless of the situation. \n\nBut since the user says the FA's lecture felt like a bombardment and unnecessary, maybe the FA overstepped. However, the author's choice to walk away and ignore could still make them responsible for the rudeness. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a toss-up depending on the airline's policies. But without explicit rules against using first class bathrooms, the author might not be in the wrong. However, their reaction to the FA's lecture by walking away is where they might be in the wrong, as it's disrespectful to ignore someone while they're trying to communicate, even if the communication is harsh.\n"
