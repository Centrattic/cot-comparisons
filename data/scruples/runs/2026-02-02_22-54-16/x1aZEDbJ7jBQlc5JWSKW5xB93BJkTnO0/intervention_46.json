I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is seated just behind first class and uses the first class bathroom when there's a long line in the economy one. The flight attendant (FA) gets upset, follows them, and calls them rude after they walk away.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they felt the FA was being unnecessarily harsh. They mention that they've used the front bathroom before without issues, implying that maybe the FA's reaction was out of line. The author also points out that the FA was being strict with other passengers earlier, suggesting inconsistency in enforcement.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Using the first class bathroom when it's accessible might not be against any rules, especially if the airline allows it for passengers in certain seats. However, if there are specific regulations about bathroom usage that the author violated, that could change things. But the author says they've done it before without problems, so maybe there's no rule against it.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Did the author do something wrong by using the first class bathroom? 2) Was walking away after being lectured inappropriate?\n\nRegarding the first point, if the airline permits it, the author isn't in the wrong. Since the FA didn't mention a rule the author broke, maybe it's more about etiquette than rules. But if the FA's job is to enforce certain policies, the author might have overstepped by not complying with the FA's instructions.\n\nOn the second point, walking away when someone is talking to you can be seen as rude, regardless of the context. The FA was trying to communicate, and the author left, which could be perceived as dismissive. However, if the FA was being overly aggressive or unprofessional, the author's reaction might be justified.\n\nThe author mentions they had a long day and didn't want to listen to the lecture. That personal context might make their reaction understandable. But from the airline's perspective, the FA is doing their job, and the author's response could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nSo, if the author's action of using the bathroom wasn't against any rules, then they aren't wrong for doing that. The FA's reaction might be the issue. However, walking away from someone while they're talking, even if it's an employee, could still be considered rude. The FA's follow-up comments about rudeness might be valid in that sense.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the FA was being unprofessional or harsh in their lecture, the author's choice to disengage could be a reasonable self-preservation tactic. However, the FA might have a right to enforce policies, even if the author felt it was unnecessary.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong for using the bathroom if it's allowed, and walking away could be a reaction to the FA's poor behavior. However, the act of walking away itself is generally considered impolite, which could place some fault on the author. But if the FA was being unreasonable, the author's response is more about self-defense against an unwarranted lecture.\n"
