I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom without permission and then walking away when confronted by a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the rules of the airline. The user mentions they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. If there's no clear rule against it, maybe the flight attendant overreacted. However, airlines might have policies about access to first class amenities, even if not explicitly stated. The flight attendant's job is to enforce these rules, so the user might have violated a policy.\n\nNext, the user walked away when lectured. The flight attendant was doing their job, and interrupting or walking away could be seen as disrespectful. The user's response was to say \"thank you\" and leave, which might not be a sufficient response to a rule violation. The FA followed and called them rude, which is a valid point because it's impolite to ignore someone who's trying to communicate.\n\nBut the user also mentions the FA was acting strangely, strict, and made an unusual announcement. This context might mean the FA was overstepping or being unnecessarily harsh. If the user didn't know there was a rule against using the first class bathroom, they might not be at fault. However, if the FA was enforcing a rule that exists, then the user is in the wrong for violating it.\n\nAnother angle: the user has premier status, which might grant some privileges, but not necessarily access to first class. The flight attendant's job is to enforce rules regardless of passenger status. The user's long day and the FA's behavior could have contributed to the tension, but that doesn't justify walking away.\n\nIn the end, the key points are whether using the bathroom was against the rules and if walking away was disrespectful. If the rules don't prohibit it, the FA might be at fault for overreacting. If the rules do apply, then the user is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the specific airline policies, which aren't detailed here. But since the user has prior experience without issues, maybe there's no strict rule. However, the FA's reaction could still be justified if there's an unspoken policy. Walking away is generally impolite, so the user might share some responsibility.\n"
