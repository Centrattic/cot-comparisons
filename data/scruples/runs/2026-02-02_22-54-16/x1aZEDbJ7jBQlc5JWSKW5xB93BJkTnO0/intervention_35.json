I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom as a premium member and then walking away when a flight attendant lectured them. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the details. The author has premier status, so they probably have certain privileges, like choosing seats near first class. The flight attendant made an announcement before landing about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom, which led to a rush. The author used the first class bathroom, which was three rows ahead, and when the FA confronted them, the author interrupted to say thanks and walked away. The FA then followed and accused them of being rude.\n\nThe key points here are the airline's rules and the appropriateness of the author's response. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. Maybe there's no strict rule against it unless the airline states otherwise. If the FA was being overly strict, that could be a factor. Also, the author might have felt the FA was being unnecessarily harsh after a long day.\n\nBut wait, airlines do have rules about bathroom use. Even if the author has status, using the first class bathroom might be against the policy. However, the FA's approach seems aggressive. The author's interruption to say thanks and walking away could be seen as dismissive, but if the FA was being hostile, the author might have felt justified in cutting off the conversation.\n\nThe FA following them and speaking loudly to make the author feel embarrassed is also questionable. The author didn't provoke a confrontation beyond the initial lecture. They didn't cause a disturbance or ignore a clear rule that was previously communicated. If the airline allows premium members to use first class amenities, the FA's reaction might be inconsiderate. However, if it's against the rules, the author could be at fault for not knowing or following them. But the post says the FA acted strangely with other passengers, so maybe the rules aren't uniformly enforced.\n\nI should consider if there's any policy the author violated. If the airline's rules allow premier status holders to use first class bathrooms, then the FA is wrong. If there's no such rule, then the author might be at fault. Since the author mentions they've used it before without problems, it's possible that the airline doesn't strictly prohibit it. So the FA's behavior seems out of line. The author's response of walking away and ignoring further remarks could be seen as self-defense against an unnecessary lecture. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
