I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom and then walking away when lectured by a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, often seated behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The author used the first class bathroom, which had no line, and then the FA confronted them. The author walked away, leading to the FA calling them rude.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the author do something wrong by using the first class bathroom? Well, maybe there are rules about which passengers can use which facilities. The author mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues, but maybe this time there was a specific policy they violated. Also, when the FA approached, the author interrupted to say thanks and walked away, which the FA found rude. \n\nThe FA followed and continued the lecture, and the author ignored her. Walking away from someone who's talking to you could be seen as impolite, regardless of the situation. Even if the author felt the lecture was unnecessary, walking away might not be the best response. However, the FA's behavior was also questionable\u2014if she was being overly strict and making a scene, maybe the author felt justified.\n\nBut in professional settings, you're supposed to handle conflicts calmly. The author's action of walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as dismissive. However, the FA's public shaming might have escalated things. \n\nI need to check if using the first class bathroom is against the rules. If the airline allows premium passengers to use first class amenities, then the author might not be at fault. But if the author is not in first class, maybe there's a policy against it. The author says they've done it before without issues, so maybe the policy isn't enforced consistently. \n\nIn terms of walking away, interrupting the FA and then leaving could be rude. The FA was doing her job, so the author should have listened politely, even if they disagreed. The FA's follow-up comment about rudeness in front of others was unprofessional too, but that doesn't excuse the author's response.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as a bit inconsiderate, but the FA's handling was also poor. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards the author being slightly at fault for walking away during a work-related confrontation, even if the FA was overreacting.\n"
