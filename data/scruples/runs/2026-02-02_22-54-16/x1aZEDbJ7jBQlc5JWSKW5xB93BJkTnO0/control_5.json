I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is at fault. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they're in premium economy or similar, and then walking away when a flight attendant lectures them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The user mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. But maybe there are specific policies about which bathrooms passengers can use based on their class. If the flight attendant is enforcing a rule, even if it's not clearly communicated, the passenger might be expected to follow it. However, if the rule isn't consistently enforced, that's a different issue.\n\nThe user's action: entering first class bathroom despite not being in first class. If the airline allows this, the FA's reaction is questionable. But if it's against policy, the user might be wrong. The FA's approach is described as angry and a lecture, which could be unprofessional. The user's response was to walk away, which the FA found rude. But given the long line and the convenience, maybe the user's action is understandable.\n\nThe user's defense is that they've done this before without issues. Maybe the policy is not strict, or the FA was overzealous that day. The user's main point is that the lecture was unnecessary and they were stressed from work. The key question is whether using the bathroom in first class is allowed. If it's allowed, then the FA was wrong. If not, the user is at fault.\n\nBut in many airlines, unless you're in first class, you might not be allowed to use their facilities. The user is in a seat behind first class, so maybe the bathroom is accessible. However, if the airline's policy is that only first class passengers can use that bathroom, then the user is violating a rule. But if it's a shared space, then the FA's enforcement is problematic.\n\nAlso, the FA's behavior is an issue. Yelling and following the passenger to reprimand them for a minor infraction could be considered rude. The user's reaction of walking away might be a reasonable defense against an over-the-top reaction. The user's action (using the bathroom) might be a minor infraction, but the FA's approach was unprofessional. So the blame might be shared.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the user broke a rule, even a minor one, they are at fault. If there's no rule against it, then the FA is wrong. The user's experience is that they've done it before, so maybe the airline doesn't enforce it. However, the FA is acting in her role to enforce rules. The user's decision to walk away after being confronted is where the conflict arises. Walking away might be seen as rude, but if the FA was being unprofessional, it's a mutual issue.\n\nI think the key is whether using the first class bathroom is against the rules. If it is, the user is wrong. If not, the FA is. But since the user mentions they're in a seat behind first class, maybe the bathroom is accessible to all passengers. However, in some cases, first class bathrooms are exclusive. Without knowing the specific airline's policy, it's hard, but typically, first class amenities are for first class passengers only. So the user might be in the wrong for using it. Then, walking away is also rude. So the answer might be A, yes the user is wrong. But if the user's action was allowed, then B. But since the FA was following them and being loud, maybe the user's action is justified. Hmm. This is tricky. I need to balance both sides. The user's action might be a minor rule violation, but their response was also defensive. The FA's behavior was likely worse. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong. But if the rule is clear, then the user is. Since the user has used it before, maybe the rule is flexible. Therefore, the answer could be B.\n"
