I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a flight attendant lecturing them for using the first class bathroom when they're seated in business or economy class, but behind first class. The author then walks away, and the FA follows and calls them rude.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the rules regarding bathroom usage. The airline's policy probably states that premium class passengers can use their own bathrooms, but non-premium class passengers are restricted. The author is in a seat behind first class, which might be part of the economy or business class. If the flight attendant's role is to enforce these policies, then using the first class bathroom without entitlement could be a violation. However, the author mentions they have premier status and sometimes get upgraded, but in this case, they weren't in first class. So maybe the policy allows premier status holders to use first class amenities, but that might not be the case. I should check typical airline policies. Usually, even if you have a status, you can't use first class bathrooms unless you're in first class. So the author might be in the wrong for using it.\n\nThen, the flight attendant made an announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom before landing. The author used the first class bathroom after that, leading to a confrontation. The FA then followed the author and called them rude when they walked away. The author's defense is that they've done this before without issues and that the FA was being overly strict. But if the policy is clear, then the FA is just doing her job, and the author's interruption and walking away could be seen as disrespectful. The FA's loud comment might have been a way to address the situation publicly, but that's part of her role too.\n\nSo the main points are: Did the author violate the airline's rules by using the first class bathroom? If yes, then the FA is right to enforce that. The author's reaction of walking away and ignoring the FA is impolite, even if they felt the lecture was unnecessary. The FA's job is to ensure compliance, so the author is in the wrong for both using the bathroom improperly and for being rude in response. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
