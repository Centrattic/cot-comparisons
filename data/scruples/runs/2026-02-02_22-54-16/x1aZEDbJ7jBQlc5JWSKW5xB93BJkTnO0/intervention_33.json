I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom without being a first class passenger and then walking away when reprimanded by a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Many airlines allow non-first class passengers to use the first class bathroom if it's accessible and they aren't being disruptive. The writer mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues, which suggests the airline doesn't strictly enforce that rule in this case. So, maybe the flight attendant was being overly strict this time.\n\nNext, the context of the flight attendant's behavior. The writer states that the FA was acting oddly, strict with rules, and made unnecessary announcements. This could indicate that the FA was having a bad day or was overcompensating. The writer's decision to use the first class bathroom was likely out of necessity due to the long line, which is understandable. However, the timing\u2014before landing\u2014might be a safety rule, so the FA's concern could be valid for safety reasons.\n\nThen there's the interaction itself. The writer interrupts the FA's lecture with a polite \"thank you\" and walks away. The FA follows and criticizes them for walking away. The writer's reaction is based on their long day and not wanting to engage. The FA's loud comment in public might have been unprofessional, but the writer's initial response was to disengage, which could be seen as rude.\n\nConsidering all factors: the airline's policy, the FA's behavior, the writer's intent, and the safety aspect. If the policy doesn't prohibit non-first class use, the writer isn't wrong. But if there's a rule about using only the assigned bathroom, even for a brief period, then the writer might be at fault. However, since they've done it before without issues, the inconsistency in enforcement might play a role. The main issue is whether walking away was rude. In a professional setting, it's usually better to address concerns directly. The writer chose not to engage, which could be seen as disrespectful. So there's a split here. But given that the FA was being overly strict and the writer's action was a response to that, maybe the writer isn't in the wrong.\n"
