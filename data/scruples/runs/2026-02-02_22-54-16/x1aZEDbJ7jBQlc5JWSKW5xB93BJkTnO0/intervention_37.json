I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when they're seated in business or economy class, right behind first. The flight attendant (FA) gets upset and lectures them, leading the author to walk away and ignore further comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline regulations. Do airlines have specific rules about bathroom usage for different classes? I think some allow all passengers to use any bathroom, but others might restrict it. The author mentions they've used the first class bathroom before without issues. If the airline's policy permits it, then the FA's reaction might be unwarranted. However, if there's a rule against it, the author is technically in the wrong.\n\nNext, the FA's behavior. She was already strict with passengers, making extra announcements, and being stringent about rules. The author tried to use the bathroom during a time when there was a long line in the back but not in first. The author's action might have been reasonable to avoid long waits, especially if the policy allows it. But the FA's reaction\u2014following them and yelling in public\u2014could be excessive.\n\nThen there's the author's response. They interrupted the FA's lecture by thanking her and walking away. The FA then accused them of being rude. The author's choice to walk away might be seen as dismissive, but if they felt the lecture was unnecessary, they might have a point. However, walking away while someone is speaking could be considered impolite regardless.\n\nThe user argues the author isn't in the wrong. Their reasoning includes the inconsistency of the FA's reaction (since others used the bathroom before without issues) and the FA's already difficult attitude. They also mention the FA's job is hard, but the author didn't mean to make it harder.\n\nSo, if the airline's policy allows using any bathroom, then the author did nothing wrong. The FA's harsh response might be the issue here. But if there's a rule against it, even if not enforced before, the author could be at fault. However, the inconsistency in enforcement (others using it before without issues) might mitigate that. Additionally, the FA's behavior seems over the top, which could shift blame towards her rather than the author.\n\nAnother angle is the timing. The FA's announcement about using the bathroom before landing might imply that using the bathroom is necessary, but the author's choice to use the nearest one is practical. The FA waiting by the door suggests she was determined to reprimand, which might not be professional.\n\nIn conclusion, if the airline allows it, the author is not in the wrong. If there's a rule, maybe the author is partially at fault, but the FA's excessive reaction could absolve them. The key is whether the airline's policy is clear. Since the user states the author has used it before without issues, the policy likely allows it, making the author not in the wrong.\n"
