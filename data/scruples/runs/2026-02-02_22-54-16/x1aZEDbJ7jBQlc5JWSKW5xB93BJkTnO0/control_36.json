I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant who was lecturing them about using the first class bathroom.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person uses the first class bathroom even though they're not in first class. The flight attendant confronts them, the author walks away, and then the FA follows and calls them rude. The author argues that they've done this before without issues and that the FA was being overly strict.\n\nSo, the key points here. Airline policies: Is using the first class bathroom without being a first class passenger against the rules? I think most airlines do have policies that restrict first class amenities to those passengers. So the author might have violated the policy. But maybe the enforcement is inconsistent. The author mentions they've done it before without being reprimanded, which could indicate that the policy isn't always enforced strictly. However, the flight attendant in this case chose to enforce it.\n\nThen there's the interaction. The author interrupts the FA's lecture to say \"thank you\" and walks away. The FA then follows and criticizes them for walking away. The author's action of walking away could be seen as dismissive, but given the context of a long day and a stressful situation, maybe it's understandable. But in a professional setting, especially in a confined space like an airplane, how one handles conflict matters. The FA's job is to maintain order and safety, so the author's response might come off as disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the author's status as a premier customer. They have perks like choosing seats near first class. Maybe the airline expects a certain level of etiquette from their frequent flyers. Even if the policy isn't enforced every time, the author's actions could be seen as abusing their privilege by using first class facilities without paying for it.\n\nBut the FA's approach might have been harsh. Instead of a lecture, maybe a simple correction would suffice. However, the author's response of walking away and ignoring the FA could be seen as uncooperative. The FA is within their rights to remind passengers of policies, but the way they did it might have been unprofessional too.\n\nSo weighing it all: The author likely violated an airline policy by using the first class bathroom. However, the FA's handling of the situation might have been overly aggressive. The author's decision to walk away could be seen as disrespectful, but considering the FA's tone and the author's history of not being reprimanded before, there's a case for both sides. But in the grand scheme, the author's action of using the wrong bathroom is the initial issue. Even if others do it, it's not excusing the behavior. The FA has a duty to enforce rules, but the author had a choice to comply or at least handle the confrontation with more respect. So, the author might be in the wrong for both using the bathroom improperly and then walking away dismissively. But maybe the FA overreacted. The key is whether the author's actions were a clear policy violation. If the policy is strict, then yes, the author is at fault. If the policy is flexible, maybe not. But most airlines have clear guidelines, so the author probably is in the wrong.\n"
