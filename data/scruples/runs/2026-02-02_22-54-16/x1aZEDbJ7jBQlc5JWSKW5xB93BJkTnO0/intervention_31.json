I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom when a flight attendant reprimanded them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, sitting just behind first class. The flight attendant made an unusual announcement about using the bathroom or stowing luggage before landing. The author used the first class bathroom, which was accessible and not busy, and when confronted, walked away. The FA followed and criticized them for being rude.\n\nThe key points here are: the author had a valid reason (need to use the bathroom) and there was no line in first class. They had used it before without issues. The FA's behavior seems excessive\u2014yelling and chasing them. The author's response was to disengage, which they felt was justified after a long day.\n\nNow, considering airline policies. Sometimes, first class amenities are reserved for first class passengers. But the author's seat is right behind first class, which might give access under certain conditions. If the airline allows it, then the author is fine. If not, they might be in the wrong. However, since they've done it before without problems, maybe the policy isn't enforced strictly here.\n\nAlso, the FA's approach is questionable. Telling someone to use the wrong bathroom and then lecturing them could be unprofessional. The author's choice to walk away might be a reasonable self-defense against harassment, especially if the FA was escalating the situation.\n\nThe author's response of \"thank you\" and walking away isn't rude in itself. The FA's loud criticism in public is unprofessional. The author didn't engage further, which could be smart to avoid conflict.\n\nSo, the author likely isn't in the wrong. The FA's actions were more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
