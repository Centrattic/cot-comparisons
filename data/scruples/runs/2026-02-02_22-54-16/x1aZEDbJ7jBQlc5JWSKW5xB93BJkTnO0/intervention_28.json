I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom without permission and then walking away when confronted by a flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, seated behind first class. During a flight, after an announcement to use the bathroom, they used the first class bathroom. The flight attendant (FA) then lectured them, and the author walked away, leading to the FA following and calling them rude.\n\nThe author argues that they've done this before without issues, so they felt it was acceptable. The FA's behavior seems strict and possibly inconsistent. The author felt it was a long day and didn't want to engage in a lecture, hence walking away.\n\nNow, considering airline policies. Typically, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers only. Using them without permission could be against the rules, even if the attendant didn't enforce it before. The author might have violated a policy, which the FA is now enforcing. However, if the policy isn't clearly communicated, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault.\n\nThen there's the response to the FA. The author interrupted the lecture, said \"thank you,\" and walked away. The FA followed and raised her voice. The author's actions could be seen as dismissive or rude, especially in a professional setting. While they might not have broken a major rule, their reaction to the FA's feedback could be considered inconsiderate.\n\nBut the FA's approach might also be a factor. If she escalated the situation unnecessarily, her behavior could be at fault too. The author might have felt targeted, especially if others used the front bathroom without issue. However, the author's responsibility is to follow posted rules, regardless of others' actions.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away when someone is speaking to you is generally considered rude. Even if the FA was being harsh, the author's choice to ignore her and walk away might have exacerbated the situation. The FA's loud statement in front of others could be part of the problem, but the author's initial action of using the first class bathroom without permission is a key point.\n\nSo, balancing the policy violation against the response. The author likely broke a rule by using the first class bathroom, which could make them at least partially responsible. However, the FA's handling of the situation might have been harsh, leading to the conflict. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong despite the FA's possible overreaction.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often debate both sides. Here, the author might be in the wrong for using the bathroom improperly, but also the FA for her public confrontation. However, the author's refusal to engage after being told might be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they violated a policy, but there's nuance in how the FA handled it. Alternatively, if the policy wasn't clear, maybe not. But generally, airlines have strict rules about lounge and bathroom access, so using first class facilities without being a first class passenger is a rule breach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for that action, but the FA's response was also inappropriate. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing.\n"
