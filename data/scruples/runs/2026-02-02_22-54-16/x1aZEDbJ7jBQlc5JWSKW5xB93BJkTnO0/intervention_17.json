I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after using the first class bathroom. The situation is that the author was in a seat behind first class, and there was a long line for the regular bathroom but none for first class. The author used the first class bathroom, then when the FA reprimanded them, they walked away and the FA followed, calling them rude.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the rules about bathroom usage on airplanes. First class bathrooms are usually reserved for first class passengers and those in business or premium economy, depending on the airline's policies. But the user mentions that they've used the first class bathroom before without issue. So maybe the airline's policy isn't strictly enforced in their experience.\n\nThe author was in an economy seat but in a row that's often close to first class. The flight attendant was strict and made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The line for the regular bathroom was long, so the author used the first class one. The FA then confronted them, leading to the argument.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the airline's rules. If the policy allows economy passengers to use first class bathrooms when necessary, then the FA might be overstepping. But if the policy strictly prohibits it, the author might have done something they shouldn't. However, the user mentions that in the past, no FA said anything, so maybe the policy isn't consistently enforced.\n\nAlso, the FA's reaction seems harsh. She waited for the author, lectured them, then followed them to call them rude. The author felt it was unnecessary and a bombardment. The author's response was to walk away after a long day, which might be understandable stress. But interrupting with \"thank you for telling me\" and walking away could come off as dismissive. However, in a high-stress situation, that might be a reasonable self-preservation tactic.\n\nOn the other hand, the FA's job is to enforce rules for safety and order. If the bathroom is for first class only, the author's use could cause issues with first class passengers. But if the line was long and the first class bathroom was empty, maybe the author's action was pragmatic.\n\nSo, considering the author's intent wasn't malicious, the FA's reaction was excessive, and the previous lack of enforcement, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
