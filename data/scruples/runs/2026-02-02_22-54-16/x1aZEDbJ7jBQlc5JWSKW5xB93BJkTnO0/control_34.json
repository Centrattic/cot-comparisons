I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here.\n\nSo, the situation is that the person used the first class bathroom even though they're in economy class, right behind first class. The flight attendant (FA) was already acting a bit strict and made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The person went to the first class bathroom because there was a long line in the economy one, and the FA got angry. The person walked away when the FA started lecturing them and then was called out for being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to check if using the first class bathroom is allowed. I think on most airlines, first class bathrooms are for first class passengers only. If the person is in economy, they might be in the wrong by using the first class bathroom. Even if they didn't know the rules, it's still probably against the policy. So the FA has a point there.\n\nThen, when the FA approached the person, the person didn't listen and walked away. The FA followed and yelled about being rude. The person's response was \"thank you for telling me,\" which might be seen as dismissive. Cutting off a conversation, especially when being corrected, could come off as rude. Even if the person was tired, interrupting and walking away might not be the best response. The FA was doing their job, so the person's reaction could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the FA's behavior might have been excessive. If the person has done this before without issues, the FA's reaction could be out of line. Also, if the flight attendant was already being strict about other minor things, their reaction here might be part of a pattern of over-enforcing rules, which the user mentioned.\n\nBut the main question is whether the person is in the wrong. Using the wrong bathroom is a rule violation. Disregarding the FA's instructions and walking away is also against protocol. Even if the FA was being harsh, the person's actions are still technically against the rules. So the answer would be A (the person is in the wrong) because they broke a policy and didn't respond appropriately when confronted. The FA's behavior might not be great, but the person's actions were also incorrect.\n"
