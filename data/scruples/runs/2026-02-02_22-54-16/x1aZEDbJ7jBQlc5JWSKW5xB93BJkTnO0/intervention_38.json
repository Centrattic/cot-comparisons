I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for walking away from a flight attendant after being lectured.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person used the first class bathroom, which was closer, even though they were in economy. The flight attendant was strict and made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The writer then went to the first class bathroom, which they've done before without issues. When confronted by the flight attendant, they interrupted the lecture, said \"thank you,\" and walked away. The FA followed them, called them rude, and the writer ignored her.\n\nNow, considering the rules. Airline regulations about bathroom use usually depend on the flight class. If the person is in economy, using first class amenities might be against the rules. However, the writer mentions they've used the front bathroom before without being reprimanded. This suggests that maybe the airline allows it, or the FAs aren't strictly enforcing it. \n\nThe flight attendant's reaction seems excessive. The writer didn't disrupt anything; they were just using the bathroom. The FA waited for them, then lectured them during a time-sensitive situation (before landing). The writer's response was to walk away, which could be seen as a reasonable way to avoid confrontation, especially after a long day. \n\nThe FA's follow-up, shouting in a public space, might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The writer's action of walking away could be justified as not engaging in an argument. But technically, if there's a rule against using first class facilities as an economy passenger, the writer might be at fault. However, the inconsistency in enforcement (others using it before) complicates that. \n\nAlso, the writer's status as a frequent flyer with premier status might give them some leeway, but that's not a rule. The main issue is whether using the first class bathroom is against the rules. If it is, the writer broke a rule. If not, they didn't. The ambiguity here is key. Since the writer has done it before without issues, maybe it's not against the rules. The flight attendant's strictness could be due to personal reasons rather than a strict policy. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, walking away when someone is talking might be considered rude. However, the writer was being lectured by someone who was already being strict and reprimanding others for minor things. The writer's response might be seen as a way to de-escalate. \n\nSo, if using first class facilities is against the rules, then the writer is in the wrong. But if it's allowed, then the FA overreacted. Since the writer's past experience shows it's allowed, maybe they're not in the wrong. The key is the airline's policy, which isn't specified here. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation given. \n\nGiven that the writer didn't cause any harm and the FA's response seems harsh, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). The writer's action of walking away to avoid further confrontation is understandable, especially after the FA's previous behavior towards other passengers.\n"
