I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom as a non-first class passenger and then walking away when a flight attendant lectured them about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The author mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without any issues. That suggests maybe the policy is flexible or not strictly enforced. But maybe there's a rule against non-first class passengers using that bathroom, even if it's not always enforced. The flight attendant's reaction could be based on a policy they're supposed to follow, even if others didn't get caught before.\n\nThen there's the context of the flight. The author is in a row behind first class, which might mean the first class bathroom is technically accessible to them. The flight attendant's behavior seems harsh\u2014being \"angrily\" and making a public reprimand. The author had a long day and didn't want to engage, which is understandable. Walking away when someone is lecturing you could be seen as rude, but the alternative is to listen to a potentially lengthy lecture that might not be justified.\n\nAlso, the flight attendant followed the author to their seat and made a comment about rudeness in front of others. That escalation might be partly the flight attendant's fault for making it public. The author's action of walking away to avoid confrontation could be a reasonable response, especially if they felt the lecture was unnecessary.\n\nI should consider both sides. The flight attendant might be enforcing a policy, even if inconsistently. The author might be following common practice but got caught this time. However, the way the flight attendant handled it was unprofessional, and the author's response was to disengage, which is a valid self-preservation tactic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author is not in the wrong because the policy might not be clearly communicated, and the flight attendant's response was overly aggressive. The author also had a valid reason to avoid engaging further given the stressful situation.\n"
