I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom and then walking away when a flight attendant reprimanded them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, which gives them certain privileges. They were seated behind first class. Before landing, there was an announcement about stowing bags and using the bathroom, which caused a rush. The first class bathroom was empty, so the author used it. The flight attendant was waiting for them outside and lectured them. The author interrupted with a thank you and walked away, leading the FA to follow and call them rude.\n\nNow, considering airline rules. Do passengers have access to first class bathrooms if they're seated behind first class? If the author is in a seat that's adjacent to first class, maybe it's allowed. But if the flight attendant says otherwise, there might be a rule against it. The author mentions they've used it before without issues, so maybe the policy isn't consistently enforced.\n\nThe flight attendant's behavior seems strict. She was already acting oddly, enforcing rules strictly. The author might not have known the bathroom was off-limits, especially if they've used it before. The key points are whether using the bathroom was against policy and how the author responded when confronted.\n\nThe author's response was to walk away when lectured. They were having a hard day and didn't want to engage. But walking away while being lectured by an authority figure could be seen as disrespectful. However, if the FA overstepped with a lecture, the author might have a point. The FA's loud comment in front of others could have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the policy. If using the first class bathroom was against the rules, then the author did something wrong, but if it's allowed, then the FA was being strict. The response of walking away might be seen as rude, but the FA's actions were also problematic. The author might not be entirely at fault if the policy isn't clear or consistently applied. However, the act of ignoring the FA and walking away could be considered disrespectful regardless. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because the FA's behavior was unprofessional. But there's a nuance. The author might have violated a policy, but the FA's reaction was excessive. However, the author's response of walking away could be seen as rude. It's a bit of a gray area. But since the user believes the author isn't wrong, and the FA was overreacting, the answer would be B.\n"
