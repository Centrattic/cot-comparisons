I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when they were seated in economy class, right behind first. The flight attendant got upset and followed them to lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Usually, airlines have specific rules about bathroom usage. First class bathrooms are typically for first class passengers, but sometimes economy passengers can use them if available, especially if there's a long line in their own section. The poster mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues, which suggests that maybe it's allowed under certain circumstances. However, the flight attendant in this case was strict and reprimanded them. \n\nThe key points are: the flight attendant was being unusually strict, there was a long line in economy, and the first class bathroom was empty. The author didn't cause a disturbance but was trying to get to the bathroom urgently. When confronted, they interrupted the FA to thank her and walked away, which the FA followed up with a public reprimand.\n\nNow, considering the rules vs. common practice. If the airline's policy strictly prohibits economy passengers from using first class bathrooms, then the author is in the wrong. But if it's something that's generally allowed when available, then the FA overreacted. The author also points out that they've done this before without problems. \n\nThe FA's behavior seems to be the main issue here. She was already strict with other passengers, made an unusual announcement, and then followed the author to publicly shame them. The author's response\u2014interrupting to say thanks and walking away\u2014could be seen as a polite way to end the interaction, especially after a long day. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away from someone who's lecturing you can be rude, but if the person is being unreasonable or the lecture is unnecessary, it's a way to de-escalate. The FA's public follow-up might be more about maintaining authority than a justified concern. \n\nSo, the author's actions don't seem malicious. They tried to use a less crowded bathroom and were reprimanded unnecessarily. The FA's overreaction and the context of her being strict with others might mean the author isn't entirely at fault. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
