I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is at fault. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person used the first class bathroom even though they're in economy, behind first class. They had a flight attendant who was already strict and made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The person went to the first class bathroom because there was a line in economy. The FA confronted them, the person interrupted and walked away, then ignored her when she followed and said they were rude. \n\nSo, the key points are about airline policies on bathroom usage. Are passengers allowed to use first class bathrooms if they're in economy? From what I know, airlines typically have rules that passengers should use the bathrooms designated for their class. First class bathrooms are for first class passengers unless there's an overflow or specific permission.\n\nThe person mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. Maybe the airline's policy allows it under certain circumstances, like when there's a long line. However, in this case, the FA was strict and made an announcement, which might have been to prevent delays during landing. The person's action could be against the policy, leading to the FA's reaction.\n\nThen, when confronted, the person walked away and ignored the FA. Even if the policy is unclear, the appropriate response would be to comply or ask for clarification. Walking away and ignoring an employee's instruction, especially in a professional setting, could be seen as rude or disrespectful. The FA might have been enforcing rules to ensure safety and order, so the person's reaction might have been uncooperative.\n\nBut the user also mentions the FA was acting bizarrely, strict with rules, and made extra announcements. This context might suggest the FA was being overly harsh. However, regardless of the FA's demeanor, the passenger's duty is to follow the rules and engage politely. Disrespecting the staff, even if they're being difficult, isn't acceptable.\n\nSo, the person might be at fault for both using the wrong bathroom (if against policy) and for the rude response. However, if the airline allows using first class bathrooms when necessary, then the FA's reaction was unwarranted. But since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, the answer hinges on policy and proper behavior towards staff.\n\nGiven that the person interrupted the FA and walked away, then ignored her, they likely breached proper conduct. Even if they thought they were right, the way they responded was disrespectful. So, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
