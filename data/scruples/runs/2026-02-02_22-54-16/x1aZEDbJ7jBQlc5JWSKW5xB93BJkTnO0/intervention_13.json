I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom as a premier member and being lectured by a flight attendant, then walking away.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, which gives them priority seating, but they're in the row behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about stowing carry-ons and using the bathroom before landing. There was a long line in the economy class bathrooms, and the first class bathroom was empty. So the author used it, which is understandable since they're a priority passenger. When they came out, the FA was there and gave them a lecture. The author, tired from a long day, interrupted and said thanks before walking away. The FA followed and called them rude for not listening.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider the rules and the FA's job. Airlines do have policies about which bathrooms passengers can use. Even though the author is a premier member, maybe they're not allowed to use first class bathrooms unless upgraded. The FA's role is to enforce these rules, so if using the wrong bathroom is against the policy, the author might be at fault. However, the FA's approach seems harsh, especially since the author had used the front bathroom before without issues. The FA's behavior\u2014following them and speaking loudly\u2014could be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author actually violated a rule. If the policy allows premier members to use first class amenities, then the FA is being inconsistent. On the other hand, if the policy explicitly states that only first class passengers can use their bathrooms, then the author is in the wrong. The story mentions the author is in the row behind first class, which might be considered part of the first class area, so maybe the bathroom is accessible. Also, the user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, so I need to check if that aligns with the facts.\n\nIn many airlines, seats behind first class (like premium economy or business) might have access to first class amenities, but it's not universal. The author's status might grant them certain privileges. The FA's behavior seems unprofessional\u2014making unnecessary announcements, being overly strict, then following and lecturing in public. The author's interruption and walking away could be justified as they were not in the mood for a lecture, especially given the FA's prior behavior towards other passengers.\n\nHowever, the author did use a bathroom they might not have been allowed to. If the policy is clear, then the author could be in the wrong for breaking it. But if the policy is flexible or the FA is being inconsistent, then it's the FA's fault. The story says \"the airline not always know for the friendliest customer service,\" which might imply that the FA's strictness is unusual, but maybe that's part of the airline's norm. \n\nIn the end, the author might have a valid point about the FA's harsh treatment, but if using the wrong bathroom is against the rules, they might still be in the wrong. The answer depends on the specific airline's policies. Since the author didn't mention upgrading, and the FA was waiting for them, it's possible that the rule was broken. But the FA's response was also unprofessional. However, the question is about the author's actions, so if they did something against the airline's rules, even if the FA was being unreasonable, they are in the wrong. If the rules don't prohibit it, then the FA is at fault. The story doesn't clarify the policies, but the author's experience of using the front bathroom before without issues suggests that maybe it's allowed, and the FA was being overly strict. \n\nSo, considering that, the author might not be in the wrong. They acted based on prior experience and the situation (long line, empty first class bathroom). The FA's behavior was more unprofessional. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
