I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the first class bathroom and then walking away from a flight attendant's lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider airline policies. Some airlines do allow premium passengers or those in certain seats to use first class bathrooms, even if they're not in first class. The author has premier status and sits near first class, so maybe it's common for them to use that bathroom. The fact that they've done it before without issues suggests the airline might not have a strict policy against it in this case.\n\nThen, the flight attendant's reaction. The author mentions the FA was already being strict with other passengers. The timing was after the announcement, when people were rushing. The line for the regular bathroom was long, but the first class bathroom was empty. So the author's action was probably out of necessity and convenience, not malice.\n\nWhen confronted, the author responded politely (\"thank you for telling me\") and walked away. The FA followed and raised her voice, making a scene. The author didn't engage further, which is a reasonable response to an inappropriate confrontation. The FA's behavior might be unprofessional, especially if she's making a public spectacle.\n\nThe key points are whether the author violated any rules. If using the first class bathroom wasn't prohibited, then the author isn't at fault. Also, walking away from a lecture isn't rude if the person is being confrontational. The FA's follow-up was unprofessional, which shifts the blame towards her, not the author.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason, used the bathroom appropriately in the past, and handled the confrontation calmly.\n"
