I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, so they're probably used to certain perks. They were in a seat behind first class and used the first class bathroom when there was a long line in economy. The flight attendant was strict and made an announcement, which caused a rush. The author used the first class bathroom, which they've done before without issues. The FA confronted them, the author interrupted to say thanks and walked away, then ignored her when she followed.\n\nFirst, the rules about bathroom usage. If the airline allows premier status holders to use first class facilities, then the author is within their rights. The FA's reaction might be due to specific policies, but if the author has done this before without a problem, maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced. But maybe there's a rule against non-first class passengers using those bathrooms. The author isn't sure, so they might be in a gray area here.\n\nThen there's the interaction. The FA was clearly upset, and the author, after a long day, chose to walk away. The FA followed and called them rude. The user's question is whether the author was in the wrong. The key points are: Did the author break a rule? If not, was walking away a reasonable response to a perceived lecture? The author didn't engage further, which could be seen as rude, but if they felt harassed, walking away might be understandable.\n\nConsidering the FA's behavior\u2014being overly strict and making a scene\u2014the author might have felt they were being unfairly targeted. However, ignoring someone who is speaking to you, even if you disagree, can be seen as disrespectful. But the FA was following and continuing the lecture in a public way, which could be unprofessional.\n\nIn the end, if the author didn't violate any rules, they're not in the wrong. If they did, then maybe they are. But given that they've done it before without issues, it's more likely a policy that's not consistently enforced. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
