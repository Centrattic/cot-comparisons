I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the first class bathroom and then walking away after being lectured by the flight attendant.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a frequent flyer with premier status, so they have a higher-level of service. The flight attendant was already acting strict with other passengers. The author used the first class bathroom, which was empty at the time, but the FA confronted them. The author interrupted the lecture to say thanks and walked away, then ignored the FA when she followed up.\n\nI should consider the rules of the airline. If the first class bathroom is off-limits to non-first class passengers, then the author might be in the wrong. However, the author mentioned they've used it before without issues. Maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced, or maybe there's ambiguity. \n\nAlso, the FA's behavior is a factor. The FA was already strict and made a specific announcement. The author didn't follow it, which led to the conflict. But the author's action was to avoid a long line. The FA then followed and lectured the author, who walked away. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away when someone is talking to you can be seen as rude. However, the author might have felt justified given the FA's tone and the situation. The FA's loud reprimand in public could have escalated the situation. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author break a rule? If the bathroom was only for first class, then yes. If not, maybe not. Also, the author's response to the lecture\u2014interrupting and walking away\u2014is a matter of personal choice but could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe author's argument is that the FA's lecture was unnecessary, and they were stressed from a long day. The FA's job is to enforce rules, but the author might not have done anything malicious. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether using the first class bathroom was against the rules. If it's not against the rules, the author isn't in the wrong. If it is, then they are. The user says the author thinks they're not wrong, but there's a chance the airline's policy is clear. However, since the author has done it before without issues, maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced. \n\nIn terms of the follow-up action, walking away is rude, but the FA's handling was unprofessional. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. The answer is probably B, but there's nuance.\n"
