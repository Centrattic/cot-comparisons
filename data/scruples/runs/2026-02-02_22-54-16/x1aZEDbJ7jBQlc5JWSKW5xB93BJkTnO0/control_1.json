I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom as a regular passenger and then walking away from a flight attendant's lecture.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The person has premier status, often sits behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom before landing. The person went to the first class bathroom, which was empty, and then the FA got angry. The person walked away and ignored the FA's comments about being rude.\n\nSo, the main points are: \n\n1. Did the person break any rules by using the first class bathroom? If the airline allows it, maybe not. But if there's a policy against it, then yes. The person mentions they've done it before without issue. But maybe this flight was different. \n\n2. The FA was upset and followed the person. The person walked away, which the FA considered rude. Is walking away from a staff member appropriate? Generally, it's better to listen, even if you disagree. But if the FA was being unnecessarily harsh, maybe the person's reaction is understandable.\n\n3. The user is in a high-status position with the airline (premier status), so maybe there's an expectation of cooperation. However, the FA's approach might have been unprofessional, given they were already acting strangely earlier.\n\nConsiderations: Airline policies might restrict first class amenities to first class passengers. If the person used the first class bathroom without permission, that's against the rules. But if it's allowed, then the FA's reaction is unwarranted. The user's action of walking away could be seen as disrespectful, but if they were in the right, maybe it's justified. \n\nPossible angles: The FA's behavior might have been part of their job, so the user should have complied. Alternatively, if the user didn't break any rules, their reaction is reasonable. Also, the FA's loud lecture in public might have been inappropriate, making the user's silence acceptable.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. The key is whether using the bathroom was against the rules. If it was, the user is in the wrong for breaking the rule and then walking away. If not, the FA was wrong to react that way. The fact that they've used it before without issues suggests maybe it's allowed, but the FA might have had a reason this time. However, the sudden strictness from the FA might indicate a change in policy or a personal vendetta. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, walking away from someone speaking to you is generally considered rude, especially in a professional setting. Even if the person feels the lecture is unwarranted, a better approach might be to calmly explain their side. Walking away could be seen as dismissive, hence why the FA called them out.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user might be in the wrong for walking away and ignoring the FA, regardless of the initial situation. Even if they didn't break a rule, the way they handled the interaction could be seen as disrespectful.\n"
