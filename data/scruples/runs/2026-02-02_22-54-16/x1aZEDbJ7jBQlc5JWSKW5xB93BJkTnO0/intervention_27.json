I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using the first class bathroom when they're seated in the row behind first class. The flight attendant got angry and followed them, calling them rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the airline's policies. The user mentions they've used the front bathroom before without issues. If there's no explicit rule against it, maybe the flight attendant was overstepping. However, sometimes airlines do have specific areas for first class amenities. But the user isn't in first class, just the row behind. Maybe there's a policy that only first class passengers can use that bathroom. If that's the case, the user violated a rule. But the user isn't sure\u2014no one has told them before. \n\nThen, the flight attendant's behavior. The user says the FA was acting bizarrely, strict with rules. This might indicate the FA had a bad day or was overly strict. The user felt the lecture was unnecessary and walked away. The FA followed and accused them of being rude. \n\nThe user's actions: they needed to use the bathroom, saw no line, used the available one. The FA was waiting, possibly to enforce the rule. The user didn't confront her but walked away, which the FA took as rudeness. \n\nIs the user wrong for using the bathroom? If the policy allows it, then no. If not, maybe yes. But since they've done it before without problems, perhaps the airline is inconsistent. The FA's reaction might be disproportionate. The user's response was to cut off the lecture, which could be seen as polite if they didn't want to engage. However, walking away while someone is talking can be rude in general, but if the user felt the lecture was unnecessary, maybe it's justified. \n\nSo, factors: airline policy (unknown but past tolerance), FA's overreaction, user's right to use available facilities. The user's action of walking away might be seen as reasonable given the context. The answer is probably B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
