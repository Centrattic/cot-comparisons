I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a flight attendant lecturing them for using the first class bathroom when they're seated in a row behind first class.\n\nFirst, the key points. The author uses the first class bathroom, which is three rows ahead. The flight attendant then confronts them, the author interrupts to say thanks and walks away, leading the FA to follow and call them rude. The author's defense is that they've used the front bathroom before without issues, and the FA's reaction seems overly harsh.\n\nI need to consider airline policies. Do airlines usually restrict economy passengers from using first class bathrooms? I think sometimes they do, but maybe not always. If there's a policy against it, the author might be at fault. However, if the policy is not clear or inconsistently enforced, the FA's reaction could be at fault.\n\nAlso, the FA's behavior seems erratic. The user mentions the FA was acting bizarre, strict with rules, and making unusual announcements. Maybe the FA is overstepping, especially if the author's action isn't a safety issue. Using the bathroom isn't a safety issue, so the FA's lecture and following the author might be excessive.\n\nThe author's response: interrupting with \"thank you\" and walking away. Is that rude? It's possible, but the context matters. The author felt the lecture was unnecessary and after a long day, chose to disengage. The FA then escalated by yelling in public. The author's action might be justified if they felt the FA was being unreasonable.\n\nThe FA's follow-up comment about rudeness is public shaming, which is inappropriate. The author might have a valid point here. However, if using the wrong bathroom is against the rules, the author might be partly at fault. But if the rules aren't clear, the FA's strictness could be the issue.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, both sides often have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The FA's behavior seems more problematic here\u2014being overly strict, making a scene. The author's action, while perhaps not ideal, might be a reasonable way to avoid a confrontation. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with nuance.\n"
