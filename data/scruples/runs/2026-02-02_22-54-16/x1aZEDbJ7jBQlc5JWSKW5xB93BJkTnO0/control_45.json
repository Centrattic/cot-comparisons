I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom when they were sitting in the row behind first class. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the person has premier status with the airline, which probably gives them certain privileges, like seat selection. They ended up in the row behind first class. The flight attendant made an announcement about using the bathroom now, which led to a long line in the economy section. The first class bathroom was only three rows ahead, so the person used that instead. When they came out, the flight attendant was there and gave them a lecture. The person interrupted the lecture to say \"thank you\" and walked away, leading the FA to follow and call them rude.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the rules. Airlines usually have specific areas for first class and economy passengers. Even if the person is in a seat near first class, using the first class facilities might be restricted to first class passengers. However, the person might have done this before without issues, so maybe the policy isn't strictly enforced. But the flight attendant is enforcing the rule now, so there's a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the person violate a policy by using the first class bathroom? If yes, then the FA has a right to correct them. But the person argues that they've done it before without a problem. The response to the lecture is where it gets tricky. The person interrupted the lecture and walked away, which the FA found rude. The FA then followed them and continued the lecture loudly. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, walking away from someone who is talking to you is generally considered rude, regardless of the situation. The person might feel justified if they believe they didn't do anything wrong, but interrupting and walking out could come off as disrespectful. The FA's job is to enforce rules and maintain order, so if the person is seen as challenging authority, that could be an issue.\n\nHowever, the flight attendant's behavior might also be in question. If the lecture was perceived as overly harsh or unnecessary, that could escalate the situation. The person mentions that the FA was already acting strangely, being stringent with rules and making extra announcements. So maybe the FA was overstepping, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the person of being rude when they walked away.\n\nIn terms of company policy, airlines typically have guidelines for passenger behavior. If using the first class bathroom is against the rules for non-first class passengers, then the person might be in the wrong. But if the policy is ambiguous and the person has done it before without issues, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the FA is there to enforce the rules as they see them, even if inconsistently.\n\nThe person's response\u2014interrupting the lecture and walking away\u2014is where the blame might lie. Even if they felt the FA was being unreasonable, cutting off the conversation and ignoring the FA could be seen as disrespectful. The FA might have been trying to address a policy violation, and the person's reaction made it worse. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's some ambiguity about the bathroom usage policy, the act of walking away from the flight attendant during a lecture is likely considered rude and uncooperative, which would make the author at least partially at fault. However, the FA's handling of the situation could also be criticized. But based on typical expectations, the author's behavior towards the FA is probably the main issue here.\n"
