I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they used the first class bathroom despite not being a first class passenger, got lectured by a flight attendant, and then walked away when the FA followed them and called them rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the airline. The user mentions they're in a seat right behind first class and have premier status, which sometimes allows access to certain amenities. But does the airline's policy permit non-first class passengers to use the first class bathroom? If there's a rule against that, then the user might be at fault for violating it, even if the FA was being overly strict before.\n\nHowever, the user also says they've used the front bathroom before without any issues. That implies that the policy might not be consistently enforced, or maybe it's allowed depending on the situation. If that's the case, maybe the user isn't necessarily wrong if others have done the same without problems.\n\nThe FA's reaction is important. The user was polite by saying \"thank you for telling me\" before walking away, which could be seen as a way to end the conversation without conflict. The FA then followed them and made a public comment. The user's action of walking away after a polite acknowledgment might not be rude, especially if they were trying to avoid an unnecessary lecture. \n\nBut the FA's job is to enforce policies, even if they seem strict. If the user is causing a disruption by using a restricted bathroom, that could make their actions inappropriate. The user's argument is that the lecture felt unnecessary and they were just being considerate of their own time after a long day. \n\nOn the other hand, the FA was likely following protocol. The user's response might be seen as dismissive, even if they were polite. Walking away could be perceived as disrespectful, regardless of the FA's tone. \n\nI should also consider the context of frequent flying and premier status. Maybe the user is used to more lenient treatment, but that doesn't mean the current FA is wrong to enforce the rules. \n\nIn the end, the user might have broken a rule, even if previous experiences were different. The FA's job is to ensure compliance with the airline's policies. So, the author could be at fault for using a restricted bathroom and then walking away during a reprimand. However, the FA's loud response and following the user might also be inappropriate. \n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. The main issue is using the first class bathroom. If the policy is against it, then the author is in the wrong. If the policy is flexible, maybe not. Since the user didn't mention a specific policy, but the FA was enforcing it, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. So, answer A.\n"
