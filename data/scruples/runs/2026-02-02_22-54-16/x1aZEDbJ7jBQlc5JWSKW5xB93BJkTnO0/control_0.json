I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the first class bathroom even though they're in economy class. The flight attendant reprimanded them, and the author walked away, then ignored further comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. The author mentions that they've used the front bathroom before without issues. But maybe there's a policy against non-first class passengers using that bathroom. However, the author is a frequent flyer with premier status, and the bathroom was only three rows ahead. The flight attendant's reaction seems harsh, especially with the long lines in economy. \n\nThe author's actions: using the first class bathroom when there's no line versus a long line in economy. Did they break a rule? Maybe. But if the flight attendants usually don't enforce it unless there's a reason, like safety, perhaps the flight attendant was overstepping. The author's response: interrupting with \"thank you\" and walking away. Then being followed and called rude. \n\nIs walking away rude? The author felt the lecture was unnecessary after a long day. The flight attendant's response was loud and public, which might have been unprofessional. However, the author did interrupt the FA's reprimand, which could be seen as dismissive. \n\nI think the key points are whether using the first class bathroom violates any rules and whether walking away was rude. If the policy allows premier passengers to use first class amenities, then the FA was wrong. But if there's a strict rule against it, the author is in the wrong. Since the author mentions others have used it before without issues, maybe the policy isn't enforced strictly. The FA's loud reprimand suggests she overreacted. The author's interruption and walking away might be seen as rude, but given the context, maybe justified. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if the policy isn't strictly enforced, but if there's a clear rule against it, they might be. However, the FA's behavior was unprofessional. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the FA's reaction was excessive and the author was trying to avoid an unnecessary lecture. So answer B.\n"
