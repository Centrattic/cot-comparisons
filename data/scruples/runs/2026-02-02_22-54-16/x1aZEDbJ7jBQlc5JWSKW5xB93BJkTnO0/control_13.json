I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I\u2019m not upgraded.\n\nLast night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).\n\nSo before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.\n\nThis announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. \n\nI needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.\n\nWhen I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).\n\nShe proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I\u2019d had a long and difficult work day and didn\u2019t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say \u201cthank you for telling me\u201d and walked away.\n\nShe proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said \u201cit\u2019s extremely rude to walk away from people when they\u2019re talking to you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nAt this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. \n\nAITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I\u2019ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don\u2019t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Used the \u201cwrong bathroom,\u201d got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they used the first class bathroom even though they're in economy class. The flight attendant got upset and lectured them, and the author walked away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Airlines usually have specific areas for first class and economy passengers. Using the first class bathroom might be against their policies. Even if the author has premier status, that might not grant them access to first class amenities unless they're upgraded. So maybe the flight attendant was right to point out the violation.\n\nBut the author mentions they've done this before without issues. That complicates things. If previous FAs didn't say anything, maybe the rule isn't always enforced. However, consistency in rules is important for the airline. If the author used the bathroom multiple times, they might have known it's against the rules, even if others didn't enforce it.\n\nThen there's the response. The FA was following up, and the author walked away. The FA told them it's rude to walk away, which is a valid point. Being respectful to staff is important, even if you disagree. The author's reaction could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, especially since the FA was doing their job.\n\nThe author's justification was having a long day and not wanting to listen to a lecture. That's understandable, but it's still important to address the situation properly. Maybe they could have politely explained their side or apologized if they were wrong. Walking away and ignoring the FA might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nAlso, the FA was acting a bit overly strict with other passengers, which the author noticed. That might have made the interaction feel unfair. But that doesn't mean the author was in the right. Even if the FA was harsh, the author's actions might have been a rule violation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author probably broke a policy by using the first class bathroom. Their response of walking away and ignoring the FA added to the issue. So, they might be at least partially at fault. However, the FA's behavior was also questionable. But since the question is about the author's wrongness, the answer leans towards A (yes).\n"
