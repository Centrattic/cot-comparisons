We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The situation involves a man changing his daughter's custody schedule and his girlfriend reacting negatively by ending their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man has custody of his 3-year-old daughter since her mother had substance abuse and infidelity issues. They agreed on a 2-2-3 schedule, but he changed it to have her more on weekends. His girlfriend, who he's been with for 6 months, is upset because she feels sidelined. She hung up and ended the relationship when he told her about the schedule change.\n\nThe main issue here is whether changing the custody schedule was the wrong move, especially considering the girlfriend's reaction. But wait, custody arrangements can be a complex legal matter. The father still has full custody, but the mother has visitation rights. The user claims he's making the change because the mother is using babysitters, which he finds problematic. The girlfriend, however, sees this as prioritizing his daughter over their relationship.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as the custodial parent, he might have the authority to adjust the schedule if it's in the child's best interest. However, changing custody schedules typically requires agreement from both parents, especially if they were previously in a 50/50 arrangement. But in this case, the mother gave up custody, so maybe the father has more leeway. Still, it's important to consider if the change was done properly, perhaps through legal channels if needed.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is emotional. She's been involved with the daughter, and the sudden change might make her feel like her role is being diminished. But the father's priority is his daughter's well-being. The user argues that his family can help, so the girlfriend isn't sidelined entirely. However, the girlfriend might feel that her time with him is being reduced, leading to her breaking up the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the father is wrong for changing the schedule. The girlfriend isn't a parent, so she doesn't have legal rights here. The father's responsibility is to his child. The girlfriend's reaction, while hurtful, might be her way of expressing feeling neglected. But the father is making a decision that he believes is best for his daughter. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's hard to blame him for prioritizing his child. The girlfriend's reaction might be immature, but he's not in the wrong for making a tough decision. The key is whether the change was justified and if he handled the communication properly. The father did explain his reasons, and the girlfriend's response was extreme. Therefore, the father isn't the asshole here.\n"
