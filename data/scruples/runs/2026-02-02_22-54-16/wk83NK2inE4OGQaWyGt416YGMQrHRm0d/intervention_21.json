We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author is a single parent who has custody of his daughter. The ex has been working towards 50/50 time, but due to her new business, the daughter is often with babysitters. The author changed the schedule to have Thursday-Sunday to minimize the daughter's time with sitters. The girlfriend, who he's been dating for about six months, is upset and ended things, feeling she's not a priority.\n\nSo, the author's main concern is the well-being of his child. He's been the sole provider and emotional support since the divorce. The ex's substance abuse and infidelity led to full custody, but she's trying to improve. The author is trying to adjust the schedule because he's unhappy with the daughter being with sitters instead of her mother. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be about feeling de-prioritized because of the new schedule.\n\nThe author is trying to balance his responsibilities as a parent with his new relationship. He made the changes in consultation with the ex, which shows he's trying to be cooperative. The girlfriend's immediate reaction of breaking up over the schedule seems to indicate that she's not comfortable with the level of time he needs to spend with his daughter. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if changing the schedule is reasonable. Since the author has custody and the ex's work situation is causing the daughter to be with sitters, adjusting the schedule to ensure the daughter has consistent time with a parent (himself) seems justified. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from expectations not being met, but the author's priority is his child. \n\nIs there a wrong here? The author is prioritizing his daughter's needs, which is a parent's responsibility. The girlfriend may not have realized the depth of his commitment when entering the relationship. The author didn't try to hide the situation from her, so he's not deceptive. The ex's situation complicates things, but the author is acting in his child's best interest. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
