We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a parent changing their daughter's custody schedule, which affects their new relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has custody of their 3-year-old daughter. The ex started a business and was using babysitters a lot. The author changed the schedule to have the daughter every Thursday to Sunday. The new girlfriend reacted negatively, leading to a break-up. The author is now asking if they were wrong to prioritize their child over the relationship.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the custody arrangement. The author has full custody but agreed to a 50/50 schedule. The ex's use of babysitters and substance abuse history might be valid concerns. The author adjusted the schedule to ensure the daughter is with them more, especially since the ex's work schedule might mean the daughter is with sitters otherwise.\n\nThe new girlfriend is upset because the schedule change reduces the time they have together. The author argues that the child's well-being is their priority. But the relationship is only 6 months old, and the author seems to have made the decision unilaterally without considering the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that they discussed the schedule change with the ex. So the adjustment is mutual. The problem arises with the girlfriend's reaction. The author made sure the new partner was involved in their time with the daughter when possible. However, the girlfriend's reaction is a deal-breaker for her, which might be a red flag about her attitude towards the child.\n\nThe author's stance is that the child comes first, which is natural, but the way they communicated the schedule change and the girlfriend's response are problematic. The author might have failed to consider the girlfriend's perspective here, even though the primary responsibility is to the child. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum seems extreme for a 6-month relationship, especially if the author is already balancing family and new relationships.\n\nSo, is the author the asshole? Probably not. They prioritized their child's needs, which is their responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction highlights a lack of willingness to integrate into the author's family situation. The author isn't in the wrong for making a decision that's in their child's best interest, even if it affects the relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
