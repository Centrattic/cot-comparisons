We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a man who has custody of his 3-year-old daughter after a divorce where the mother had substance abuse issues and infidelity. The mother is now trying to have 50/50 custody, and they've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. The man is in a new relationship, and the girlfriend reacted negatively when he changed the schedule to have the daughter on Thursday-Friday-Saturday-Sunday. The GF said \"there goes our weekends\" and threatened to break up if he did the new schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The father's primary responsibility is to his daughter, especially given the mother's history. The ex is now working a business that leads to the daughter being with sitters, which the father is upset about. He changed the schedule to spend more time with his daughter. The girlfriend didn't like that the new schedule took up his weekends, which he had been spending with her. He explained that family (mother, grandmother) can watch the daughter when needed. The GF hung up and later threatened to end the relationship, implying he's not prioritizing her.\n\nThe father is in a new relationship, which is only 6 months old. He's been clear that the child comes first. The GF's reaction seems to be about how the new schedule affects their time together. The question is whether he was wrong to prioritize his daughter over the relationship.\n\nIn terms of child custody, the father has full custody, and the mother gave it up voluntarily. So, the father's decision to adjust the schedule to ensure his daughter is with him more, especially when the mother's availability is limited due to work, seems reasonable. The GF is not part of the legal custody equation, so her being upset about the schedule change shouldn't be the main consideration. The father's primary responsibility is to his child, and he's been the sole provider emotionally and financially. His new partner's reaction seems to be about her own expectations not aligning with his responsibilities as a parent.\n\nThe father stood his ground, which is understandable given the context. He's been consistent in prioritizing his daughter, which is what's expected in such situations. The GF's threat to end the relationship because of this might indicate that she wasn't prepared for the realities of being in a relationship with a single parent. However, that doesn't make the father wrong for prioritizing his child. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
