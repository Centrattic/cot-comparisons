We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who's adjusting their child's schedule after a divorce and a new relationship.\n\nFirst, the dad has custody of his 3-year-old daughter because the mom had substance abuse and infidelity issues. They've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. The mom started a business, so the daughter is with sitters more when with her. The dad wants to change the schedule so he can have her Thurs-Sun, which is his weekend off, to avoid her being with sitters. \n\nHe's in a new relationship with a woman who got involved quickly. When he tells her about the schedule change, she gets upset and says it's the end of their relationship. He stands by his decision, thinking the kid comes first.\n\nNow, is he wrong? Well, the dad's priority is his child, which makes sense given the history. The mom voluntarily gave up custody, and he's been the main provider and emotional support. The new partner seems to expect more time with him, but he's balancing parenting duties. \n\nThe woman's reaction is extreme. She's threatening to end the relationship over a schedule change that's been discussed with the ex. The dad is trying to minimize babysitters, which is reasonable. The woman wasn't part of the custody arrangement decisions, so her taking it as a personal priority might be unreasonable. \n\nHe's been involving her in activities with the daughter when he's not with her, so he's making an effort. The problem is her reaction, not his prioritization of his daughter. He's not wrong in prioritizing his child's well-being, especially given the mother's past issues. The woman might need to reconsider if she can handle his commitment to his child.\n"
