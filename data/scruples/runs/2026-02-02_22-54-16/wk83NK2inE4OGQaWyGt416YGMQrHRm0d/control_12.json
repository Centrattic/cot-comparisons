We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author has a 3-year-old daughter. He and the mother divorced when she was about a year old. The mother had substance abuse and infidelity issues, which led her to voluntarily give up custody. Now, she's trying to have 50/50 time, and they've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. The author is the sole provider and has been the primary parent since the divorce. \n\nRecently, the mother started a mobile spray tanning business, leading to the daughter being with babysitters instead of her mom. The author feels this is problematic and wants to adjust the schedule to have more time with his daughter on weekends (Thu-Sun), leaving the mother with Mon-Wed. The author's new girlfriend, who he's been involving in activities with the daughter, reacts negatively, saying \"there goes our weekends\" and later threatens to end the relationship if the schedule changes. The author stands by his decision, prioritizing his daughter, and the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is prioritizing his daughter over his new relationship, which the girlfriend is upset about. The author argues that as her primary parent, he must ensure she's with him more, especially since the mother isn't fulfilling her time properly. The girlfriend's reaction is that she's being demoted to second place.\n\nLegally, the author has custody, so he has the right to make decisions regarding custody arrangements as long as they align with the child's best interest. The mother's use of babysitters might be a valid concern for the author to address in the schedule. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling she's not a priority. However, in a relationship, especially with a new partner, it's important to consider how major life decisions affect the other person. But the author's responsibility to his daughter is significant. \n\nThe author did involve the girlfriend in their activities when he didn't have the daughter, which shows he's trying to balance both. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum might be unrealistic, as the author's primary responsibility is to his child. The author isn't in a position to prioritize a new relationship over his daughter's well-being, especially given the history with the ex. \n\nSo, while the author's decision might affect the relationship, it's not necessarily his fault if the girlfriend cannot accept his priorities. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
