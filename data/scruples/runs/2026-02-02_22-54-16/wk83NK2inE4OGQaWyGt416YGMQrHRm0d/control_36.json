We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a father has a 3-year-old daughter. He had full custody because the mother had substance abuse and infidelity issues. They've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for 50/50 time, and they just changed it to the father having her on Thursday to Sunday. The mother works until 5 PM, so the kid is with her from 5 PM to 9 PM asleep. But the problem is the new girlfriend. When the father told her about the schedule change, she got upset and said the weekends are gone, then broke up with him over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's perspective. He's the primary caregiver, dealing with a former mother who wasn't around. He's trying to ensure the kid has a stable, parent-focused environment. The mother's job is a mobile spray tanning business, which might mean she's out with different people, so the kid is with sitters. The father is concerned about her safety and wants more time with her. The schedule change is to prevent the daughter from being with strangers. That seems reasonable from a parental responsibility standpoint.\n\nBut then the girlfriend reacts strongly. She feels like the father is prioritizing his daughter over the relationship, which is a valid concern for her. However, the father has made it clear that the child comes first, which is typical in parenting. The question is whether the girlfriend has a right to expect the weekends for themselves, and if the father's response is dismissive.\n\nThe key points here: The father is a parent, and the child's well-being is his primary responsibility. The girlfriend is a new partner, and relationships require mutual consideration. But when it comes to children, the parent's commitment to their child is a significant factor. The father isn't being unfair by prioritizing his daughter's needs, especially given the mother's history. The girlfriend might need to understand that the father's commitment to his child isn't a competition. However, the way he responded might have been abrupt, not giving her enough consideration. But given the context, maybe he's not wrong. The girlfriend's reaction could be seen as expecting too much, especially in a 6-month relationship where he's already been balancing his daughter's needs. \n\nIs the father in the wrong? Probably not. He's fulfilling his parental duties, and the schedule change is for the child's benefit. The girlfriend may need to accept that or maybe it's not a compatible relationship. The father didn't force the schedule change without the mother's agreement, so that's good. The girlfriend's immediate reaction seems extreme but doesn't make the father the asshole. The answer is B.\n"
