We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong for changing their daughter's schedule. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe user is a parent who has custody of their 3-year-old daughter because the ex had substance abuse and infidelity issues. The ex started cleaning up and got 50/50 time, so they've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. Then the user got into a new relationship. The ex now has a mobile tanning business, leading to the daughter being with babysitters. The user is bothered by this and wants to change the schedule. They worked out a new arrangement where the user has the daughter every Thursday to Sunday. \n\nThe new partner, who's been great, reacted negatively, saying that the new schedule means no weekends for them. The user explained that family is available to watch the daughter, but the partner hung up and later said the relationship is over if the schedule changes. The user stands by their decision, prioritizing the child's well-being, and ends the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is: Is the user in the wrong? The user thinks they're not. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. The user's main concern is the well-being of their daughter. The ex's situation with sitters is a problem, and the user wants to ensure the daughter has stable, loving time with a parent. The new partner's reaction seems to be about their own priorities conflicting with the user's parental duties. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, putting the child first is generally seen as right. The user isn't being selfish; they're trying to address a problematic situation. The partner's reaction might be immature, seeing the change as a personal rejection rather than a necessary adjustment for the child. The user also mentions involving family for support, so they're not being unreasonable. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the user didn't consider the partner's feelings enough. But the user has been including the partner in their time with the daughter when possible. The new schedule is about fixing an existing problem, not just preference. The partner's ultimatum seems extreme, especially given the short duration of the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user is prioritizing their child's needs, which is typically seen as the correct choice. The partner's reaction is more about their own issues with the schedule change. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
