We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe situation involves a man who has custody of his 3-year-old daughter after a divorce. His ex has been working on improving her life, and they've been trying a 2-2-3 custody schedule for six months. Now, he's in a new relationship with a woman who has become a big part of his life and his family's life. \n\nHe decided to change the custody schedule to have the daughter every Thursday through Sunday, so that the daughter isn't with a babysitter as much when with the ex. The ex works late, and the daughter is asleep by 9 PM, so maybe the mother can't take her during the week. The woman in the new relationship, when he told her about the new schedule, immediately reacted negatively, saying that their weekends are gone. He explained that his family can help, but she hung up and later said the relationship is over if he keeps the new schedule.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider his primary responsibility as a parent. The ex had substance abuse and infidelity issues, leading to full custody. The ex is now trying to improve, but the author is concerned about the child's well-being when with the ex, especially with babysitters. Changing the schedule to have more time with the daughter and reduce the child's time with sitters seems like a parental concern. \n\nHowever, the new partner's reaction is about the relationship's future. The author argues that the child comes first, which is understandable. But the partner might feel that her needs are being neglected. The author is trying to balance custody and his new relationship. \n\nThe key points: The author is acting in what he believes is the best interest of his child, given the history. The ex is voluntarily giving time, but it's leading to the child being with sitters. The author's new partner might feel that the relationship isn't a priority, which could be a valid concern. However, the author is prioritizing his role as a parent, which is a fundamental responsibility.\n\nThe woman's reaction seems extreme, ending the relationship over custody changes. The author is trying to protect his daughter, which is a reasonable action. The partner might not be considering the child's well-being in this context. \n\nSo, the author's actions are based on parental duty, and the woman's response is more about her own feelings of being secondary. Since the parent's responsibility to the child is primary, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
