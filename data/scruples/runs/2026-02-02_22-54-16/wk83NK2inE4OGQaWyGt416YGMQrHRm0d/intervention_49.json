We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who has custody of his 3-year-old daughter after a divorce. The ex had substance abuse and infidelity issues, leading to full custody for the father. They've been doing a 2-2-3 split for 6 months. Then he starts a new relationship, and the woman he's dating gets upset when he changes the schedule to spend more time with his daughter. The GF reacts strongly, saying the relationship is over if he does that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his responsibilities as a parent. He's the sole provider and has been since day one. The ex has started trying to get more involved, but the dad is concerned about her using babysitters. The new schedule gives him more time with the kid, which seems reasonable given his history. He's also involving his family to help with childcare when needed, which shows he's trying to balance things without cutting the GF out entirely.\n\nThe GF's reaction seems a bit over the top. The author mentions that he's been making sure she's involved when he's not with the daughter. So maybe he's already including her in family activities. But when he changes the schedule, she interprets it as her not being a priority. But from his perspective, the daughter's well-being is the top priority. He's had custody because the ex had issues, so putting the child first makes sense. The GF might be expecting more time but isn't understanding the long-term commitment and past issues involved.\n\nThe key points here are the father's role as the primary caregiver and the necessity to ensure the child's stability. The GF is a new partner, and while relationships are important, the child's needs might take precedence, especially considering the ex's history. The dad didn't just exclude the GF; he offered family support for childcare, which shows he's trying to be considerate. The GF's ultimatum seems harsh in light of the child's best interests.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's prioritizing his daughter's needs after a difficult family situation. The GF's reaction is self-centered in this context. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
