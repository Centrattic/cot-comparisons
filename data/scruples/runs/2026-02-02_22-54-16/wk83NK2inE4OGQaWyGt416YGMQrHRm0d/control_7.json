We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy who has custody of his 3-year-old daughter after his ex-wife had substance abuse and infidelity issues. They were doing a 2-2-3 schedule for 50/50 time, but the ex's new job as a mobile spray tanning business means the kid is with sitters a lot. So they changed the schedule to the dad having her every weekend, which the guy is okay with because he's been the primary caregiver and wants the daughter to spend time with a parent instead of a sitter.\n\nThen he introduces the new woman in his life, who reacted negatively when he told her about the schedule change. She said \"there goes our weekends\" and later threatened to end the relationship if he kept the new schedule. The dad stood his ground, prioritizing his daughter over the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the dad's actions are justified. He's the primary caregiver, has custody, and the ex's new job is causing the child to be with sitters. The dad is trying to adjust the schedule to ensure the child is with a parent more. That seems reasonable, especially since the ex's situation hasn't been stable. \n\nThe new girlfriend's reaction is a problem. She's treating the schedule change as a personal attack, implying she's his top priority. But the dad is a parent, and a parent's priority is their child's well-being. A healthy relationship should respect that. If she's not okay with him prioritizing his daughter, maybe she's not the right partner. \n\nThe dad did involve her in his time with the daughter when he's not working, which shows he's trying to balance both. But she's making the relationship conditional on his ability to be with her on weekends. That's not fair. Relationships require compromise, but expecting someone to drop their responsibilities as a parent is unreasonable. \n\nSo, the dad isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his daughter's best interests. The girlfriend's reaction is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
