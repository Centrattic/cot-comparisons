We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for changing their daughter's schedule. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author has a 3-year-old daughter. The ex-wife had substance abuse and infidelity issues, leading her to give up custody voluntarily. They've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months, which the ex is now trying to change. The ex started a business, so the daughter is often with babysitters. The author wants to adjust the schedule to spend more time with the daughter, especially since he's the sole provider. Then, he starts a new relationship with a woman who reacts badly when he tells her about the schedule change, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author's priority is his daughter's well-being. He's been the primary caregiver and provider, so wanting to maximize time with her is understandable. The ex's situation with her business and babysitters is a concern, as it's not ideal for a young child. The author's decision to adjust the schedule seems to be in the child's best interest, especially since the ex isn't providing consistent parental time.\n\nThe new partner's reaction seems to stem from feeling de-prioritized. She took his focus on the child as a rejection of her. However, the author has been clear about his commitment to his daughter since the start of the relationship. It's important to note that the author had already established a relationship with the woman and included her in activities when the daughter wasn't with him. The breakup was her choice when she realized the schedule change might limit their time together.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, putting the child first is natural. The author isn't abandoning his responsibilities but is adjusting to better meet the child's needs. The ex's situation complicates things, but the author is addressing the issue by ensuring the daughter isn't left with sitters. The partner's inability to accept this priority might indicate a mismatch in values rather than the author being in the wrong.\n\nI don't see any malicious intent from the author. He's made efforts to communicate and even offered family support. The partner's ultimatum is extreme, and the author stood by his decision, which is reasonable. So, the answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
