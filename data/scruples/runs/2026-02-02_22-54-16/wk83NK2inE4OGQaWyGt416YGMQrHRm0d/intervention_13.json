We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a guy who has custody of his 3-year-old daughter since her mother had substance abuse and infidelity issues. They had a 2-2-3 schedule for the past six months, but the ex wanted to change it because she's starting a business and the kid ends up with babysitters. They agreed on a new schedule where the dad has the daughter on Thursdays through Sundays. The problem is his new girlfriend, who reacted negatively when he told her about the schedule change, saying \"there goes our weekends\" and then threatening to break up if he goes through with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's perspective. His daughter is his top priority, and he's been the sole provider and emotional support since her mother gave up custody. The ex is trying to get more time, but it's leading to the daughter being with sitters. The dad is trying to adjust the schedule to ensure the daughter is with him more, especially on weekends. He's also making sure his girlfriend is involved with the kid when he's not around. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to be about feeling de-prioritized. But is that a valid reason to end the relationship over a 6-month-old relationship? The dad argues that being a parent is his first priority, which is understandable. The question is whether his actions are reasonable or if he's wrong for not changing the schedule for the girlfriend's sake.\n\nFrom the info given, the girlfriend knew the dad's commitment to his daughter from the start. If she's now upset about the schedule change, maybe she wasn't prepared for that aspect of the relationship. The dad's family is involved, so he's not neglecting his personal life entirely. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, but does that make the dad in the wrong? Probably not. He's fulfilling his parental duties, which are essential. The girlfriend might need to consider if she can handle the reality of a relationship with a parent in a custody situation. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. He's prioritizing his daughter's well-being, which is his responsibility. The girlfriend's reaction is about her own expectations not being met, but that doesn't make him the asshole here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
