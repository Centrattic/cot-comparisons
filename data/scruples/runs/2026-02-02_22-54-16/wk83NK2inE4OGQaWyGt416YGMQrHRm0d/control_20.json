We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a 3-year-old daughter. He has custody because the ex had substance abuse and infidelity, and she gave up custody voluntarily. They've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past six months. The ex started a business and now the daughter is with babysitters when with her. The author is concerned about the child's well-being, so they agreed to a new schedule where he gets Thursday to Sunday, which is weekends. \n\nThen he got into a relationship. He's been involving the new girlfriend in family time when he's with the daughter. When he told her about the schedule change, she reacted negatively, saying \"there goes our weekends\" and later threatening to end the relationship if he sticks to the schedule. He stood his ground, prioritizing his daughter, and she ended things. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the parent's responsibility to their child versus the new relationship. The ex's situation is a red flag for the author, given her history. The author is trying to ensure the daughter is in a stable environment. The girlfriend's reaction seems to take a backseat to the parent's responsibilities. \n\nThe author isn't trying to compete with the girlfriend for priority; he's a parent, and the child's well-being is paramount. The girlfriend's inability to accept that might indicate the relationship wasn't built on a solid foundation to handle his responsibilities. However, the author did involve her in family time when possible, showing he values her, but the child's need comes first.\n\nThe question is whether changing the schedule is wrong. The author had a valid reason based on the ex's situation and the child's best interest. The girlfriend's reaction to the schedule change as a deal-breaker suggests she might not be able to handle the reality of his life. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's prioritizing his daughter, which is the right thing to do. The girlfriend's response was overly self-centered in this context. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
