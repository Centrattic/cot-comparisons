We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The story is about a father adjusting his daughter's schedule and then dealing with his girlfriend's reaction. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The father has full custody but agreed to a 50/50 arrangement with his ex, who has substance abuse and infidelity issues. He's trying to ensure his daughter isn't with babysitters during the time she's with her mother. Then he introduces a new schedule: the daughter is with him every Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. His girlfriend reacts negatively, saying \"there goes our weekends\" and ends the relationship if he proceeds. The father stands by his decision, prioritizing his child.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong. The main points here are child custody, the father's responsibility, and the girlfriend's reaction. The ex has a history of problems, which might make the father's actions more about the child's well-being. However, the girlfriend feels neglected, which is a valid concern in a relationship.\n\nBut the father's role as a parent is primary. He's the custodial parent, and his decisions regarding custody and visitation schedules would typically be focused on the child's best interests. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be a conflict between his responsibilities as a parent and his new relationship. \n\nHowever, the father is using his weekends for the child, which are the times he's off. The girlfriend might feel that the father isn't making her a priority, but the father is prioritizing his daughter. In relationships, partners need to respect each other's commitments. If she can't accept his parental responsibilities, that's an issue on her side. \n\nThe father isn't wrong for adjusting the schedule to protect his daughter from his ex's past issues. The girlfriend's ultimatum suggests she didn't consider the depth of his commitment to his child. So, the father isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
