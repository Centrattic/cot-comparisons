We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation they described. The scenario involves a custody arrangement, a new relationship, and a conflict between the author and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author has custody of his daughter because the ex had substance abuse and infidelity issues. They've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months, and the ex started a tanning business, leading to the daughter being with sitters more. The author wanted to adjust the schedule to spend more time with the daughter and reduce babysitting. The girlfriend reacted negatively, saying weekends are gone and that the author isn't prioritizing her. The author stood his ground, leading to a breakup.\n\nI need to consider the key points. The author's primary responsibility is his daughter's well-being. Custody arrangements are in place, and he's adjusting for the child's benefit. The girlfriend is upset about losing weekend time, but the author's focus on his child is a valid parental duty. The ex's situation with the business and the daughter's time with sitters is a concern for the author, who is trying to ensure the child has consistent parental care.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to be about her own needs not being prioritized, but the author's commitment to his daughter is not unreasonable. The author is clear that his daughter comes first, which is a responsible stance. The girlfriend might not have considered the complexity of the custody situation and the author's history with the ex. The author's decision to prioritize his daughter over a new relationship doesn't make him the asshole; it shows he's committed to his child's needs.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. The author didn't consult the girlfriend more before making the change. But the problem was with the ex's schedule, not the girlfriend. The author's intention was to address a prior issue with the ex, not to push the girlfriend aside. The girlfriend's response seems to conflate the new relationship with the custody arrangements, which might not be fair. The author is in a tough spot, balancing his responsibilities and new relationship, but his actions are in the child's best interest.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
