We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The story is from Reddit, so it's part of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The author has a 3-year-old daughter. He was divorced from the mother when the child was less than a year old because she had substance abuse and infidelity issues, leading to full custody being given to him. Now, the mother has cleaned up and is asking for 50/50 time. They've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. Then he starts a new relationship. The mother's new business means the child is with sitters a lot, which upsets him. They decide to change the schedule to give him more time with the daughter (Thursday-Sunday). \n\nHe tells his new girlfriend about the change, and she reacts negatively, saying \"there goes our weekends,\" implying she's upset that he's prioritizing the child over their time together. The author explains that his family can help, but she ends the relationship over it.\n\nSo the question is: Is he in the wrong?\n\nThe key points here are about priorities and communication. The author is a parent, and the new girlfriend is not part of the legal guardianship. The mother's situation has changed, and the author is trying to adjust the custody to ensure the child isn't left with sitters. However, this decision affects his new relationship. The girlfriend seems to be expecting a certain level of commitment from him, but he's prioritizing the child.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, the author has custody, so his decisions about the child's schedule are his to make, especially if they're in the child's best interest. The ex has been working on her issues, but the author is concerned about the child's time with sitters. The relationship with the girlfriend is new (6 months), and she's reacting strongly to a decision that's about the child's well-being. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to be that she's not willing to accept that the author's primary responsibility is to his daughter. The author is firm in his decision, which is understandable. However, the girlfriend's immediate reaction to end the relationship might be a red flag about her expectations. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he's making decisions in his daughter's best interest, and the girlfriend can't accept that, then the blame isn't on the author. The girlfriend might have unrealistic expectations about where his priorities lie. However, he could have considered the impact on the relationship. But since the daughter is his legal responsibility, and the ex's situation is part of the reason for the schedule change, it's more about the child's needs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
