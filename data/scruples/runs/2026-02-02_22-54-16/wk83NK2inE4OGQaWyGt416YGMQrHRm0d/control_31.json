We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe user is a father who has full custody of his 3-year-old daughter because the mother had substance abuse and infidelity issues. They were divorced when the daughter was less than a year old. The mother started improving and asked for 50/50 time, which the father agreed to, and they've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. Recently, the father got into a relationship with a woman who is great and has been involved with the daughter when he's not with her. \n\nThe issue now is that the ex's job as a mobile spray tanning business means the daughter is often with babysitters. The father is upset about this and wanted to adjust the schedule so he can spend more time with his daughter, specifically on weekends when he's off work. The new schedule gives him Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. He thought this would help because the ex works until 5 PM and the daughter sleeps by 9 PM, so maybe she won't be with sitters three days a week.\n\nWhen he tells his girlfriend about the new schedule, she reacts negatively, saying \"Well there goes our weekends!\" and eventually ends the relationship. The father explains that his family can help if needed, but she seems to take it as a rejection of her and the relationship. The father stands by his decision, prioritizing his daughter, and asks if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the father is in the wrong for changing the schedule and prioritizing his daughter over the new relationship. \n\nFirst, the father has custody and is the primary caregiver. The mother's history with substance abuse and infidelity led to full custody, which the court likely determined in the best interest of the child. The father is trying to adjust the schedule because the mother is using babysitters, which he's unhappy with. His intent is to ensure the child has more parent time, which is a valid concern, especially given the mother's past issues. \n\nThe father's girlfriend reacts strongly to the schedule change, but it seems like she might not understand the context. The father mentions that he's made sure she's included in his time with the daughter when he's not scheduled. However, when he changes the schedule, she feels it's a priority shift. But from the father's perspective, the child's well-being is paramount. \n\nThe key factors here are the legal custody arrangement, the father's role as the primary caregiver, and the girlfriend's reaction. The father isn't necessarily at fault for prioritizing his daughter's needs. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own expectations, but the father shouldn't be forced to compromise the child's welfare for a relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the father didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings enough. But given the situation and the child's best interests, the father's actions seem justified. The girlfriend's response might indicate that she wasn't prepared for the complexities of a relationship with someone who has custody of a young child. \n\nIn conclusion, the father isn't in the wrong because he's acting in his daughter's best interest, especially considering the mother's history. The girlfriend's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't make the father at fault.\n"
