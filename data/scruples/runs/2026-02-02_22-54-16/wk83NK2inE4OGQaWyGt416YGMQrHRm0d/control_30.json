We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is a parent with a 3-year-old daughter. The ex-wife has substance abuse issues and infidelity, leading to the author having full custody. But now the ex is trying to have 50/50 time under a 2-2-3 schedule. The author changed the schedule to have the daughter every Thursday to Sunday, which he's off weekends. The reason is that the ex is using babysitters when she has the child, and the author wants the child to have more stable parent time. \n\nThen, the author's new girlfriend reacts negatively, saying \"there goes our weekends\" and threatening to end the relationship if the schedule doesn't change. The author stands his ground, prioritizing his daughter, and the girlfriend breaks up with him. The author is now asking if he's the asshole for changing the schedule and not backing down.\n\nSo, the key points here are the custody arrangement, the ex's situation, the new relationship, and the conflict that arose. The author is a parent who has been the sole provider and emotionally supportive since the divorce. The ex is trying to get more time, but maybe not following through properly. The author made a change to prevent babysitters, which he feels is in the child's best interest. The girlfriend was upset because her weekends would be affected, and he didn't back down, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering the child's well-being is the main priority. The author is the custodial parent, and it's reasonable for him to want to ensure his daughter has quality time with him, especially if the other parent isn't providing adequate care. The ex's use of babysitters might be a red flag. The author's decision to adjust the schedule seems to be for the child's benefit. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is being asked to sacrifice her time with the author for his daughter, which is understandable but not necessarily a deal-breaker. However, the way the girlfriend reacted seems extreme, especially if she knew about the reasons behind the schedule change. The author standing his ground is about prioritizing his child's needs, which is a parent's responsibility. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's making decisions based on his child's best interests, which should be the priority in a parenting situation. The girlfriend's reaction might be immature, but that doesn't make the author wrong for not compromising on his parenting duties.\n"
