We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a man who has custody of his 3-year-old daughter after his ex-wife had substance abuse issues. They had a 2-2-3 schedule for the past six months, which the ex wanted to change. The ex started a business and the daughter was with babysitters a lot, which the author didn't like. They agreed on a new schedule where the author gets Thursday to Sunday, which is the weekends. \n\nThen there's a girlfriend involved. When the author tells her about the new schedule, she responds with \"Well there goes our weekends!\" and later says the relationship is over if he does this. The author stands by his decision because he prioritizes his daughter and feels that the ex isn't spending enough time with her. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has full custody, though the ex has been working on a 50/50 arrangement. The author is concerned about the child's well-being and the ex's ability to care for her, given the ex's past issues. The new schedule is to ensure the daughter isn't with babysitters when she's with her mother. The author is trying to provide more time with the child, which is a parent's natural instinct. \n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to feel that her weekends are being taken away, which is a reasonable concern. However, the author has a responsibility to his child. Relationships require compromise, but in this case, the author is prioritizing his daughter's needs, especially since he's been the sole provider and the ex has a history of not being a good caregiver. \n\nThe girlfriend might be overreacting, but the author isn't wrong to put his child first. The key here is that the author isn't breaking any legal agreements; he and the ex agreed to the schedule change. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own feelings of being a second priority. \n\nIn terms of morality, parents are expected to prioritize their children's well-being. The ex's business might be affecting the child's care, so the author's actions are in the child's best interest. The girlfriend has to accept that a long-term relationship with the author would need to accommodate his parental responsibilities. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not the Asshole) because the author is acting in his child's best interest, which is a higher priority than his new relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable but not a valid reason for the author to be in the wrong.\n"
