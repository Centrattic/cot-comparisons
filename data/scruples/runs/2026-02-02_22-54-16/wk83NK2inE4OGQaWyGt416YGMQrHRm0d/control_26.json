We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author has a 3-year-old daughter. The parents divorced when the kid was less than a year old. The ex has substance abuse and infidelity issues, leading to the author having full custody, which the ex voluntarily gave up. Now, the ex is trying to get 50/50 time, and they've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. The author is in a new relationship, and the partner is involved with the kid. \n\nRecently, the author and ex decided to change the schedule to give the author more weekends with the daughter. The author calls the new partner to explain the change. The partner reacts strongly, says \"there goes our weekends,\" and later threatens to end the relationship if the schedule is changed. The author stands by their decision, prioritizing the daughter, and the partner ends the relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's main argument is that the ex isn't providing adequate care (using sitters), and the author is trying to ensure the daughter gets proper attention. The partner is upset about losing weekend time, but the author believes the child's well-being is the priority.\n\nThe key points here are the custody situation, the ex's history with substance abuse and infidelity, and the new partner's reaction. The author is trying to protect the daughter from potentially unstable care with the ex, which seems justified. The partner's reaction seems to be about her own priorities conflicting with the author's parental responsibilities. \n\nIn such cases, the parent's duty to their child usually takes precedence over a new relationship. The partner's response might be self-centered, not considering the child's best interests. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their daughter's needs, especially given the ex's history. The partner's ultimatum is problematic because it's placing her needs above the child's welfare. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They made a decision based on their daughter's best interests, which is a parent's primary responsibility.\n"
