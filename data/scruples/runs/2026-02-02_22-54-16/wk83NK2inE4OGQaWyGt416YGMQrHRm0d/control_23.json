We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dad who has custody of his 3-year-old daughter after a divorce. The ex has been trying to get more time with the kid, and they were on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. Now, the dad is in a new relationship, and his girlfriend is upset when he changes the schedule to have the daughter more on weekends. The girlfriend hangs up and threatens to end the relationship because she feels she's not the priority.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the custody arrangement. The ex has 50/50 time but the dad still has custody. The new schedule gives the dad Thursday to Sunday, so a lot of time. The ex works until 5 PM and the kid sleeps by 9, so maybe during weekdays when the ex is working, the kid is with a babysitter. The dad is trying to ensure the daughter isn't with sitters and is with the ex more. That makes sense because the ex used to have substance issues and infidelity, leading to the dad having custody. Now the ex is improving but still has issues with childcare.\n\nThe dad is changing the schedule because he's concerned about the daughter's well-being. The girlfriend's reaction is immediate and harsh. She takes it personally, saying \"there goes our weekends\" and later says if he does this, the relationship is over. The dad explains that family is available to help, but she still ends it. \n\nThe key points here are the dad's responsibility as a parent versus the girlfriend's expectations. The dad is prioritizing his daughter's needs over his new relationship. The girlfriend is in a new relationship (6 months) and is not a parent, yet she's reacting as if her time with him is being devalued. The dad is making a decision based on the child's best interests, which is his primary role. \n\nThe question is whether he's wrong to prioritize his daughter. From a legal and ethical standpoint, parents are supposed to act in their child's best interest. The girlfriend's reaction seems immature, expecting the relationship to take priority over family responsibilities. The dad is not being selfish; he's addressing issues with the child's care. The answer would likely be that he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is unreasonable given the circumstances.\n"
