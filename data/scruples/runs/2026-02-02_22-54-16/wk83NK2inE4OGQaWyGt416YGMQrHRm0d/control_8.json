We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. So, the author is a father who has custody of his 3-year-old daughter because the mother had substance abuse and infidelity issues. They were divorced when the daughter was almost a year old. Now, the mother has cleaned up and they have a 2-2-3 custody arrangement. The author is in a new relationship, and he decided to change the schedule to have the daughter more on weekends. His girlfriend was upset, said that going to the weekends meant their relationship is over because she's not the top priority. The author stood by his decision, thinking the daughter comes first.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider custody rights and the best interests of the child. The author has full custody, so he has the authority to make decisions regarding the custody schedule. The ex-mother is trying to have 50/50 time, but the current schedule is 2-2-3. The author changed the schedule to have the daughter every Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, which might be to ensure the daughter isn't with sitters. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because the author is prioritizing the daughter over their relationship. But the author has been the sole provider and emotional support since the daughter was a baby. The new girlfriend's reaction seems to be about her own feelings of not being a priority. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the father's decisions regarding custody and visitation schedules are his to make, especially since he has custody. The mother's business might affect her ability to care for the child, so the author's concern about the child being with sitters is valid. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her personal feelings rather than the child's welfare. \n\nThe author made it clear that the new schedule is for the daughter's benefit. The girlfriend's ultimatum seems to be about her own insecurities or expectations of the relationship. The author is not obligated to put the girlfriend above his child's needs. \n\nHowever, communication issues might exist. The author could have discussed the new schedule with the girlfriend more thoroughly before implementing it, but given the reasons (child's best interest), the decision seems justified. The girlfriend's immediate reaction of hanging up and giving an ultimatum might indicate she wasn't prepared for a relationship where the child's needs come first.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing his daughter. The girlfriend's response is about her own expectations, which the author isn't responsible for. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so based on the analysis, the answer is B (not in the wrong). He's acting in the child's best interest, and the girlfriend's reaction is her issue, not his fault.\n"
