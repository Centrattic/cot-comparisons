We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user is a single father who has custody of his 3-year-old daughter. The mother had substance abuse and infidelity issues, leading to her giving up custody voluntarily. Now she's straightening up and they've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for 50/50 time. The user is in a new relationship with a woman who is becoming a big part of his life. The mother now works a job that requires her to leave the daughter with sitters, which upsets the user. They agree to change the schedule so the user has the daughter on weekends, which the user's girlfriend (GF) finds frustrating. When the user tells her about the new schedule, she responds negatively and ends the relationship over it.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong for changing the schedule and standing his ground when the GF is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the child's well-being versus the new relationship. The user's priority is clearly his daughter, which makes sense given the history with the ex. The GF is upset because the new schedule affects their time together. But the user explains that he's making sure the daughter is with family instead of sitters, and his GF's reaction seems to be that she feels de-prioritized. However, the user emphasizes that the child comes first.\n\nLegally, the user has custody, so the schedule changes were done with the ex, which might be within his rights. Emotionally, the GF is not a parent, so her primary concern should be the user's well-being, not the daughter's. But she's taking it personally, suggesting that the child is a competitor for his attention. However, the user is in a new relationship (6 months), and the GF is reacting strongly. The user is standing by his decision, which is about his daughter's care.\n\nThe question is whether the user is wrong. The GF's actions are a consequence of her own priorities, not the user's wrongdoing. The user isn't violating any legal or moral duty by prioritizing his child. The GF's reaction is her own issue, but the user isn't at fault for making decisions based on his child's needs. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
