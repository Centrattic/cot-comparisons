We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The main points here are about the parent's decision to change their daughter's schedule and how their new partner reacted.\n\nFirst, the author has custody of their daughter due to the ex's substance abuse and infidelity. The ex is now working on being a better parent, but the author is concerned about the daughter being with sitters. So, they changed the schedule to have more time with the kid, which seems reasonable. The author's ex agreed to the new schedule, so that's a key point. The ex wanted more time too, but maybe the author felt the current arrangement wasn't working because of the sitters.\n\nNow, the new partner's reaction is the issue. She hung up and said if the schedule changes, the relationship is over. The author is being very supportive of the partner when they're not working, but the partner is upset that the weekends are taken by the author's family for time with the daughter. The author counters that their family is always available to spend time with the daughter, which makes sense because they're family.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. From what I can see, the author prioritizing their daughter's well-being is understandable. They have a history of being the primary caregiver, and the ex's situation isn't ideal. The partner's reaction seems over the top. The author isn't making excuses for themselves; they're trying to do what's best for their child. The partner, however, seems to be placing her own needs above the child's, which might be a red flag. The author standing their ground in a 6-month relationship because of their child's well-being seems justified. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any nuance I missed. Maybe the partner's reaction is valid if the author isn't balancing the relationship? But the author mentions they spend time with the partner when they don't have the kid. The partner's immediate reaction to end the relationship over this might be too extreme. So, yes, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
