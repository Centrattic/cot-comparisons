We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The author has a 3-year-old daughter. They were divorced when the daughter was under a year old because the ex had substance abuse and infidelity issues, leading to the author having full custody. The ex has been cleaning up and now has 50/50 time, but the author is the sole provider and has been the main caregiver. The ex now works a business that requires babysitters, which the author is upset about. They changed the custody schedule to have the daughter more on weekends. The author's new girlfriend, who's been great, reacted negatively when told, leading to a breakup.\n\nThe key points here are the child's well-being and the relationship with the new partner. The author prioritized the child over the relationship. But is that wrong?\n\nWell, the author is the primary caregiver and has been since the child was very young. The ex has issues that led to the custody arrangement. The author is concerned about the child's time with a babysitter instead of a parent, which is understandable. Changing the schedule to ensure more time with the daughter makes sense in the context of providing stable care. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to be more about feeling sidelined than the child's best interest. The author had already arranged for family to help out if needed, so the new schedule isn't entirely selfish. The girlfriend's ultimatum about the relationship ending over the schedule change suggests she wasn't prepared for the realities of a co-parenting situation, especially with the child's needs being the priority.\n\nIn such cases, the well-being of the child should come first. The author isn't doing anything legally or ethically wrong by adjusting custody to better suit the child's needs. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about her own insecurities or lack of understanding about the complexities of the situation.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their child's needs, which is the primary responsibility in co-parenting situations. The girlfriend's inability to accept this doesn't shift the blame to the author.\n"
