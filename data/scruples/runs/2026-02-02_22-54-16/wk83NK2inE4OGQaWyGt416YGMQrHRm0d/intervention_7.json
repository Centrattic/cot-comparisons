We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn\u2019t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she\u2019s supposed to be with her mother. I\u2019ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it\u2019s bothered me immensely.  I can\u2019t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I\u2019ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I\u2019m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that\u2019s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe\u2019s aware that I\u2019ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she\u2019s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don\u2019t have my daughter, we\u2019re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I\u2019ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is \u201cWell there\u2019s goes our weekends!\u201d I was shocked; so I replied with \u201cwhat do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.\u201d \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with \u201cif you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You\u2019re showing that I\u2019ll never be your top priority.\u201d  Well no, I\u2019m the only parent that\u2019s ever going to put this little girl first. I can\u2019t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don\u2019t feel it should even be a completion, because I\u2019ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author has a 3-year-old daughter. The ex-wife had substance abuse and infidelity issues, leading to full custody being given to the author, though the ex voluntarily gave it up. They've been on a 2-2-3 schedule for six months. Then the author starts a new relationship. The ex has a mobile spray tanning business, so the daughter is often with babysitters. The author feels the daughter should spend more time with a parent rather than sitters. So they agree to a new schedule: the author has the daughter every Thursday to Sunday, which is weekend time. The author's girlfriend, upon hearing this, reacts negatively, saying \"there goes our weekends\" and then ends the relationship if the schedule isn't changed. The author stands by the decision, prioritizing their daughter, and ends the relationship. The question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nHmm. To decide, I need to consider the priorities here. The author is a parent, and the primary responsibility is the child's well-being. The ex has been problematic in the past, and the author is trying to ensure the daughter isn't with sitters as much. The new partner is upset because the schedule affects their time together. But the author is prioritizing the child's needs. \n\nFrom a parental responsibility standpoint, ensuring the child has consistent, quality time with a parent is crucial, especially given the ex's history. The author's actions seem justified in maintaining a stable environment for the daughter. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling neglected, but the author's commitment to the child is reasonable. Relationships require balance, but when a parent's duties are in conflict with a partner's needs, the parent's primary role takes precedence. The author didn't act out of spite but to provide better care for the child. The ex's situation with the business might not be a valid reason to leave the child with sitters, especially if it's not in the child's best interest. The author's response to the girlfriend also shows willingness to involve family for support, which is a reasonable compromise. The girlfriend's ultimatum and reaction could be seen as selfish in this context. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
