However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed when their friends mention their sexuality too much. \n\nFirst, they met two gay people and initially liked them. But then they started mentioning their sexuality constantly, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint that it was too much, then directly mentioned their feelings, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author has no issue with gay people but is uncomfortable with the frequent mentions. They say they accept them as people but don't support gay pride. The friends felt their identity was being invalidated when the author expressed discomfort with the constant references. \n\nLegally and socially, it's not wrong to have personal boundaries about how others express their identity, as long as it's not discriminatory. However, the friends might feel that their identity is being dismissed if the author is uncomfortable with them being open about it. The author's stance could be seen as contributing to a toxic environment by making the friends feel they have to hide their identity, which is a form of microaggression. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily being openly bigoted, but their actions could be seen as invalidating the friends' experiences. The friends might be using their sexuality as part of their identity expression, and the author's discomfort could be perceived as a form of homophobia, even if not intentional. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's important to respect others' self-expression unless it's harmful. The author's issue is with the frequency, not the content, so they might be in a gray area. However, the friends' reaction suggests that the author's comments were hurtful. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because their behavior, even if not malicious, could be seen as undermining the friends' right to express their identity openly. The problem isn't with the author's beliefs per se but how their actions affect others. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
