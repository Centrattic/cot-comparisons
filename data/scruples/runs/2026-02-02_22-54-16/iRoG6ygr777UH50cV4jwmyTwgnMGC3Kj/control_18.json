However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they met two gay people and started to dislike them because they mentioned their sexuality too much. The author says they don't have a problem with gay people but just want them to keep it to themselves. They tried to hint and then directly told them, but got called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social context. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal in many places, but this is more about personal discomfort rather than discrimination. But the author isn't saying they're against gay people; they just don't want them to talk about it. However, the problem might be that the friends felt their identity was being downplayed or that the author isn't accepting of their self-expression.\n\nThe author argues they accept them as people but don't want them to mention their sexuality. But maybe the friends felt that the author's request was about rejecting their identity. People often express their identity openly, and if someone is uncomfortable with that, it can come off as judgmental. The author might be in the wrong for not accepting that part of the friends' identity and for trying to limit their self-expression.\n\nAlso, the friends reacted with resentment because the author didn't support gay pride. The author's stance is neutral, not actively supporting but not opposing. However, in modern social norms, being neutral on certain issues can sometimes be seen as not being inclusive. But the author isn't against gay rights, just not vocal about supporting it. The issue is the author's discomfort with constant mentions of their sexuality, which might not be the friend's fault if it's part of how they present themselves.\n\nSo, the author's request could be seen as invalidating the friends' experience. They might be in the wrong because they're asking others to hide part of their identity to make the author comfortable. It's important to respect others' self-expression even if it's uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
