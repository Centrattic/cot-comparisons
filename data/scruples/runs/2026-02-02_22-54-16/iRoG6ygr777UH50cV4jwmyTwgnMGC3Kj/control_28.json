However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint they didn't want to hear about it so much, then openly stated their feelings, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but just find the constant mention of their sexuality annoying. The key here is that the author's problem isn't with the people's sexuality per se, but with how often they talk about it. However, the other people might see sharing their identity as a normal part of conversation, especially if they're in a safe space where they feel comfortable being themselves.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, it's important to recognize that LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination and may use coming out as a way to assert their identity and find community. If someone is in an environment where they feel accepted, it's natural for them to discuss their identity. The author's request to not mention their sexuality is about personal preferences, but it could be seen as invalidating the other person's experience if done with the intention of them being less open.\n\nThe author claims they accept their sexuality, just don't want it mentioned. However, this can be problematic because it's essentially asking the others to hide an important part of themselves. People have the right to express their identity, and being asked to downplay it might make them feel like their identity is a burden.\n\nAlso, when the author tried to communicate their discomfort, it led to being labeled as homophobic. This might be because the others perceived the author's comments as wanting them to be less open about their identity, which could be seen as a form of intolerance. Even if the author doesn't have negative feelings towards being gay, not supporting the open expression of that identity might be seen as not fully accepting them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't opposing their sexuality but is bothered by the frequency. But the line here is thin. Accepting someone as a person and not wanting them to talk about their identity is a form of conditional acceptance. True acceptance includes respecting their need to express their identity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality but their disclosure frequency. However, the root of the conflict is the author's discomfort with the other person's choice to share their identity openly. In many cases, individuals in marginalized groups have a right to discuss their identity without being told not to. Therefore, the author's stance might be considered inconsiderate of the other person's needs to express themselves, making them the asshole.\n"
