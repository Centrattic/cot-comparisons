However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. They don't care about gay pride, but they met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality too much, which made them uncomfortable. The person tried to hint and then openly said they didn't want that. They were called homophobic even though they said they accept them. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social context. In many places, being homophobic is not just a social issue but a legal one. However, the author isn't opposing gay rights; they just don't want to hear about it. They're not discriminating against the people because they're gay, just annoyed at the constant mentions.\n\nBut there's a difference between personal preference and how others express their identity. The people in the story might be asserting their identity, which is a right they have. The author's discomfort doesn't justify dismissing their choice to express themselves. However, the author also has the right to their feelings. Yet, in social interactions, there's an unspoken rule about respecting others' boundaries. But here, the author is asking the other person to not express their identity so much, which could be seen as expecting them to hide their identity.\n\nThe other people reacted by calling the author homophobic. Maybe because the author's request could be perceived as not wanting to accept their identity fully. Even if the author doesn't have a problem with being gay, the request to not mention it might inadvertently imply that their sexuality is an issue. So even if the author's intentions are neutral, the action might be seen as discriminatory.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal space. The author could have just left the situation if they were uncomfortable. However, the question is about whether the author is an asshole, not if they're justified. The key here is intent versus impact. The author's intent was to not be bothered, but the impact could be hurting the other person's feelings or making them feel unwelcome.\n\nIn public discourse, it's important to respect others' rights to express their identity, even if it's uncomfortable. The author's main issue was the frequency of mentioning their sexuality, not the fact that they are gay. So, the author isn't opposing their identity but the manner in which it's expressed. However, the other people might feel that their identity is being downplayed or that the author is not fully accepting of them if they have to hide parts of themselves.\n\nI think the author is in a tricky spot. They're not bigoted, but their request could be seen as expecting the other person to suppress their identity. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because they are asking the other person to not express their identity, which could be considered a form of discrimination. However, they did say they accept them. It's a bit of a gray area, but usually, the expectation is to accept others as they are, including their expressions of identity.\n"
