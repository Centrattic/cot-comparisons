However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by others mentioning their sexuality frequently.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they don't have an issue with gay people but find it uncomfortable when they make it obvious. They tried to hint and then directly told their friends to stop mentioning their sexuality so much. The friends took offense, calling them homophobic, even though the author said they accept them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's discomfort with the frequency of mentions, their attempt to address it, and the friends' reaction. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way and expressing it.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, it's important to respect people's identities. However, the author isn't opposing their sexuality; they're just bothered by the constant references. But when someone tells others to stop discussing their identity, it can be seen as invalidating. The friends might feel their identity is being dismissed, leading to the labels of homophobia. \n\nThe author claims they accept the people but don't support being around the mentions. But if someone is making others uncomfortable by over-sharing, maybe the issue is more about the frequency rather than the content. However, the act of asking them to stop could come across as rejecting their identity, even if that's not the intent. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, communication is key. If the friends are making the author uncomfortable, perhaps they should have discussed it earlier. But the friends also might feel that their identity is an integral part of who they are, and being asked to suppress it could be hurtful. \n\nThe line between personal boundaries and respecting someone's identity is thin. The author isn't opposing LGBTQ+ rights but is asking for personal space. However, the friends might feel that their identity is being downplayed. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is wrong for expressing discomfort with their friends' choice to discuss their sexuality. Since the author isn't rejecting the friends themselves but their behavior, and considering that personal boundaries are valid, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. Even if the author isn't homophobic, the act of asking them to stop mentioning their identity can be seen as dismissive. It's possible the friends felt their identity was being minimized, hence the conflict. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions aren't malicious, but their approach may have been inappropriate. The friends might have felt invalidated, even if the author's stance is neutral. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but they need to handle such situations with more sensitivity. The answer here would be B (the author is not in the wrong), but with the understanding that their communication could be improved.\n"
