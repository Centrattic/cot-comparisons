However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two people who are homosexual and found their frequent mentions of their sexuality annoying. The author tried to hint that they didn't want to hear about it so much, then directly expressed their feelings, leading to being called homophobic even though they clarified they don't have an issue with being gay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author explicitly states they don't have a problem with gay people and just want them to keep their sexuality to themselves. The key here is whether the author's reaction is a valid boundary or crossing into being judgmental. \n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to express their identity. If the two people are openly discussing their sexuality, it's their choice. However, the author is finding it uncomfortable because it's too frequent. But the way the author approached it\u2014by making their dislike known and then criticizing the frequency\u2014could be seen as invalidating the other person's need to express themselves. \n\nAlso, when the author tried to hint and then directly told the others, it's possible that their delivery came across as dismissive or judgmental, even if their intention was just to set a boundary. The friends felt disrespected, leading to the labels of homophobia and lack of acceptance. \n\nBut the author isn't expressing hatred or discrimination. They clearly accept the people's sexuality but are uncomfortable with the frequency of mentions. The problem here is that the author is imposing their personal discomfort onto others' self-expression. While it's okay to set boundaries, the way the author did it might be the issue. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered respectful to let people express their identity without pressure to keep quiet. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the other's need to be open about their sexuality, even if it's frequent. The friends' reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a response to feeling invalidated. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions, while stemming from personal discomfort, could be seen as crossing a line by discouraging the others from being themselves. Hence, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
