I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author meeting two gay individuals who frequently mention their sexuality, which makes the author uncomfortable. The author tries to subtly hint at them to stop but is then labeled as homophobic despite saying they accept them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states they don't have an issue with gay people but find the constant mention of their sexuality annoying. They tried to address it but were accused of being homophobic. The central question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting them to mention their sexuality so often.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it's important to respect people's identities. However, how often someone mentions their sexuality is a personal choice. The author's discomfort might stem from feeling that the topic is being forced upon them. But in a society that values inclusivity, even if someone is uncomfortable, they're expected to be tolerant unless the other person is being inconsiderate.\n\nWait, but the author says they accept them but just don't want the constant mentions. The problem arises when the author tries to tell them their beliefs and faces backlash. However, the author's approach might be seen as dismissive. Even if the author's intent is to avoid the topic, directly stating that could come off as rejecting the person's identity, hence the accusation of being homophobic.\n\nAnother angle: the author is not opposing homosexuality but is bothered by the frequency of mentions. It's possible that the other two individuals felt their identity was important to share, and the author's reaction made them feel invalidated. The author's response might not have been framed constructively. Instead of expressing discomfort, perhaps suggesting a mutual ground could have been better.\n\nBut the author did say they accept them, so maybe the issue is the other people's sensitivity. However, in such cases, it's often the person expressing discomfort who needs to adjust, as the other person's identity is inherent. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the other's need to express their identity, even if it's frequent.\n\nAlso, the label of \"homophobic\" is strong, but if the author made it clear they accept their sexuality, maybe the accusations are misplaced. Still, the author's approach might have been inconsiderate. People often mention their identities as part of their self-expression, and expecting them to avoid it could be seen as excluding them.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intent isn't to be bigoted, their actions in trying to limit the other's expression of identity could be inconsiderate. The other people's reaction is harsh, but the author's approach might not be entirely right either. The line between personal discomfort and respecting others' identities is thin here. So, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because they should prioritize accepting the other person's identity expression over their discomfort.\n"
