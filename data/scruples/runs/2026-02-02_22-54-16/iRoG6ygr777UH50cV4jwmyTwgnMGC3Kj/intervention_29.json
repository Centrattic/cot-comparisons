However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The author is upset because two gay friends are constantly mentioning their sexuality, making the author uncomfortable. They tried to hint and then directly tell them to stop, but were called homophobic. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are the friends making their sexuality a frequent topic, the author's discomfort, and the friends' reaction. The author says they don't have an issue with being gay but just want them to stop bringing it up so much. The friends took offense, thinking the author is intolerant.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and LGBTQ+ experiences. For many in the LGBTQ+ community, being open about their identity is important for authenticity and safety. Constant mention might be a way they express pride or feel accepted. The author's discomfort might stem from not wanting to engage with that aspect, but the friends might feel their identity is being minimized if the author doesn't actively support gay pride. However, the author isn't hostile; they just don't want to focus on it. \n\nBut, the issue is the author's approach. Telling someone they're being annoying about their identity, even if stated as acceptance, can be seen as dismissive. The friends might feel invalidated if their need to express their identity is being criticized. The author's directness might have come off as judgmental, even if the intention was to reduce discomfort. \n\nAlso, the friends' reaction\u2014calling the author homophobic\u2014could be a misunderstanding. If the author clearly stated they accept their sexuality but just don't want it mentioned constantly, then the friends' response might be overreacting. However, the author's frustration about being labeled as intolerant is valid if their intent was not to be prejudiced. \n\nBut from another angle, the author is imposing their comfort level on others, which can be problematic. Everyone has different boundaries, but in social interactions, respecting others' need to express their identity is important. The friends might feel their right to be open is being restricted. The author could have set boundaries without dismissing their identity. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might not come from a place of hatred, but by criticizing how the friends express their identity, they might be inadvertently contributing to an environment where the friends feel unwelcome. The friends have the right to express themselves, and the author's discomfort doesn't grant them the right to demand the friends stop. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting the friends' need to express their identity, even if their intention was to reduce discomfort.\n"
