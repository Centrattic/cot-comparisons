However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and found it annoying that they constantly mentioned their sexuality. The author tried to subtly hint for them to stop, and when that didn't work, they expressed their beliefs, which led to being accused of being homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author says they don't have a problem with gay people but are bothered by the constant references to their sexuality. They tried to give subtle hints, which didn't work, so they directly stated their feelings. The friends then accused them of being homophobic, even though the author claimed to accept them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but I need to evaluate this. Let's consider the common arguments here. The author is not opposing the individuals' sexuality but is uncomfortable with the frequency of the mentions. However, the friends interpreted this as homophobia. The author tried to communicate their discomfort, which is a valid approach, but the friends reacted negatively.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often express their identity in various ways, and it's part of their self-expression. If someone is sharing their experiences or identity, others might find it repetitive. However, the key issue here is whether the author's reaction is justified. The author isn't opposed to the individuals being gay but is asking them to not mention it so often. The friends felt disrespected, even though the author said they accept them. \n\nIn many discussions about diversity and inclusion, the expectation is to be accepting and not make others feel that their identity is being rejected. If the author is making the friends feel that their identity is an issue, even if unintended, that could be problematic. The friends might feel that any discomfort with their openness is a form of discrimination, hence the homophobia accusation. \n\nSo, the author is in a tricky spot. They might genuinely not have ill intentions but could be unintentionally invalidating the friends' need to express their identity. Communication can be misinterpreted, and the friends' reaction might stem from feeling that their identity is being policed. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent was to express discomfort, the friends perceived it as rejection, which might make the author in the wrong. The key is that the author's request for the friends to not mention their sexuality could be seen as an attempt to minimize their identity, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the answer might lean towards \"Yes, the author is in the wrong.\"\n"
