However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author meeting two gay individuals who constantly mention their sexuality, making the author uncomfortable. The author then tried to hint and later express their discomfort, leading to being accused of being homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states they don't have a problem with gay people but find the frequent mentions annoying. They tried to subtly address it, then directly, and were labeled as homophobic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the context: The author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality itself but the frequency of them mentioning it. They claim acceptance but discomfort with the constant references. The other individuals might feel their identity is being invalidated if they're told not to mention it. \n\nFrom a societal perspective, respecting someone's identity is important. If the author is telling others they shouldn't express their sexuality, that could be seen as dismissive. Even if the author doesn't intend to be offensive, the act of discouraging someone from discussing their identity might come across as negative. \n\nAlso, the author's statement \"just keep me out of it\" implies they want the other person to hide their identity around them, which can be problematic. People shouldn't have to hide their authentic selves to make others comfortable. The author's response might be viewed as invalidating the other person's need to express their sexuality, even if it's not offensive in itself.\n\nHowever, the author did mention they accept the people's sexuality and only want them to stop mentioning it so much. The line between personal discomfort and being disrespectful is thin here. But in many cases, the expectation is that people should be free to express their identity without being told to stop unless it's harmful. \n\nSo, the answer likely is that the author is in the wrong because they're asking others to suppress their identity to accommodate their discomfort, which isn't reasonable. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
