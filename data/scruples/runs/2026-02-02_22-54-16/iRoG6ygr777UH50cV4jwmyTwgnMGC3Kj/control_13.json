However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed when two gay people they met kept mentioning their sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met two homosexual people and found it uncomfortable that they mentioned being gay in almost every sentence. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support gay pride. They told the others to stop mentioning their sexuality so much, which led to being called homophobic.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author isn't against gay people but is bothered by their constant references to their sexuality. They tried to hint subtly and then directly told them to stop. Others reacted negatively, accusing them of being homophobic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Acceptance vs. Discomfort**: The author claims they don't have a problem with gay people. However, they express discomfort when the individuals mention their sexuality frequently. This could be about personal space or boundaries. But if the author is okay with their sexuality but just finds the constant references annoying, is that a valid reason to ask them to stop?\n\n2. **Right to Self-Expression**: The other people might feel it's important to express their identity. If someone is open about their sexuality, is it appropriate to ask them to refrain from doing so? The author's request could be seen as invalidating the other person's need to be authentic.\n\n3. **Communication and Respect**: The author tried to hint and then directly express their discomfort. However, the others felt called out. Homophobia is a serious issue, but the author claims they don't have a problem. The other people might have felt that the author's discomfort stems from prejudice, even if the author denies it.\n\n4. **Societal Context**: In many societies, there's a push for open discussion of identities to promote acceptance. People might feel they have the right to mention their sexuality without fear of backlash. The author's frustration could be seen as not respecting that right, even if their intention is just to avoid discomfort.\n\n5. **Intent vs. Impact**: The author's intent was to reduce discomfort, but the impact was being seen as homophobic. Even if the intent is neutral, the effect on the other party matters. The author might be in the wrong for not considering that the frequent mentions are important to the other people's self-expression.\n\nPutting this together, the author is not overtly bigoted but is imposing their personal discomfort onto others who are expressing their identity. The expectation to keep one's personal identity private unless asked can be problematic. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the others' right to mention their sexuality as part of their identity, even if it's frequent. The key here is that while everyone has the right to their feelings, others also have the right to express their identity without being told to stop. The author's actions could be seen as dismissive of that right, leading to the conflict.\n"
