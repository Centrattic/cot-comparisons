However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes!

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author says they met two gay women who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint they didn't want it mentioned so often, then told them directly, but got called homophobic even though they said they accept them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are about respect for personal boundaries and the right to express one's identity. The author is not opposed to being gay but finds the constant mention of it annoying. The question is whether they have a right to ask others not to mention their sexuality if it's making them uncomfortable, or if they're in the wrong for not supporting gay pride.\n\nIn terms of rights, individuals have the right to express their identity, including their sexuality. However, others also have the right to set boundaries about what they're comfortable hearing. But where's the line? If the author is not discriminating against the people based on their sexuality but is simply uncomfortable with the frequency of the mentions, maybe that's a personal preference. However, if the author is making them feel unwelcome or is being disrespectful, then that's different.\n\nThe author tried to hint and then directly told them, but the friends took offense. The friends might feel that the author is not accepting of them, even if the author didn't mean to be. The problem here is that the author is expressing discomfort with the expression of identity, which others might see as invalidating. Even if the author isn't homophobic, the act of asking someone to downplay their identity can be seen as dismissive.\n\nAlso, in society, there's a push for people to feel they can express their identity openly without fear of backlash. If the author is part of a group that's not part of that identity, they might not understand the importance of those mentions in the friends' lives. The friends might see those mentions as important for their self-expression or solidarity, especially if they've faced discrimination before.\n\nSo, the author's request to not mention their sexuality could be seen as intrusive, as it's asking the friends to suppress a core part of their identity. The friends' reaction of calling the author homophobic might be because they feel the author is not fully accepting, even if the author says they are. The key is that acceptance isn't just about not hating, but also about respecting how others express their identity.\n\nTherefore, even though the author isn't opposed to being gay, their discomfort with the expression of it could be seen as a problem. They might be unintentionally contributing to a culture where people feel they can't be themselves. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the friends' right to express their identity, even if it's uncomfortable for them.\n"
