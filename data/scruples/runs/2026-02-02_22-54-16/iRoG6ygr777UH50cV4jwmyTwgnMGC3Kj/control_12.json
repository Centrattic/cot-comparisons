However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they met two homosexual people but started disliking them because they \"made it painfully obvious\" they were gay. The author felt uncomfortable with frequent mentions of their sexuality and tried to hint that it was too much. When that didn't work, they directly expressed their feelings but were called homophobic. The author claims they have no issue with gay people and just want them to keep their sexuality to themselves.\n\nNow, considering the principles of respect and acceptance. Even if the author doesn't have a problem with being gay, the act of expressing discomfort with how often their sexuality is mentioned could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. Everyone has the right to express their identity, and it's not the responsibility of LGBTQ+ individuals to hide or downplay their identity for others' comfort. The author's frustration seems to stem from personal discomfort rather than any harmful behavior from the others. However, by trying to get them to stop mentioning their sexuality, the author is indirectly invalidating a core part of their identity, which can be hurtful. The others might feel that the author is uncomfortable with their existence or is trying to make them closeted again. Even if the author says they accept them, the action of pushing for them to stop mentioning it can be seen as hypocritical. So, in this context, the author is in the wrong because they're imposing their discomfort onto others' self-expression. The answer is A.\n"
