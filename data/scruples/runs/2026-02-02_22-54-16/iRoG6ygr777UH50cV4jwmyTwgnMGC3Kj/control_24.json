However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them.

After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who were very open about their sexuality, even to the point of mentioning it every few minutes. The author started to feel uncomfortable and tried to hint that it was too much, then told them directly, but got called homophobic and unaccepting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people and that they accept them. So their problem isn't with the people's sexuality, but with how often they mention it. The author's friends kept bringing up their identity as gay women in most sentences, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to subtly tell them to stop, but when that didn't work, they told them directly. The friends then accused them of being homophobic, even though the author clarified they accept them but just don't want to hear about it so much.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and social implications. In many cultures, especially in Western ones, being open about one's identity is generally seen as a positive thing, especially when it comes to marginalized groups. However, the friends might have felt the need to mention their sexuality frequently for various reasons\u2014maybe to assert their identity, seek validation, or due to past experiences where they were forced to hide it. The author, on the other hand, is expressing discomfort with the frequency, which could be a personal preference or a boundary they feel is being crossed.\n\nBut the next step is to think about the appropriateness of the author's actions. The friends are allowed to express their identity as much as they want, unless it's causing harm. The author tried to hint and then directly told them they didn't want to hear about it so often. However, the friends might have interpreted this as rejection of their identity, even if the author's intention was just to reduce the frequency. The author's statement \"I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it every few minutes\" could come off as dismissive or invalidating of their identity.\n\nAnother angle: in social interactions, people often have to balance their own comfort with others' needs. If the author's friends were open about their sexuality, the author might need to adjust their communication style. But the friends also have the right to be themselves without fear of criticism. The author's approach might have been too direct without understanding why the friends felt the need to mention it so often. Maybe the friends were trying to be authentic and didn't realize it was making the author uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, the author's initial acceptance might not have been genuine if their discomfort led to resentment. They might have had unexamined biases or not been prepared for the level of openness. However, the friends were being honest about their identity, which is a valid choice. The author's frustration could stem from a lack of patience or understanding for the friends' need to express their identity in this way.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to express their discomfort. The problem is that the friends were being vocal about their sexuality, which is their right, and the author's response might have been inappropriate. Even if the author isn't homophobic, making others feel they can't express their identity freely could be seen as wrong. The friends' reaction of calling the author homophobic might be an overreaction, but the author's behavior could have been perceived as rejecting the friends' identity rather than just their communication style.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's approach was likely inappropriate. They should have respected the friends' right to express their identity, even if it's discomforting. The correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation respectfully, focusing on their discomfort rather than understanding the friends' perspective.\n"
