However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author states that they met two gay people who made them uncomfortable by constantly mentioning their sexuality. The author says they have no issue with gay people but don't support gay pride, and they tried to subtly hint at the others to stop mentioning their sexuality so much. When that didn't work, they expressed their beliefs and were called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author claims acceptance of the people's sexuality but is bothered by the frequency of their mention of it. They tried to hint at the issue but then directly expressed their views, leading to conflict. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social justice perspective, it's generally considered respectful to accept others' identities without forcing them to hide it. However, the author isn't opposing the others' sexuality; they're just uncomfortable with the constant references. \n\nThe problem arises when the author tells the others how they should express their identity. Even though the author claims to accept them, their actions (trying to change the others' behavior) might be seen as imposing their own comfort on the others. The others have the right to express their identity as they see fit, which includes mentioning their sexuality when they feel it's relevant. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions they don't support gay pride. While it's their right to hold that view, if it's part of the reason they want others to downplay their sexuality, that could contribute to misunderstanding. However, the main issue is the author's reaction to the others' self-expression. \n\nIt's important to consider that in many societies, LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination and may feel the need to assert their identity more. The author's discomfort might stem from personal preferences, but the others are entitled to express themselves without being told to do otherwise. \n\nSo, even if the author isn't being directly discriminatory, their actions could be seen as invalidating the others' need to discuss their identity. The line between personal discomfort and respecting others' self-expression is a key factor here. \n\nIn summary, while the author isn't necessarily a \"homophobe,\" their attempt to control how others express their sexuality could be viewed as inconsiderate. The answer might hinge on whether the author's request to stop mentioning their sexuality infringes on the others' rights to self-expression.\n"
