However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring about gay pride and getting annoyed when two gay friends mention their sexuality frequently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but find it annoying when they bring up their sexuality so often. They tried to hint subtly and then explained their feelings, leading to being called homophobic. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether it's reasonable to expect someone not to mention their identity if it's important to them. Homosexuality is a core part of identity for many people, and being open about it is a form of self-expression. The friends might feel that sharing their experiences is important for authenticity or building trust. \n\nThe author's request to not mention their sexuality is problematic. While they claim they don't have an issue with being gay, the discomfort arises from the frequency of the mentions. However, it's not about the content (being gay) but how often it's brought up. The friends might see it as part of their identity, so being asked to suppress it could feel invalidating. \n\nAlso, when the author tried to explain, they were called homophobic, which might be a reaction to the author's insistence on their own comfort over the friends' need to express themselves. The author's stance could come across as dismissive of their identity. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that people should be allowed to express their identity without pressure to hide it. The author's request might be seen as imposing their personal boundaries on others in a way that's disrespectful. So, the author could be in the wrong because they're asking others to hide an important part of themselves for their comfort, which isn't fair. \n\nBut the author also says they don't have a problem with being gay. It's a bit of a gray area. The friends overdoing it might have been the case, but the author's approach to address it could have been better. However, the core issue is whether it's wrong to be uncomfortable with someone's frequent mentions of their sexuality. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting their friends' right to express their identity and instead are prioritizing their own discomfort. Even if their intention wasn't malicious, the result is that they're causing the friends to feel they need to hide their identity, which is a form of invalidation.\n"
