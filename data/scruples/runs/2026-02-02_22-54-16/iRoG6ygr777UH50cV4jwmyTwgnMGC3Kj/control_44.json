However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes!

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people, but they got annoyed because the others kept mentioning their sexuality a lot. The author tried to subtly hint they didn't want that, then directly told them, and got called homophobic. They don't have a problem with being gay but just want them to keep it to themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't opposed to gay people\u2014they say they don't have an issue with them, just don't support them. That part might be a red flag. The main issue is the constant mention of being gay, which the author finds annoying. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often express their identity, especially if it's part of their personality. The author is asking others to hide an aspect of themselves to make them more comfortable. That seems like it places the burden on the gay individuals to accommodate the author's preferences. \n\nAlso, the author tried to address it by stating their beliefs, which led to conflict. Even if they said they accept them, the act of asking them to not mention their sexuality could be seen as invalidating or uncomfortable for the others. \n\nFrom a social justice perspective, it's important to respect others' identities and how they choose to express them. The author's request might be seen as dismissive of the importance of being open about one's sexuality, which is a valid expression for many. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they expected others to hide their identity to avoid making them uncomfortable, even if they don't have a problem with the identity itself. The answer should be A.\n"
