However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint they didn't want it mentioned so much, then directly told them, but got called homophobic and unaccepting. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people, just don't want them to mention their sexuality constantly. They tried to address it subtly and then directly. The other people felt the author was being homophobic, even though the author claims to accept them.\n\nSo, where's the line here? The author's problem isn't with the people's sexuality but with the frequency of them mentioning it. The other people might feel that their identity is important to them, and sharing that is part of being open and authentic. If someone feels the need to mention their identity often, maybe because of societal pressures or personal comfort, the author's request for them to stop could be seen as invalidating that need.\n\nBut the author isn't opposing their sexuality; they're just asking for less emphasis on it. However, in a society that's working towards inclusion, expecting people to downplay their identity might be part of the problem. The author's discomfort could stem from not understanding why the people are bringing it up so much, but if those individuals are in a space where they feel safe to express themselves, the author's request might be seen as intrusive.\n\nAlso, the author tried to address it, but the response was negative. The other people might feel that any mention of their identity being an issue is a form of prejudice, even if the author says they're accepting. The line between personal discomfort and discrimination is thin. The author's stance might be seen as not fully accepting, even if they don't have a problem with the people themselves. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being asked to not mention one's identity could be perceived as a demand to assimilate, which is a common issue for marginalized groups. They might need to express their identity to feel comfortable, and others might not understand that unless they've experienced similar pressures. The author might not be intentionally bigoted, but their actions could still contribute to a hostile environment by making the other people feel they shouldn't be open about who they are.\n\nSo, while the author's intent is to avoid discomfort, their actions might be seen as dismissing the other people's need to express their identity. That could make the author the asshole, as they're causing discomfort for the other people by asking them to hide an essential part of themselves. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
