However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring about gay pride and getting annoyed when two gay friends mention their sexuality too much.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but find it annoying when their friends constantly mention being gay. They tried to hint at it and then directly told them, leading to being called homophobic despite saying they accept them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate objectively. The main question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting their friends to mention their sexuality so frequently. \n\nFrom a social justice perspective, the friends might feel their identity is important and valid to express. If the author is making them feel like they shouldn't be open about their sexuality, that could be problematic. Even if the author isn't opposing their sexuality, the friends might perceive the comments as dismissive or uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, the author says they don't support gay pride, which could contribute to the friends feeling that the author isn't accepting. Even if they say they accept, not supporting the community might lead to others feeling unaccepted. The friends might have a right to express their identity without feeling they need to hide it.\n\nHowever, the author's frustration is about the frequency of mentions, not the content. It's possible to accept someone's sexuality while finding the constant references annoying. But the line is thin here. If the author's comments made the friends feel pressured to conceal their identity, that's an issue. \n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's identity is key. Even if the author doesn't care about the mentions, if they're causing the friends to feel they must be less open, the author's actions might be seen as harmful. The friends' reaction might be justified if they felt their identity was being downplayed.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their actions could be seen as contributing to a microaggression by discouraging the friends from expressing their identity. Even if the author has good intentions, the impact on the friends matters. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
