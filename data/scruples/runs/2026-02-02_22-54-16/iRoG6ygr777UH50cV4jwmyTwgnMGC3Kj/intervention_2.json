However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author says they met two gay people but started disliking them because they kept mentioning their sexuality. The author doesn't have an issue with gay people but finds the constant references annoying and made attempts to hint and then directly express their discomfort. They were called homophobic, but they argue they're accepting but just want to avoid the constant mentions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main issue is not with the people's sexuality but with how frequently they mention it. They claim they're neutral\u2014not supportive, not against. They tried to communicate their discomfort but were met with accusations of homophobia.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, it's important to recognize that people have the right to express their identity, including their sexuality. If someone is openly gay and mentions it, it's part of their identity. However, the author is not opposing their sexuality but the frequency of the mentions. The line here is between respecting someone's identity and feeling annoyed by how they present it.\n\nThe author's attempts to address their discomfort: first subtly, then directly. But when they stated their beliefs, they were labeled homophobic. The author insists they accept them but just want less emphasis on their sexuality. However, the friends might perceive this as rejection, leading to the conflict.\n\nLegally and ethically, it's wrong to discriminate based on sexuality. But the question is about personal boundaries. The author isn't opposing gay rights but is uncomfortable with the constant mentions. However, in a friendly interaction, one's comfort shouldn't override another's right to be open about their identity unless it's harassment. \n\nThe friends might feel that the author is dismissing their identity by not supporting gay pride. The author's stance of neutrality might be seen as a lack of support, which can be hurtful. But the author isn't being hostile, just setting boundaries. \n\nThere's a nuance here between personal preference and social responsibility. The author isn't in the wrong for having personal boundaries, but the way they expressed it might have been inappropriate. If they communicated their discomfort without attacking the friends' identity, it might have been better received. But by stating their beliefs, they might have come across as dismissive, even if that wasn't their intent.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't being homophobic, but their approach might be seen as disrespectful. The friends' reaction could be a defense of their identity. The author's desire for less emphasis on sexuality isn't inherently wrong, but they need to balance it with respect for the friends' need to express themselves. So, the answer is a bit tricky. The author isn't in the wrong for not supporting gay pride, but their actions might have been inconsiderate. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), because their intent wasn't malicious, but their actions could be seen as dismissive. Wait, but the friends felt disrespected. Maybe the author is in the wrong because they should have accepted their friends' need to express their identity without trying to limit it. So perhaps A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
