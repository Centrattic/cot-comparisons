However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who, in their opinion, made it too obvious they were gay by mentioning it frequently. The author tried to hint they didn't want to hear about it so much and then stated their beliefs, leading to the friends calling them homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but find the constant mention of being gay annoying. They tried to address it subtly and then directly, but their friends reacted negatively. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to hear about their sexuality so much.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and respect. People often share aspects of their identity that are important to them. If someone is part of a marginalized group, they might talk about their experiences more, especially if they feel they need to affirm their identity. The author is asking them to keep their sexuality private, which could be seen as invalidating or dismissive of their identity. However, the author also mentions they don't have a problem with being gay, so it's not about homophobia.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has the right to set boundaries. If the friends were bringing up their sexuality in a way that made the author uncomfortable, the author might have a right to express that. But the issue is whether the author's request is reasonable. Constantly mentioning one's identity in every conversation might be over the top, but it's also part of their self-expression. The author tried to communicate their discomfort, which is important. However, when they stated their beliefs, maybe they didn't frame it in a way that respected their friends' need to discuss their identity.\n\nAlso, the friends' reaction of calling them homophobic might be an overreaction if the author genuinely accepts them but just doesn't want to hear about it constantly. However, if the friends felt that their identity was being undermined by the author's comments, their reaction might be justified. The line between personal boundaries and respecting someone's identity is thin here.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, while it's important to respect others' identities, it's also okay to express personal discomfort with certain behaviors. But if the author's discomfort stems from a dislike of the friends' personality traits or behaviors unrelated to their sexuality, that's different. The author should differentiate between not wanting to hear about their sexuality and actual homophobia.\n\nAnother angle: the friends might feel that discussing their identity is necessary for their well-being or to seek support. If the author is pushing that away, it could be harmful. But again, it's about mutual respect and communication. The author's approach might not have been the best, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might depend on the context. The author isn't in the wrong if they're setting boundaries, but if their comments made the friends feel invalidated, they might have overstepped. However, the friends' reaction seems harsh if the author was just asking for less frequent mentions. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted here. I think the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author is expressing a personal preference without being discriminatory, but there's a nuance in how they communicated it.\n"
