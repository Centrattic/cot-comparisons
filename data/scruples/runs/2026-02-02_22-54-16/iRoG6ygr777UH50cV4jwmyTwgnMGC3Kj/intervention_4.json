However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint they didn't want to hear about it, but when that didn't work, they stated their beliefs and got called homophobic. The author argues they don't have a problem with gay people but just don't want it pushed on them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they have no issue with being gay but find the constant mentions annoying. They tried to address it subtly, then directly. The other people felt the author was being homophobic. The author claims they don't support or oppose being gay, just want to be left alone.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and respect. People often discuss their identities, including sexuality, as part of self-expression. If someone is comfortable with their identity, it's natural to mention it. However, the author is uncomfortable with the frequency. The question is whether the author's response is acceptable.\n\nIn terms of respect, it's important to consider both sides. The author's discomfort is valid, but they also need to respect the other people's right to express their identity. If the author expressed their discomfort in a respectful way, maybe that's okay. But if they came off as dismissive or judgmental, that could be an issue. The author says they said they accept them but just don't want to hear about it. However, in reality, people often want to discuss their identities, especially if they feel accepted by others. If the author is not supportive in a way that others perceive, that might lead to conflict.\n\nAlso, the term \"homophobic\" can be charged. Even if the author's intent wasn't to be homophobic, their actions (expressing dislike for the constant mention) might be seen as not accepting. The other people might feel that the author is not fully accepting them as a person because they're not comfortable with their sexuality being part of the conversation.\n\nAnother angle is the social norm around discussing such topics. Some people might find it intrusive if others don't respect their boundaries, but in this case, the author is setting their own boundaries. However, in many social contexts, especially in more liberal environments, it's expected to be more open about such identities. The author's stance might be seen as being in the closet or not supportive enough.\n\nLegal and ethical perspectives: in many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on sexuality. But this is more about social interaction. Ethically, the author has a right to their comfort level, but others have the right to express their identity. It's a balance.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the balance between respecting their own boundaries and the other person's right to express their identity. If the author didn't act out of malice but just wanted to avoid the topic, they might not be entirely wrong. However, the fact that they were called homophobic suggests that their approach might have been perceived as negative. They might not be in the wrong, but they could have handled it differently. However, others might argue that the author's discomfort is a form of being in the wrong because it's about not being accepting enough.\n\nBut according to the initial question, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). Based on the analysis, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they don't have a problem with being gay, just the frequency of the mentions. However, the way they addressed it might have been problematic. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author's intention was not to be homophobic, but the action might have been misinterpreted, the answer could be B (no wrong).\n"
