However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is wrong for not caring about gay pride and being uncomfortable with others bringing up their sexuality frequently.\n\nFirst, the person says they don't have an issue with gay people but are annoyed when others mention their sexuality often. They tried to hint and then directly express their discomfort, leading to being called homophobic. The key points here are the distinction between not supporting gay pride and being okay with gay people.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I know, being uncomfortable with someone discussing their identity is different from being discriminatory. The author isn't opposed to being around gay people but finds the constant mention of their sexuality annoying. They're not showing hatred or prejudice; they just want boundaries regarding how much someone else talks about their identity.\n\nHowever, when the author tried to express their discomfort, they were met with negative reactions. But the author clearly stated their acceptance of their sexuality, so the issue is more about personal boundaries than homophobia. The problem might be that the author's communication of their discomfort could be seen as invalidating the other's need to express their identity. But the author's stance is about personal space, not rejecting the person's identity.\n\nIn society, people have the right to express their identity, but others also have the right to set boundaries about how much they engage with others' identities. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful. They tried to hint and then explain their feelings directly. While the other people felt called out, the author didn't deny their sexuality or show hostility. So, it's more about differing social expectations and sensitivity.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a society where LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination, being overly sensitive to their expressions of identity could be seen as dismissive. But the author isn't opposing their identity; they just want less focus on it. This is a nuanced situation where both parties might have valid points of view.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they aren't discriminatory. Their discomfort is about personal preference, not homophobia. They communicated their feelings in a direct way, which might not have been well-received, but their intent wasn't malicious. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
