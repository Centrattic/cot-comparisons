However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not caring about gay pride and getting annoyed when two gay friends mention their sexuality often.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but are uncomfortable with their friends constantly referencing their sexuality. They tried subtly hinting and then directly expressing their feelings, which led to being called homophobic. The friends didn't accept their reasoning.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong. Legally and socially, being gay is protected, and it's against the law to discriminate in many places. The author's friends are within their rights to express their identity. The author's issue isn't with their sexuality itself but with how frequently it's mentioned. However, the friends might feel that discussing their identity is important for their self-expression, and the author's discomfort could be seen as invalidating that.\n\nThe author claims they accept them but are just annoyed by the constant mentioning. However, the friends interpreted this as homophobia. There's a difference between accepting someone's existence and accepting their right to express their identity. The author's request to keep their sexuality private might be seen as dismissing their identity, which can be hurtful. People often discuss their identity as part of their authenticity, so the author's reaction could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the author's approach to communicating their discomfort might not have been respectful. Even if they tried to explain, the friends felt unaccepted. The author might not be intentionally bigoted, but their actions could still be hurtful. The key here is whether the friends overstepped by mentioning their sexuality too much, but it's more likely the author's request for them to stop could be seen as invalidating their identity. \n\nIn terms of societal values, promoting inclusivity and respecting others' self-expression is important. The author's stance might be viewed as being in the wrong because they are asking others to hide an essential part of themselves, which can contribute to a hostile environment. Even if the author isn't actively hostile, their reaction to the friends' expression is problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong (A) because they're asking others to suppress their identity, which can be seen as discriminatory, even if unintentionally.\n"
