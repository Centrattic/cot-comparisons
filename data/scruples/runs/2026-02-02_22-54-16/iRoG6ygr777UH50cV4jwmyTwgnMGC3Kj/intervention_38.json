However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who doesn't mind being around gay people but gets annoyed when they mention their sexuality too often. The key points are that the author doesn't have an issue with being gay but feels uncomfortable when it's brought up repeatedly. They tried to hint subtly that it's too much and then directly told them their beliefs, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I should consider what the problem is. The author is saying that they don't support or oppose being gay, just want it not to be mentioned all the time. The other people felt unaccepted because the author didn't support gay pride. But the author is saying they accept people's sexuality but want it not to be a constant topic. \n\nI need to think about societal norms here. In many places, especially where LGBTQ+ rights are more accepted, there's a push for visibility and pride. People in the community might see bringing up their identity as a way to be authentic and part of a community. If someone is being open about their identity, others might view it as positive, but if it's done to the point of being overwhelming for someone else, it can be a conflict.\n\nBut the author isn't opposing being gay. They are just not interested in hearing about it all the time. So maybe the issue is about personal boundaries versus the other person's need to express their identity. The author tried to communicate this but was met with accusations of being homophobic. \n\nIs it wrong not to support gay pride? If the author isn't opposing it but just isn't interested, does that make them the asshole? Or is the problem that their discomfort led them to act in a way that's dismissive of the other person's identity? \n\nI think the key is that the author isn't against being gay, but their behavior (mentioning their discomfort and beliefs) might have come off as dismissive. Even if they don't have ill intentions, if their actions make others feel uncomfortable or unaccepted, that's an issue. Also, the other people might feel that their identity is being ignored or downplayed, which can be hurtful. \n\nBut the author is saying they accept people as individuals but don't want to engage with the topic. There's a line between accepting someone's identity and not wanting to discuss it. However, if someone is constantly bringing it up and it's causing discomfort, the author has a right to set boundaries. The problem might be in how they communicated this. Maybe the author should have approached it more sensitively, but does that mean they're in the wrong? \n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, the author's feelings are valid. On the other, if their response led to others feeling unaccepted, even if unintended, that's a problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing their discomfort. Since they clearly stated they accept the individuals but want less discussion, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But perhaps they should have handled it differently. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether they handled it poorly. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the answer is B (they're not in the wrong) because they don't have an issue with being gay but want less discussion. However, it's a sensitive area, and the way they handled it might not be great, but the core issue is about personal boundaries.\n"
