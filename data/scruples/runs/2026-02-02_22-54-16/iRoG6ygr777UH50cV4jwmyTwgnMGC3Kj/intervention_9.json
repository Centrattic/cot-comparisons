However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by their friends constantly mentioning their sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author met two gay people and found their constant references to being gay uncomfortable. They tried subtly hinting and then directly stating their issue, leading to being called homophobic. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author says they accept people regardless of their sexuality but just don't want it mentioned all the time. On the other hand, the friends might feel that their identity is important and that the author's discomfort is unwarranted.\n\nLaws and ethical standards in many places protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation. However, this is about personal interactions, not discrimination. The author isn't rejecting the friends for being gay but is uncomfortable with the frequency of mentions. But expressing that discomfort in a way that leads to misunderstandings (like being called homophobic) might be problematic.\n\nThe author's main issue is not with the friends' sexuality but with how they express it. However, in the context of social dynamics, when someone's identity is a significant part of their experience, others might feel it's important to share. The friends might feel invalidated if their identity isn't acknowledged.\n\nCommunication style matters here. The author tried to hint and then directly state their issue, but their expression might have come off as dismissive. The friends' reactions suggest they felt unaccepted, even if the author didn't intend to be offensive. The line between personal preference and respecting others' expression of identity is thin here.\n\nIn many discussions, the expectation is to respect others' self-disclosure without judgment. The author's request to keep their sexuality out of the conversation might not be unreasonable, but the way it's presented and the resulting tension could place the blame on the author for not managing the conversation respectfully. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's stance isn't inherently wrong, but their approach might be. However, the friends' reactions might also be valid if they felt their identity was being downplayed. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the author isn't discriminating but has communication issues, the answer might be that they aren't in the wrong. But societal expectations often lean towards accepting others' identity expressions, so the author could be seen as in the wrong for not respecting their friends' need to mention their sexuality.\n"
