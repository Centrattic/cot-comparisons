However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them.

After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not caring about Gay Pride and being annoyed by two gay friends who mention their sexuality a lot. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but just want them to keep it to themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they don't have a problem with homosexuality itself but are bothered by the constant mention of it. They tried subtly hinting and then directly expressing their feelings, which led to being called homophobic. The main question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting others to bring up their sexuality so much.\n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to their own identity and to express it. If the friends are openly gay and it's part of their identity, they might see it as natural to mention it. The author's discomfort could come from a place of misunderstanding or not wanting to engage with topics they find uncomfortable. But that doesn't necessarily make them homophobic. However, the author's approach might be dismissive of their friends' need to express their identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the friends might feel that their identity is being trivialized or ignored. If the author is telling them to \"keep it to themselves,\" it could be seen as invalidating their sexuality. Even if the author isn't opposed to being gay, not wanting to hear about it might come across as not fully accepting them for who they are. The friends' reaction of calling them homophobic might be because they feel their identity is being downplayed or marginalized by being asked to avoid discussing it.\n\nAlso, the author's statement \"We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it\" might be seen as separating their acceptance from active support. While they do accept, they don't support, which could be problematic. But it's a line between tolerance and acceptance. However, the friends might feel that true acceptance includes acknowledging their identity without making them feel they need to hide it.\n\nThe author's problem is that they're trying to distance themselves from the topic, which is a personal choice, but if it's causing discomfort to the friends, it's a conflict. The friends might feel that their identity is important and should be discussed. The author's approach of trying to avoid the topic could be seen as not respecting their friends' need to express themselves.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. They aren't opposing being gay, so they aren't homophobic. But by asking others not to mention their sexuality, they might be contributing to a sense that the friends' identity is a burden or something to be hidden. That could be considered problematic, even if the author's intention is just to avoid discomfort.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their request to not mention their sexuality could be seen as invalidating the friends' identity, even if they don't have a problem with being gay. Alternatively, some might argue it's B (not in the wrong) because they aren't opposing the friends' sexuality. But the key is that the friends felt the author was being homophobic, so the author's actions might be contributing to that perception, even if unintentionally. Therefore, leaning towards A, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
