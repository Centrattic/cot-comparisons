However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author met two gay people and found it annoying that they mentioned their sexuality frequently. The author says they don't have a problem with being gay but felt uncomfortable with the constant references. They tried to hint that it was too much and then openly stated their feelings, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider key points. The author claims they don't have an issue with gay people but just want them to keep their sexuality to themselves. The problem here is whether the author's reaction is justified. \n\nOn one hand, everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and preferences. If someone is uncomfortable with others bringing up their sexuality, that's their personal feeling. But on the other hand, the other people might feel that they are expressing their identity and shouldn't be expected to hide it. The author's friends might feel that the author is being judgmental or uncomfortable with their identity despite claiming no issue.\n\nThe author's approach: They tried to subtly hint, then went public. The friends reacted negatively. The author says they clearly stated acceptance but just wanted less mention. However, the friends felt called out. The author might be in a position where they are imposing their discomfort on others, which could be seen as unfair. Because while the author says they accept them, the constant correction about not being homophobic might not align with their actions of asking the friends to stop mentioning their identity.\n\nAlso, the friends might be highlighting that their identity is part of who they are, and they have the right to express it. The author's discomfort might be projecting their own issue onto the friends. So, even if the author doesn't have overt homophobia, their reaction to the friends' identity expression could be seen as problematic.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect others to respect their identity expressions. If someone's identity is being brought up in conversation, others might find it natural unless it's overdone. But the author is asking others to not mention it, which could be seen as dismissing their identity. The friends' reaction of calling the author homophobic might be a defense of their right to express their identity, even if the author's intent was different.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality but with how they express it. However, the friends might see this as the author being uncomfortable with their identity. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting the friends' right to express their identity, even if they prefer not to be reminded. The author's approach of stating their beliefs might have been the wrong way to handle it, leading to the conflict.\n"
