However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they met two gay people and started to get annoyed because they mentioned their sexuality too much. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but just find it annoying when they bring up being gay every few sentences. They tried to hint it's too much, then told them their beliefs, but got called homophobic.\n\nHmm. First, the author's stance is that they don't support or care about gay pride, but they don't have a problem with gay people. They just want them to keep their sexuality to themselves. The problem arises when the other people are vocal about their identity. \n\nNow, the key point here is about respecting someone's identity. If someone is openly gay and mentions their sexuality, they have the right to be their authentic selves. The author is not okay with that and finds it uncomfortable. But by not supporting gay pride and avoiding it, the author isn't being homophobic, but maybe not being supportive either. \n\nHowever, the main issue is the constant mention of being gay. The author is saying they don't mind being gay but mind the constant references. But perhaps the other people feel the need to mention their identity because of societal pressures or their own comfort. The author could be seen as not accepting the full expression of their identity, even if they don't have a problem with the identity itself. \n\nAlso, when the author tried to communicate this, they were met with accusations of being homophobic. The author says they clearly stated acceptance, so maybe the others misinterpreted their hints as prejudice. \n\nBut from a societal perspective, in many places, there's a push for openness about one's identity. So if the author is in an environment where being open about sexuality is normalized, the other people aren't doing anything wrong. The author's discomfort might stem from their own bias against the visibility of LGBTQ+ individuals, even if they don't have a direct prejudice against them. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if they are being asked to accept someone's identity and their right to express it, then the author is not in the wrong for not being supportive, but they might be in the wrong for not accepting the other person's need to express their identity. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and finding the mentions annoying. Since the author is not opposing being gay, just the visibility, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut in modern social norms, being part of the LGBTQ+ community often involves being open about one's identity. So if someone is constantly mentioning their sexuality, it's a part of their identity. The author is not wrong for not supporting gay pride, but they are wrong for being annoyed at someone's self-expression, especially if it's their authentic self. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they are not respecting the other person's right to express their identity, even if they don't support that expression through gay pride.\n"
