However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring about gay pride and becoming uncomfortable when two gay people they met kept mentioning their sexuality frequently.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but get annoyed when they're constantly reminded about it. They tried to subtly hint that the frequency was too much, then directly told them their beliefs, and were called homophobic. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no (author not wrong). \n\nHmm. Let's break down the ethics here. The author is uncomfortable with their friends being openly about their sexuality, to the point of mentioning it in every sentence. They don't have a problem with being gay but want it to be kept to themselves. The friends then react negatively, calling the author homophobic. The author clarifies they accept them as people but just don't want to hear it so often.\n\nIn terms of rights and respect, LGBTQ+ individuals have the right to express their identity. If someone is being open about their sexuality, even frequently, it's part of their identity. The author's discomfort is about the frequency, not the content. But does the author have the right to ask someone to refrain from discussing their own identity? That's a tricky point. \n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to express their identity without pressure to hide it. On the other hand, social dynamics involve boundaries. If someone's behavior makes others uncomfortable, is it their fault? But in this case, the friends are expressing their identity, which is generally protected. The author is reacting to the communication style, not the content. However, the friends might see it as the author being uncomfortable with their identity, hence calling them homophobic. \n\nBut the author explicitly states they accept the people as individuals. So maybe the friends misread the discomfort as homophobia. The author's issue is with the constant mention, not the fact of being gay. However, the friends felt rejected or misunderstood, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's possible that the author's approach was not the best. Directly stating their beliefs after subtle hints might come off as dismissive. But the root issue is the author's discomfort with the frequency of identity mentions, not the identity itself. \n\nThe question is whether this is the author's fault. From a rights perspective, the friends have every right to express their sexuality. The author's issue is a personal boundary that isn't being respected, but the friends aren't violating any social norms by expressing their identity. So, maybe the author is at fault for not respecting their friends' need to express their identity openly. Alternatively, the friends could have been more considerate of the author's sensitivity. \n\nBut in many cases, when someone is part of a marginalized group, their expression of identity is seen as necessary and valid. The author's discomfort might be a personal issue, but that doesn't mean they're wrong to feel that way. However, acting on that discomfort by asking someone to change their behavior could be seen as wrong, as it's their right to express themselves. \n\nSo, perhaps the author is not in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable, but they might be in the wrong for trying to impose their comfort level onto others' self-expression. However, the answer depends on the ethical framework\u2014individual rights vs. personal boundaries. If the friends are not being respectful of the author's boundaries by continuing to mention their sexuality despite the author's hints, then maybe they're at fault. But generally, people are allowed to express their identity freely, and others need to adjust their own comfort levels. \n\nIn this scenario, the author's actions (hinting and then stating their beliefs) could be seen as a reasonable attempt to set boundaries. However, the friends' reaction might be an overreach, but the author's approach might not be the main issue. \n\nI think the key here is whether expressing one's identity is a right that should be respected, regardless of others' comfort. Since it is, the author's discomfort doesn't justify the friends' behavior in being called homophobic. The author isn't wrong for having boundaries but might be wrong in not respecting the friends' right to express their identity. However, since the friends are not violating any norms, the author is in the wrong for trying to limit their self-expression. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (author is wrong) because they're not accepting the friends' right to express their identity, even if their intention is to avoid discomfort. Alternatively, if the friends overstepped by continuing despite the author's hints, but generally, the onus is on the author to accept others' expressions. \n\nAlternatively, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, but the friends misinterpreted it. However, the author's direct statement about their beliefs could be seen as invalidating the friends' need to express their identity. \n\nThis is a bit of a toss-up. But considering societal norms, the author's issue is with the expression of identity, not the identity itself. That might make the author the asshole because they're not accepting the friends' self-expression as valid, even if they don't have a problem with being gay. So, answer A.\n"
