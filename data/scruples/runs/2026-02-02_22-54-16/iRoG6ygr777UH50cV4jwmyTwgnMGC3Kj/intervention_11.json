However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring about gay pride and getting annoyed when two gay friends keep emphasizing their sexuality. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support them, and they found the constant mentioning of being gay uncomfortable. They tried to subtly hint at this but when that didn't work, they shared their beliefs and were called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author claims they're fine with the people's sexuality but don't support gay pride. They found the frequent mentions of it annoying. The friends reacted negatively, calling them homophobic despite the author stating they accept them. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, from a social justice perspective, being okay with someone's existence but not supporting their rights might be seen as not being fully accepting. The friends might feel that by not supporting gay pride, the author isn't standing with them against discrimination, even if they don't actively dislike them. However, the author's main issue is the frequency of mentioning their sexuality, not the sexuality itself. That could be a valid personal preference, but the way they addressed it might have come off as dismissive.\n\nThe author tried to hint subtly, which didn't work, then shared their beliefs more directly. The friends took offense. The problem here is that the author's approach might have been perceived as invalidating the friends' experiences. People often share their identities openly to feel accepted, and if the author's reaction was to downplay that, it could be seen as not supportive. Even if the author's intention was to reduce the mentions, the friends might feel their identity is being minimized.\n\nAlso, the author's statement about not supporting gay pride could imply a lack of advocacy, which some might equate with indifference or tacit acceptance of discrimination, even if that's not the case. The friends' reaction of calling them homophobic might stem from feeling that the author isn't on their side, even if the author doesn't have active hostility.\n\nHowever, the author isn't expressing hatred or wanting to harm. They just want the constant references to stop. But in doing so, they might be misunderstanding the friends' need to express their identity freely. It's a balance between personal comfort and respecting others' right to self-identify.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate. They didn't realize how the friends might perceive their comments. The friends might feel that by not supporting gay pride and asking them to downplay their identity, the author is contributing to a closeted environment where they can't be themselves. Even if the author's intention is neutral, the impact is negative.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has a right to their personal boundaries. If the author is uncomfortable with the frequency of mentions, that's their right. But the way they addressed it might have been the problem. Maybe they should have communicated their discomfort more carefully, without implying that the friends' identity is being overemphasized.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be a bad person, but their approach could be seen as insensitive. They might be in the wrong not because of their beliefs but because of how they communicated their discomfort and the implications of those beliefs regarding support for the LGBTQ+ community.\n"
