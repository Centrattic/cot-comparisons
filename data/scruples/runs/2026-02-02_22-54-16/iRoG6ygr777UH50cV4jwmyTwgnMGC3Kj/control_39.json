However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's acceptable to not care about gay pride and to ask others not to mention their sexuality so much.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author met two gay people and found their frequent mentions of being gay uncomfortable. They tried to hint and then directly tell them to stop, which led to being called homophobic, despite saying they accept them. The core issue seems to be the author's discomfort with others bringing up their sexuality and the reaction they got.\n\nNow, considering the principles of respect and acceptance. LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination, and being open about their identity can be a way to assert their authenticity. However, the author isn't opposed to being gay but is bothered by the frequency of mentioning it. The problem here is the author's approach. Even though their intention isn't to be discriminatory, their actions (asking the others to stop mentioning their sexuality) could be seen as invalidating the other person's need to express their identity.\n\nIn many cases, people in marginalized groups may feel the need to affirm their identity more, either because of past experiences or to find community. If someone is uncomfortable with that, even if they say they accept, it can come across as dismissive. The author might be in the wrong because they're imposing their comfort level on others, not considering that others have the right to express their identity as they see fit. Even if the author doesn't have a problem with being gay, creating an environment where others feel they must hide their identity is problematic. The term \"asshole\" here might be subjective, but from a societal standpoint, respecting others' self-expression is important. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
