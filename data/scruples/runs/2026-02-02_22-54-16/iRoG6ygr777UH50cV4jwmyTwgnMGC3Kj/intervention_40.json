However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who met two gay individuals and found their constant mention of being gay annoying. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't want to be involved in their gay pride. They tried to hint and then directly tell them to stop mentioning it so much, but got called homophobic. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's problem isn't with the people's sexuality but with how often they mention it. They claim to accept them but don't want the topic brought up. The friends felt the author was being homophobic. \n\nFrom a social perspective, people might feel that the author is being judgmental or not accepting, even if they don't have explicit prejudice. The issue here is whether it's acceptable to ask someone to not express part of their identity that's important to them. \n\nIn many cases, people take pride in their identity and expressing it is part of their self-expression. The author's discomfort with frequent mentions could be about their personal preference, but that doesn't mean the friends are wrong to express themselves. The friends might perceive the author's comments as invalidating their identity, even if the author isn't targeting them for being gay. \n\nAlso, when the author tried to address it directly, they were accused of being homophobic. This suggests a misunderstanding or mismatch in expectations. The author might not intend harm, but the friends felt disrespected. \n\nLegally and socially, it's protected to express one's sexuality, and the right to one's identity is important. The author's request might be about personal boundaries, but asking someone to hide part of their identity could be seen as imposing on their rights. \n\nSo, even if the author has good intentions, they might be in the wrong because they're asking the friends to suppress a key aspect of themselves. The friends' reaction is about feeling accepted and respected, which is crucial in relationships. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
