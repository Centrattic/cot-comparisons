However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people but started to dislike them because they kept emphasizing their sexuality in every conversation, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint that it was too much, then directly told them, and was called homophobic even though they said they accepted them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author doesn't have an issue with being gay but finds the constant mentions of their sexuality annoying. They tried to address it subtly and then directly. The people they met with reacted negatively, calling them homophobic despite the author's acceptance. \n\nNow, from a general perspective, LGBTQ+ individuals often share their identity as part of their self-expression. It's important to respect that. However, the author's discomfort isn't about being gay but about the frequency of mentions. The author is saying they just want to interact without the constant references. \n\nBut here's the catch: if the author is comfortable with the people themselves, just not the frequency of their mentioning their sexuality, does that make the author wrong? Some might argue that the individuals have the right to express their identity freely, and the author's request to stop might be seen as wanting to suppress their identity. Others might see it as the author's right to set boundaries in social interactions.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If the author is not discriminating against them based on their sexuality but is instead asking them to not mention it so much, perhaps it's a matter of personal boundaries versus the other person's self-expression. But if the author is being asked to accept their identity while also being uncomfortable with it being mentioned, maybe the author's issue isn't with their sexuality but with their personality or how they express it. The author isn't opposing their sexuality but is bothered by the repetition. \n\nBut in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the author's actions were offensive or discriminatory. The author clearly states they accept the people for their sexuality, so the problem isn't with their identity but with the frequency of mentions. However, in social interactions, people often discuss aspects of their identity, especially if it's a significant part of who they are. The author's request might be reasonable in terms of personal comfort, but if it's framed in a way that's perceived as not accepting their identity, that could lead to conflict.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were respectful. They tried subtly first, then directly. The other party reacted negatively, calling them homophobic. The author's argument is that they accept them but just don't want the constant mentions. However, from the other perspective, if someone's identity is being minimized or asked to be hidden, that's a problem. So, the author's request might be seen as invalidating the other person's need to express their identity, even if it's not the author's intent.\n\nIn terms of societal values, it's important to respect others' identities and not pressure them to hide parts of themselves. So, if the author is asking someone to downplay their identity, even if it's just the frequency, that might be seen as problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're not respecting the other person's right to express their identity, even if it's uncomfortable for the author.\n\nBut then again, the author is not opposing their identity, just the frequency. It's a gray area. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries. But if the expression of identity is being restricted in a social setting, that's a different matter. It's a balance between personal comfort and respect for others' self-expression. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were respectful. If they communicated this in a respectful way, it's more about personal boundaries. But if they're dismissing an essential part of the other person's identity, that's different. The author says they tried to subtly hint and then directly told them, which is a reasonable approach. The problem arises if the other person feels their identity is being marginalized. However, the author's issue isn't with the identity itself but the frequency of mentions. \n\nGiven that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, in many cases, people might argue that the individuals have the right to discuss their identity as they see fit, and the author's discomfort is their own issue to manage. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But others might see it as A (Yes), because they're asking the other person to hide part of their identity. It's a tough call, but I think the fact that the author accepts the people's sexuality and the issue is just about frequency might mean they aren't in the wrong.\n"
