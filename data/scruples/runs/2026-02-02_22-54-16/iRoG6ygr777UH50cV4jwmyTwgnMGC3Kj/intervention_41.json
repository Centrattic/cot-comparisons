However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone not caring about gay pride and getting called out for being homophobic, even though they claim to accept people's sexuality. The main issue seems to be that the author got uncomfortable when the two gay people they met kept mentioning their sexuality a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they don't have a problem with gay people but found it annoying when the others made it obvious. They tried to hint and then directly told them, but got called homophobic. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA), with options A or B.\n\nSo, key points here: the author isn't opposed to being gay, but they are bothered by the frequency of mentioning it. The other people might feel the need to assert their identity, which could be due to personal experience or societal pressures. The author then expressed their discomfort and was labeled as homophobic despite saying they accept them. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's issue is with how the others express their identity, not the identity itself. But in terms of social norms, it's generally considered acceptable for people to express their identity as they wish, including frequently. The author's request for them to stop might be seen as invalidating, even if their intent is not to discriminate. However, the author isn't discriminating against them for being gay; they just find the constant references annoying. \n\nBut when the author told them about their beliefs, they were called homophobic. That's problematic because just because someone's identity is expressed a certain way, it doesn't mean that expressing discomfort with the expression is automatically homophobia. However, the way the author approached it might have been insensitive. The others might have felt attacked, even if the author's intent wasn't to be discriminatory.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't wrong for having a boundary about how others express their identity, but they might have handled it poorly. However, the core of the problem is the author's desire for others to not mention their sexuality so much. In a society that values open expression of identity, the author's request might not be considered reasonable. Therefore, the author might be seen as in the wrong for not accepting the other people's choice to express their identity openly. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B, but I have to think carefully.\n\nAnother angle: the author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality per se, but with how they express it. That's a key distinction. However, people have the right to express their identity as they choose, and others can't force them to be less open. So the author's problem is with the expression, not the identity. But if the author is being asked to accept the expression, then maybe they are in the wrong for not respecting the other's right to express. However, the author is also within their rights to not like certain behaviors, as long as they aren't discriminatory. \n\nThe line here is between personal preference and discrimination. If the author isn't discriminating but just finds the behavior annoying, they're not necessarily in the wrong. However, the reaction of the other people (calling them homophobic) might be a misunderstanding. But the author's own actions might have been misinterpreted. The key is whether the author's request is reasonable. \n\nIn some cases, people might feel that others should be able to express their identity freely without being asked to tone it down. So the author's request could be seen as invalidating. However, the author is not opposing the identity, just the frequency of mention. \n\nIn summary, the answer might depend on whether the author's objection is seen as a personal preference or as discriminatory. If it's the former, then B (not in the wrong). If the latter, then A. But given the author's statement that they accept them, it's more about personal preference. So the answer is B.\n"
