However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who kept bringing up their sexuality in every conversation, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to subtly hint that they were mentioning it too much, then stated their beliefs and was accused of being homophobic. The author claims they don't have a problem with gay people but just don't want it brought up constantly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author isn't opposed to being gay; they just find the constant emphasis on it annoying. However, the other people are openly expressing their identity, which is their right. The author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality but with how frequently it's being mentioned. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From a social perspective, everyone has the right to express their identity, and others shouldn't feel pressured to downplay their personal experiences. However, the author is also expressing a desire to not be around that constant discussion. The problem arises when the author resorted to stating their beliefs, which led to conflict. \n\nThe people the author met might feel that the author's comments were dismissive or judgmental, even if the author intended to accept them. The key here is the author's approach. Instead of addressing the frequency of the mentions directly, the author brought up their beliefs, which could be seen as a judgment. Even if the author didn't mean to be, the act of stating beliefs about a sensitive topic can come across as insensitive, especially after the initial subtle hints didn't work. \n\nAlso, the author's initial reaction was to try to hint, which shows some awareness of the sensitivity of the issue. But then escalating to sharing their beliefs might not be the right approach. The people might feel that their identity is being criticized, hence the backlash. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable, but the way they handled the situation could be problematic. However, the other people have every right to express their sexuality in their interactions. The author's desire to avoid the topic is valid, but how they communicated that might have been inappropriate. \n\nThe main issue here is the conflict between personal boundaries and respect for others' identities. The author's discomfort is subjective, but the other people's expression of their identity is a fundamental right. If the author's actions crossed a line into judgment or disrespect, then they might be at fault. But if they were only trying to set boundaries without being disrespectful, maybe not. \n\nBut in this case, the author did mention stating their beliefs, which led to being called homophobic. Even if they said they accept them, the act of bringing up their beliefs about the topic in a conversation where the other people are trying to express their identity could be seen as invalidating. So, the author's approach might be what's causing the conflict, making them at fault. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because their method of addressing the discomfort was inappropriate and could be perceived as judgmental, even if their intention wasn't to be.\n"
