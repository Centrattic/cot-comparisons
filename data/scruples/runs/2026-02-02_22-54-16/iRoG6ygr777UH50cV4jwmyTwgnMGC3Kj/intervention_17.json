However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The author claims that two people they met are very vocal about their homosexuality, mentioning it in every sentence, which makes the author uncomfortable. The author tried subtly hinting they didn't want to hear it so much, then directly stated their views, which led to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main issue isn't with the people's sexuality but with how frequently they mention it. The author says they don't have a problem with gay people, just that they find it annoying when their sexuality is brought up constantly. They tried to communicate this both subtly and then directly, but were met with accusations of homophobia.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about societal norms and personal boundaries. It's generally accepted that people should be accepted for who they are, including their sexual orientation. However, in this case, the author isn't opposing the other people's identities but rather the frequency of their mentions. The problem arises when the author's discomfort leads them to express this to the point of being labeled as homophobic.\n\nOne angle is that the author is within their rights to set personal boundaries. If someone is making excessive mention of their identity, others can reasonably request that they do so less frequently. However, the author's approach might have been problematic. They stated their beliefs, which could have come off as judgmental, even if they meant to clarify acceptance. The other individuals might have felt that the author's stance on their beliefs (religious or otherwise) was an issue, not just the frequency of mentions.\n\nAnother point is the concept of \"safe spaces\" and respect. While the author wants the other people to not mention their sexuality so much, the people in question might feel they have the right to express their identity openly. There's a balance between respecting someone's identity and personal discomfort.\n\nThe author's statement that they don't support being gay but just want to be left alone is a bit confusing. They say they accept people, but then mention they wouldn't support them. This could be where the misunderstanding comes from. The line between personal beliefs and acceptance is thin here. If the author's beliefs are such that they don't support the LGBTQ+ community, even if they personally accept individuals, that might be where the issue lies. However, the author clarifies that they're not against the people but just against the constant mention. Still, the way they phrased their beliefs might have been misinterpreted.\n\nIn terms of the response from the other people, calling them homophobic might be an overreaction if the author was only expressing discomfort with frequency, not the identity itself. However, if the author's beliefs conflict with LGBTQ+ rights, that's different. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful. If they tried to communicate their discomfort without attacking the people's identity, they might not be in the wrong. But if their communication was dismissive or judgmental, that's where the problem is.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their discomfort, but their approach might have been flawed. However, the core issue is that the author isn't opposing the other people's sexuality, just the frequency of mentions. Unless the author's comments were harmful or discriminatory, they might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer could be B (No), but with the caveat that the author should communicate more effectively to avoid misunderstandings.\n"
