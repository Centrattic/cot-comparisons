However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and started to dislike them because they kept mentioning their sexuality a lot. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but finds it annoying when they bring up their sexuality so frequently. They tried subtly hinting and then explaining their views, but were called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about acceptance and the boundaries of personal space. The author claims they don't have a problem with being gay but are uncomfortable with the frequency of mentions. However, there's a contradiction here. If the author isn't against homosexuality but just wants others not to mention it so much, is that a legitimate stance?\n\nFrom a social perspective, people often share aspects of their identity, especially if it's a significant part of who they are. If someone is open about their sexuality, it's part of their personal expression. The author might be imposing their discomfort on others, expecting the other people to adjust their behavior. The fact that the author was called homophobic suggests that their comments were perceived as invalidating or discriminatory, even if they didn't intend that.\n\nThe author's approach of telling the others their beliefs might have come across as dismissive or judgmental, regardless of the actual intent. The right to express one's identity is important, and others have the right to be themselves without being told to suppress it. The author's problem isn't with the people's sexuality but with how they express it, which could still be considered a form of prejudice if it's based on discomfort with differences.\n\nHowever, the author does state they accept the people for who they are, just not the frequency of mentions. But if the mention is part of the person's identity and they're doing it naturally, the author's discomfort might be more about their own biases or social expectations. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because they're asking others to hide an essential part of themselves, even if it's not out of malice. The line between personal space and respecting others' identities is a delicate one here.\n\nOn the other hand, if the people were indeed being overbearing or making the author uncomfortable in a way that's affecting their interaction, there's a balance to consider. But in most cases, the expectation is to respect others' identities and expressions unless it's causing direct harm. The author's actions, especially after being called homophobic, might indicate a lack of understanding of how their words are perceived, even if they don't hold the same prejudices.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're asking others to conceal their identity in a way that's not acceptable, and their communication approach was ineffective and possibly hurtful. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
