However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not caring about Gay Pride and getting annoyed when two gay people kept mentioning their sexuality. They tried to subtly hint and then directly told them it was too frequent, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't have an issue with gay people and accept them. So their intention isn't to be discriminatory. But the problem here is about how they expressed their discomfort. The key point is that the gay individuals were being explicit about their identity, which the author found annoying. \n\nNow, I need to consider societal norms and expectations regarding discussing one's identity. People in the LGBTQ+ community often feel the need to assert their identity in spaces where it might not be safe or acknowledged. If these two people were in a situation where they felt the need to mention their sexuality frequently, maybe the author's environment isn't as accepting as they think. However, the author's experience was personal interactions, not a public space.\n\nBut the author's response was to hint and then state their beliefs, which led to conflict. Even if they said they accept, the act of pointing out the frequency of the mentions can come off as dismissive or invalidating. The phrase \"just keep me out of it\" might imply that the author is uncomfortable with the topic, which could be seen as a problem because it's the other person's identity, not just an external issue. \n\nAlso, the author didn't like the constant references, but in forming relationships, mutual respect is important. If the other people felt the need to share their identity, it's part of who they are. The author's frustration might stem from not understanding the context of why they're mentioning it so much. Maybe the author's environment isn't as inclusive, and the gay individuals are trying to establish trust or visibility.\n\nHowever, the author did say they accept them, so their stance isn't inherently wrong. The issue is the reaction to the frequency. The problem is that the author is asking the other person to change their behavior based on the author's discomfort. That's a bit of a self-centered approach. People should be allowed to express their identity without being told to tone it down unless it's causing harm. \n\nBut the question is about the author's right to express their discomfort. If the author is in a place where they can set boundaries, maybe they're not wrong to feel that way. However, in many social contexts, especially with marginalized groups, there's an expectation of support and inclusion. The author's \"I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it every few minutes\" might be seen as invalidating the other person's need to be open about their identity.\n\nThe response of being called homophobic is a result of the author's direct statement. Even if the author's intent was to ask for less frequent mentions, the way they communicated it might not have been respectful. The phrase \"just keep me out of it\" can be misinterpreted as wanting to ignore or erase the other person's identity, which is a common concern in LGBTQ+ communities. \n\nSo, even if the author isn't intentionally homophobic, their actions and words in the situation could be perceived as dismissive. The wrong here is more about how they expressed their discomfort rather than their personal feelings. The key is whether the author's request to stop mentioning their sexuality is reasonable. Since the other person is sharing their identity, the author's demand for silence could be seen as a problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
