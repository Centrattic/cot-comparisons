However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed when their gay friends mention their sexuality too often.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author says they met two gay people but started disliking them because they felt the friends were being too vocal about their sexuality. The author tried to subtly hint they mention it too much, then expressed their beliefs, leading to being called homophobic even though they clarified they accept their friends. The main issue here is the author's discomfort with frequent mentions of being gay and whether that's justified or not.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author has no problem with being gay but finds the constant reminders uncomfortable. The friends might be using their identity as a way to bond or feel accepted, but the author is turned off by the frequency. The author's response was to hint and then be more direct, resulting in conflict.\n\nI should consider social norms and perspectives. Many people in the LGBTQ+ community use their identity as a significant part of who they are. Sharing experiences related to being gay can be a way to connect, especially in spaces where they might feel marginalized. The author's discomfort might be seen as not respecting their friends' need to express their identity, even if the author is not opposed to it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't against gay people and just wants to avoid the topic. But in that case, maybe the friends felt the author's hints were not being heeded, leading to frustration. The friends might perceive the author's desire to avoid the topic as a form of discomfort or prejudice, even if it's not intentional. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the friends were being overbearing and the author had no issue with their sexuality, perhaps the author isn't at fault for setting boundaries. However, if the friends were open about their identity in a way that's natural, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that aspect of their communication style. \n\nI need to think about the concept of \"keeping me out of it.\" The author says they don't want to support gay pride but just want it not to be mentioned. That could come off as not wanting to engage with their identity, which is important. Even if the author is accepting, the constant reminders might be necessary for the friends to feel authentic. \n\nAlso, the friends' reaction to being called homophobic\u2014maybe they felt the author's comments were closeted homophobia or microaggressions. The line between legitimate discomfort and prejudice is thin here. The author's stance might be seen as not supporting their friends' identity, which can be hurtful even if unintentional. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because respecting someone's identity and their need to express it is a fundamental part of acceptance. The author's request to avoid the topic could be seen as invalidating the friends' experience, even if their intent was neutral. The friends might feel that their identity is central to them, and the author's discomfort with that could lead to rejection, even if the author isn't overtly prejudiced.\n"
