I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not liking that two gay friends keep mentioning their sexuality frequently, leading to discomfort and conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author doesn't have a problem with being gay but finds it annoying when their friends constantly reference their sexuality. They tried subtly hinting and then more directly expressing their feelings, leading to being called homophobic. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nSo, what's the issue here? The author is not opposing being gay but is uncomfortable with the constant mentions. The friends are open about their sexuality, which the author finds intrusive. The author's stance is \"I don't care, just don't mention it,\" while the friends might feel their identity is important to share.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it's about personal boundaries and respect. The author has the right to feel uncomfortable about certain topics being brought up, but the friends might see their identity as an integral part of who they are. However, if the author is not actually opposing the friends' sexuality but is just bothered by the frequency, the problem might be more about personal discomfort than discrimination.\n\nBut wait, the friends might feel that their identity is being dismissed when the author wants them to stop mentioning it. Even if the author says they accept them, the friends might interpret the constant comments as the author not being fully accepting. Also, the author's actions of bringing up their beliefs might have been perceived as judgmental, even if the intent was just to express discomfort.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friends might feel that they have the right to express their identity openly, and the author's request to stop could be seen as invalidating their experiences. In such cases, the onus might be on the author to either accept the friends' need to discuss their identity or adjust the relationship boundaries.\n\nHowever, if the author is not making the friends feel unwelcome but just wants them to not focus on their sexuality so much, it's a matter of personal preference. But the friends' reactions suggest that they feel their identity is central to them, and the author's discomfort might lead to them feeling marginalized.\n\nIn terms of social justice, promoting acceptance means respecting others' identities even if it's uncomfortable. But also, people can set boundaries about what they're comfortable discussing. The conflict here is between the friends' right to self-expression and the author's comfort with their own boundaries.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is discriminatory. Since they state they don't have an issue with being gay, it's not homophobia. However, the author's discomfort might be seen as expecting others to conform to their preferences, which can be a form of subtle bias. The friends might feel that their identity is being minimized to fit the author's comfort, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are dismissive of the friends' identity. If the author is not opposing the friends' sexuality but is just uncomfortable with the frequency of mentions, they might not be in the wrong. But if the friends feel their identity is being invalidated, the author might be seen as imposing their preferences.\n\nIn many cases, people might side with the friends because their identity is important, and the author's discomfort shouldn't require others to adjust. However, the author is allowed to set boundaries. The line is thin here. The friends might be overdoing it, but the author's approach might have been abrupt or not considerate enough of the friends' perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if their discomfort leads to invalidating the friends' need to express their identity. But if the friends are indeed bringing it up excessively and the author is just expressing a legitimate discomfort without malice, it's a gray area. However, given the friends' reactions, the author's approach might have been insufficiently sensitive, leading to the conflict.\n"
