However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring about gay pride and getting upset when two gay friends keep mentioning their sexuality frequently.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author says they don't have a problem with gay people but are annoyed by the constant references to their sexuality. They tried to subtly hint that it's too much and then stated their beliefs, which led to being called homophobic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's stance on acceptance versus the friends' behavior. The author claims acceptance but is bothered by the frequency of mentions. The friends felt unaccepted because they were labeled as homophobic for not supporting gay pride. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and what's generally accepted as respectful behavior. People have the right to be open about their identity, and others should respect that unless it's causing direct harm. The author's issue isn't with the friends' sexuality per se but with how often they mention it. The friends might see it as a natural part of their identity and expression, and the author's discomfort could be seen as expecting them to downplay their identity for the author's comfort. \n\nAlso, the author tried to address it subtly first, which is reasonable, but when they stated their beliefs, it led to conflict. The friends' reaction suggests they felt their identity was being dismissed. The author might not be intentionally homophobic, but their reaction is causing discomfort for the friends. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's desire to avoid discussing it might not be the issue, but the way they reacted when they asked the friends to stop might have been inappropriate. However, the friends could also be overstepping if they're making everyone mention their sexuality. But generally, people can't be forced to hide their identity. The author's stance of \"just keep me out of it\" might be acceptable, but pushing back against the friends' expression could be seen as the problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in a tricky spot. They don't have to support gay pride events, but they shouldn't make others feel they need to hide their identity. However, if the friends are being pushy, maybe there's some nuance. But the main issue is that the author's discomfort led to them being labeled as homophobic despite their acceptance. The answer might hinge on whether the author's request was reasonable. Since the friends are asserting their identity, the author's insistence on them not mentioning it could be the problem. So, the author is in the wrong because they're trying to limit others' self-expression even if they claim acceptance. Therefore, answer A.\n"
