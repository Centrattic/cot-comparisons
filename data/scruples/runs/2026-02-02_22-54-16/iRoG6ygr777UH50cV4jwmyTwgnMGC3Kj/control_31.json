However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person is uncomfortable with their friends constantly mentioning their sexuality. They don't have an issue with being gay but find the frequent references annoying. They tried hinting that it's too much, then directly told them their beliefs, and were met with accusations of being homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author accepts the people's sexuality but is bothered by how often they mention being gay. The friends felt offended and called the author homophobic, even though the author says they accept them. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From a social perspective, respecting people's identities is important. However, the friends might see discussing their sexuality as part of their identity and feel that the author's discomfort is a form of judgment. The author's stance is \"don't mention it,\" but the friends might feel their identity is being dismissed. \n\nAlso, the author tried to communicate this but got a negative reaction. The friends might feel that the author is not accepting unless they actively support LGBTQ+ issues, which the author isn't doing. The author is not opposing LGBTQ+ rights but is neutral. However, being neutral in a space where others are vocal can be seen as not supporting them, which might lead to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the friends bringing up their sexuality isn't inherently harmful if they feel it's part of who they are. The author's issue isn't with the sexuality itself but with the frequency. But the friends might feel their identity is being trivialized if the author is uncomfortable with it being mentioned. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't doing anything wrong by not being actively supportive. But socially, expecting people to not discuss their identity can be seen as problematic. The friends might feel the author is not fully accepting them unless they ignore their identity. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong in terms of having their own preferences, but their approach may not be considerate of the friends' needs to express their identity. However, the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride. The author isn't opposing it, just not supporting it. But the friends might feel that the author's discomfort over their identity mentions is a form of rejection. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for having their own boundaries, but the conflict arises from differing expectations. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if the author's actions cross into being disrespectful. The author did communicate their discomfort, which is reasonable, but the friends' reaction also matters. Since the author didn't express hate, just discomfort, it's more a matter of differing social expectations. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
