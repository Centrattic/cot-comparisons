However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, they met two gay people and started to dislike them because they mentioned their sexuality too much. The author says they don't have an issue with being gay but just want them to keep it to themselves. They tried to hint that it's too much and then directly told them their beliefs, which led to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the key issues are here. The main point is about the frequency of mentioning one's sexuality. The author argues that they're not against being gay but find it annoying when it's brought up constantly. However, from a broader perspective, people often share aspects of their identity, especially if it's a significant part of their life. So, maybe the author is being dismissive of the importance of that identity to the other people.\n\nBut wait, the author says they accept them for their sexuality. The problem is the frequency of mention. So, is it the author's right to ask others not to share personal information? Or is it the other people's right to express their identity as they see fit?\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author is projecting their discomfort. They might not realize that for some people, being open about their sexuality is a positive and necessary part of their self-expression. Constant mentions might be their way of being authentic, and the author's request to stop could be seen as invalidating that authenticity.\n\nAlso, when the author stated their beliefs, they were accused of homophobia. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, their actions (asking others to hide their identity) could be perceived as such. The line between personal boundaries and respecting others' expressions is thin here.\n\nBut the author claims they have no issue with being gay, just the constant mention. However, in social interactions, people often share parts of their identity naturally. If the author is uncomfortable with that, maybe they need to adjust their expectations. It's possible the author's discomfort stems from misunderstanding the importance of that identity for others.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, their actions could be seen as inconsiderate. They are asking others to suppress a core part of their identity, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a cultural or societal context I'm missing. In many places, being open about one's sexuality is encouraged, and others are expected to respect that without demanding it to be hidden. So the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
