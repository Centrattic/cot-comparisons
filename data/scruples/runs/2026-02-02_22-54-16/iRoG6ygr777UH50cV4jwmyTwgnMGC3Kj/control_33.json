However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and found their constant mention of being gay annoying. The author tried to hint they shouldn't mention it so much, but when that didn't work, they shared their beliefs and were called homophobic. Now the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people and just want their sexuality not to be brought up so often. The gay individuals, on the other hand, might feel that their identity is important to them and that they're being judged or disrespected. \n\nThe key points here are about respect for personal identity and boundaries. The author is expressing discomfort with how frequently their friends mention their sexuality. However, it's also possible that the friends feel the need to assert their identity, possibly as a way of dealing with a society that sometimes stigmatizes them. \n\nThe author tried to address the issue by hinting and then stating their beliefs. The friends took offense, leading to a conflict. The question is whether the author's actions were inappropriate. \n\nI think the author's mistake is not realizing that their request not to mention their sexuality could be seen as wanting to invalidate or downplay an important part of the friends' identities. Even if the author is not homophobic, the friends might feel that the author is uncomfortable with their openness, which can lead to feeling unwelcome. \n\nAdditionally, the author's approach might not have considered the friends' reasons for being open about their sexuality. It's possible that the friends are proud of who they are and feel the need to express that. The author's desire for their identity to be irrelevant in their interactions might conflict with the friends' need to be authentic.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they are prioritizing their discomfort over the friends' need to express a core part of themselves. Even if the friends mention it frequently, the author's response was not respectful of their identity. It's about finding a balance between personal boundaries and respecting others' self-expression. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions, while possibly stemming from a place of non-judgment, could be seen as dismissive of the friends' identity. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
