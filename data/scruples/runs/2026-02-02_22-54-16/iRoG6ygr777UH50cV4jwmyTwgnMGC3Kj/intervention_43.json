However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by their friends mentioning their sexuality too much.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't have an issue with gay people but are uncomfortable with the constant mention of being gay. They tried hinting but then told their friends their beliefs and got called homophobic. The question is whether they're wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here: the author's discomfort isn't about the sexuality itself but the frequency of the mentions. They claim to accept the friends but are bothered by the constant references. \n\nI need to consider societal norms. In many cases, people in the LGBTQ+ community might bring up their identity more often to affirm their identity or because they feel it's important. However, if the author finds it annoying, that could be a sensitivity. But the problem is whether the author's reaction is valid.\n\nBut wait, the friends might feel that bringing up their identity is part of being authentic. The author's response could be seen as invalidating their need to express that part of themselves. However, the author isn't opposing their sexuality; they just don't want it mentioned all the time. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? Or is it the friends' right to express their identity? The author tried to hint and then explain their feelings. But being called homophobic suggests that the friends felt their identity was being dismissed. Even if the author accepts them, the friends might feel that the author's discomfort leads to not accepting their need to express their identity openly. \n\nAlso, the line \"I just want to keep me out of it\" might imply that the author doesn't want to engage with the friends' identity, which could be seen as not fully accepting them as they are. Socially, acceptance often involves being comfortable with someone's identity, not just tolerating it. \n\nSo, the author's issue isn't with the friends themselves but with how they express their identity. The friends might feel that the author's request to stop mentioning it is a form of rejection. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're not fully accepting the friends' need to be open about their sexuality, even if they don't have a problem with the sexuality itself. \n\nAlternatively, if the friends were making it a topic of every conversation, maybe that's excessive, but it's hard to judge without more context. However, the author's approach of stating their beliefs led to conflict, which might mean they crossed a line by not respecting the friends' boundaries in expressing their identity. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their discomfort leads them to invalidate the friends' need to express their identity, which can be seen as not fully accepting them, even if they say they accept their sexuality.\n"
