However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's unpack this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that they met two gay people who kept emphasizing their sexuality, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint about it and then openly expressed their feelings, leading to being called homophobic. They claim they don't have an issue with being gay but want others to stop bringing it up so much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states they don't have a problem with gay people but finds the constant mention of their sexuality annoying. They tried to communicate this subtly first, then more directly. However, the other people took offense, calling them homophobic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, it's important to recognize that marginalized groups often discuss their identities as part of their lived experience. For gay individuals, coming out and being open about their sexuality is an act of self-acceptance and authenticity. If others find this disruptive, it can be seen as imposing their discomfort on someone else's right to express their identity. \n\nThe author's discomfort stems from the frequency of the mentions, not the sexuality itself. However, the act of repeatedly bringing up one's identity in a conversation isn't inherently wrong. The author's approach\u2014both subtle hints and then stating their beliefs\u2014might have been misinterpreted or not effectively communicated. The friends might have felt attacked or invalidated, even if the author's intent was just to ask for less mention. \n\nBut the author did make it clear they accept the others' sexuality; the issue was the frequency. The problem here could be the author's frustration with something that's part of the other's identity. It's a sensitive area because while everyone has the right to their comfort level, others also have the right to be themselves. The line is blurry. The author isn't being openly hostile, but their reaction could be seen as dismissing the other's need to express their identity. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, it's generally expected to respect others' identities even if it's uncomfortable. The author's desire to avoid the topic doesn't outweigh the other's right to discuss it. Also, the friends' immediate reaction of calling them homophobic might be harsh, but their feelings are valid if they felt the author was trying to suppress their identity. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they're expressing discomfort with something that's a fundamental part of the other person's identity. While they don't have to be overly supportive, actively asking the others to stop discussing their sexuality could be seen as invalidating. The answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because respecting someone's identity includes allowing them to express it without pressure to hide or downplay it.\n"
