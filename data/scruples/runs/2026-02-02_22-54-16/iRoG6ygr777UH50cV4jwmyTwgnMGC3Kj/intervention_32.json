However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being uncomfortable with two gay friends who mention their sexuality a lot. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author says they have no issue with gay people and accept them. But they found their gay friends constantly bringing up their identity, which made them uncomfortable. The friends reacted negatively, calling them homophobic. The author is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about acceptance and the friends' reactions. The author's discomfort might be valid, but the way they handled it is important. They first tried to subtly hint, which didn't work, then told the friends their beliefs. But if the friends felt offended, even if the author said they accept them, maybe the author didn't communicate that clearly enough. \n\nAlso, considering the context, when someone is part of a marginalized group, they might feel the need to express their identity more to cope with societal pressures. The author's friends might have felt that their identity was being invalidated by the author's discomfort with frequent mentions. The author could be seen as not respecting their friends' need to be open about their sexuality, even if that's not their intention. \n\nBut the author isn't against being gay, just not wanting to hear about it all the time. However, the friends might have felt that the author's hints and eventual direct statement were dismissive or judgmental. Even if the author's intention was to be accepted, the friends might have interpreted it as not being supportive enough, especially since the author didn't support gay pride. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, in terms of the friends' feelings, the author's actions could have been hurtful. Just because they don't support gay pride doesn't mean they can't accept their friends. The friends might have felt that by being unenthusiastic about their identity, the author is not fully accepting them. Also, if the author is uncomfortable with the mentions, maybe they should have addressed it in a more respectful way, like having a direct conversation without judgment. But the friends' reaction was quick to label them as homophobic, which might be a bit harsh if the author explicitly stated acceptance. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they might not have considered how their words and actions could affect their friends' sense of being accepted. Even if it's about personal boundaries, constantly bringing up the issue and then expressing it directly might have crossed a line. The friends might need that expression as part of their identity and feel like the author is not supportive, hence the resentment. The author's approach could be seen as invalidating, even if that's not their intention. So, the answer is A.\n"
