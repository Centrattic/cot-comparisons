However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who met two gay people but started disliking them because they were \"making it painfully obvious\" they were gay. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support gay pride and just want to keep their distance. They tried to hint that the others were mentioning their sexuality too much but got called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author claims they don't have a problem with being gay but are annoyed by the constant references. The main question is whether not wanting someone to mention their sexuality is okay. \n\nIn terms of social norms, many people argue that individuals should have the right to express their identity openly. So, if someone is being their authentic self, others shouldn't feel it's intrusive. The author's discomfort might stem from personal preference, but that doesn't mean the other people are wrong for expressing themselves. However, the author isn't opposing their sexuality, just the frequency of mentions.\n\nBut then, how much should someone have to avoid mentioning their identity? If the author is uncomfortable, maybe they should adjust their own expectations. The problem arises when the author's dislike leads to exclusion or resentment. However, the author isn't acting out of hatred but personal discomfort. \n\nThe other people called them homophobic, which might be a misunderstanding. The author clarifies they accept the individuals, just not the constant mentions. That's a nuance that might not be fully understood. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they aren't opposing gay rights or being abusive. They're expressing a personal boundary. But respecting others' need to express their identity is also important. The author's action in telling them about their beliefs might not be wrong, but expecting others to change their behavior because of personal discomfort could be problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't malicious, but their stance might not consider the other people's right to express their identity openly. However, the line between personal boundaries and discrimination can be blurry. The answer might depend on whether intent and impact are both considered. The impact here is that the author is uncomfortable and wants others to change, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But the intent isn't hatred. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but their approach could be better handled.\n"
