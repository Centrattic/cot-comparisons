However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is wrong. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author says they met two gay people and initially liked them, but then started to dislike them because they kept mentioning their sexuality too much. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support gay pride. They told the people they found the constant references annoying, and when they tried to explain their feelings, they were called homophobic. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The author's main complaint is that the two people made their sexuality too obvious, which made the author uncomfortable. They tried to hint at it first, then directly told them their beliefs, but were met with resentment. The author claims they accept the people's sexuality but just want them to stop mentioning it so much.\n\nNow, from a social and ethical standpoint, it's important to respect people's identities. If someone is openly discussing their sexuality, especially if they feel the need to mention it frequently, it's part of their self-expression. The author might be imposing their discomfort on others, which isn't fair. However, the author isn't opposing the people's sexuality but is bothered by the frequency of the mentions. \n\nBut wait, does the author have a right to ask others to not bring up their sexuality if it's making them uncomfortable? Or is it about respecting the other person's right to express their identity? Also, the author says they don't support gay pride, which might indicate a lack of support for the community beyond just not being offensive. \n\nAnother angle is that the author's actions led to being labeled as homophobic. Even if they didn't mean to be, if their words caused harm or discomfort to the other people, they might be in the wrong. The people might have felt that the author was trying to invalidate their identity or make them feel like their sexuality should be hidden. \n\nAlso, the author tried to hint first, but when that didn't work, they directly expressed their beliefs. It's possible that the other people took offense because they felt their identity was being criticized, even if the author's intent was to reduce the mentions. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered important to be accepting and not impose one's discomfort on others. If someone else's self-expression is causing discomfort, the onus is more on the person experiencing discomfort to manage their own feelings rather than asking the other person to change their behavior. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they are asking others to suppress their identity based on their personal discomfort, even if they claim not to have a problem with being gay. The other people's reaction of calling them homophobic might be an overreaction, but the author's request is problematic because it's about controlling others' self-expression. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
