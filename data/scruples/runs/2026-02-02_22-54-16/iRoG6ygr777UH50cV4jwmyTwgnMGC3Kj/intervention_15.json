However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says they met two gay people and initially liked them, but over time, they started to dislike them because the people made their sexuality too obvious. The author mentions that every other sentence included references to being gay, which made them uncomfortable. They tried subtly hinting that this was too much, and when that didn't work, they expressed their beliefs and got called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author states they don't have an issue with gay people and just want to keep their sexuality out of the conversation. However, the problem arises when the other people keep bringing up their identity so frequently. The author's main request is to not be reminded of their sexuality every few minutes, not to discriminate against them for it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Homosexuality is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity, and people often discuss their experiences as part of their identity. If someone is making a point to mention their sexuality in every conversation, perhaps they feel the need to assert it due to societal norms or personal experiences. However, the author is expressing discomfort not with the fact that they're gay, but with the frequency of the mentions.\n\nThe author tried to subtly hint at discomfort, then had to explain their stance. They were accused of being homophobic despite saying they accept them. The issue here might be a communication problem rather than a moral wrong. The author isn't discriminating against the people for being gay but is asking them to not mention it so often. However, respecting someone's identity includes acknowledging their self-expression. If the other individuals feel the need to discuss their sexuality, it's part of their authentic self, and the author's request to avoid that might conflict with the other person's right to express their identity.\n\nBut the author isn't denying them their rights; they're just expressing discomfort with the frequency. The problem might be that the author is trying to control the interaction by limiting how the other person can express their identity, which could be seen as dismissive or invalidating, even if unintentionally. On the other hand, if someone is making a person feel uncomfortable by overemphasizing their identity, the author might have a valid point about wanting respectful boundaries.\n\nIt's a tricky balance. The author isn't being openly hostile, but their discomfort led them to make a direct statement, which was met with accusations of homophobia. The key is whether the author's request is reasonable. If the other person is constantly bringing up their sexuality in a way that's intrusive, the author might have a right to ask for space. However, in social interactions, especially with people who are open about their identity, it's possible that such mentions are part of their natural communication style rather than being overdone.\n\nIn conclusion, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong for expressing discomfort, but they might have handled it poorly. However, the other individuals' reactions might be a result of feeling their identity was being invalidated. The answer could depend on cultural context and how the communication was framed. If the author was respectful and clear, they might not be wrong. But if their approach was dismissive, that's another matter. Given the description, the author tried to communicate subtlety first, so maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong.\n"
