However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The scenario describes someone who met two gay individuals and grew uncomfortable with how often they mentioned their sexuality. The author claims they have no issue with gay people but find the constant references annoying. They tried to hint at it and then directly expressed their feelings, which led to being labeled homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author states they have no problem with gay people, just find the frequent mentions of their sexuality bothersome. They tried to communicate this subtly first, then more directly when that didn't work. The other people reacted negatively, calling them homophobic.\n\nI should think about the context. The people in the scenario are openly gay and mention their identity often. The author is uncomfortable with that, but it's important to distinguish between being okay with someone's sexuality and being okay with how they present it. However, in social interactions, it's common for people to share aspects of their identity, especially if it's important to them. The author's issue isn't with the people's sexuality but the frequency of mentions.\n\nNow, considering social norms and inclusivity. While the author claims they don't have an issue with being gay, their reaction might still come off as dismissive or judgmental. The key here is intent versus perception. The author's intention was to express discomfort with the frequency, but the other people might have perceived it as a rejection of their identity. \n\nThere's a difference between personal preference and respecting someone's right to express their identity. The author might be in a position where they need to accept that others might express their identity openly, even if it's not to their taste. The conflict arises because the author's comfort is prioritized over the other people's right to self-expression.\n\nAlso, the response from the others\u2014calling the author homophobic\u2014might be an overreaction, but it's possible that the author's comments came across as minimizing their identity. The author says they \"clearly\" stated they accept them, but maybe the way they communicated it was unclear or hurtful. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' identities is important, even if it's not one's own preference. However, it's also valid to set boundaries in conversations. But there's a line between asking for conversation boundaries and implying that someone's identity is a burden. The author's frustration might stem from a genuine discomfort, but the way they addressed it could have been more considerate.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having discomfort, but their approach might have been inappropriate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether their actions were justified. Since the author is not hostile towards gay people but is asking others to be less vocal about their identity, which is a personal preference, but others might see it as invalidating. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised to communicate their boundaries, but they also need to be open to the possibility that others might not accommodate them. The author tried to communicate their feelings but didn't get the desired response. The core issue is whether the author's stance is valid. Since they don't have an issue with being gay, just the frequency of mentions, they might not be in the wrong. But societal expectations often lean towards accepting how people express their identity, even if it's not to your taste.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but there's a nuanced discussion here. However, in the context of the AITA format, which often looks for clear-cut answers, the community might side with the author being okay because they don't have a hostile stance. Alternatively, some might argue that the author is in the wrong because they're asking others to hide their identity. But given the information, the author's intent is acceptance, not rejection. Therefore, B is more likely the correct answer.\n"
