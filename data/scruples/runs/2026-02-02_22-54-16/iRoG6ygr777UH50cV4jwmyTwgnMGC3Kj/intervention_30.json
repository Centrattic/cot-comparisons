However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not caring about gay pride and getting called out for being homophobic even though they said they accept people for who they are.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author met two gay people and found their constant mention of their sexuality annoying. The author tried to hint they didn't want it mentioned so much, but when they directly stated their beliefs, they were labeled homophobic. The author argues they don't have a problem with being gay but just don't want it in their face.\n\nNow, considering the broader context. Acceptance vs. personal discomfort. The author isn't opposing being gay but is uncomfortable with the frequency of it being mentioned. Is it wrong to ask someone not to bring up their identity that much? But maybe the author's approach was problematic. The line between personal boundaries and respect for someone's identity.\n\nThe people the author is talking about might be expressing their identity, which is a fundamental right. If the author is uncomfortable, they might need to adjust their own feelings rather than ask others to suppress their identity. Also, the author's response of stating their beliefs might have come off as dismissive, even if their intent was to set a boundary.\n\nBut then, it's also about personal space. The author might feel that their social interactions are being overwhelmed by constant references. However, the issue is whether the author's actions were respectful. The people have the right to express their identity, and the author's request to not mention it frequently could be seen as invalidating that experience.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that people should not be compelled to hide their identity. So if the author is asking others to be less open about their sexuality, that's the problem. The author's approach of stating their beliefs might have been too direct, leading to conflict. They might have been in the wrong for not respecting the others' need to express their identity freely, even if it made them uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are requesting others to suppress their identity, which is not acceptable, even if their intention is to avoid discomfort. The key here is that the author's discomfort doesn't justify asking others to hide who they are.\n"
