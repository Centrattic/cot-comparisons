However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes!

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is wrong for not caring about gay pride and being bothered by others being openly gay. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they have two friends who are gay. They started to dislike them because the friends made their sexuality too obvious, mentioning it in every sentence. The author says they don't have an issue with being gay but don't support gay pride. They just want the friends to stop mentioning it so much. When they tried to hint and then directly tell them, they were called homophobic.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's discomfort with the friends' constant mention of their sexuality, their stance that they don't support gay pride but accept people, and the friends' reaction. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and respect for others' identities. Being openly gay is a fundamental right, and individuals have the right to express their identity. If the author is okay with the friends being gay but is annoyed by them mentioning it, that's a problem. It's not the friends' responsibility to hide their identity to make others comfortable. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014hinting and then telling the friends to stop\u2014could be seen as invalidating their need to be authentic. Even if the author doesn't support gay pride, they need to respect the friends' right to express their identity. The friends might feel that the author is being judgmental, even if they claim not to be. \n\nAlso, the author's statement that they \"don't support them\" but just want to be left alone is problematic. Acceptance isn't about active support but about respecting others' existence. The author's request to stop mentioning their sexuality could be seen as trying to erase or downplay an essential part of their identity, which is a form of discrimination or microaggression.\n\nThe friends' reaction of calling them homophobic and unaccepting might be justified if the author's actions made them feel that their identity was a problem. The author's discomfort shouldn't override the friends' right to be themselves. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be overtly bigoted, their behavior crosses into problematic territory by expecting others to hide their identity for their own comfort. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
