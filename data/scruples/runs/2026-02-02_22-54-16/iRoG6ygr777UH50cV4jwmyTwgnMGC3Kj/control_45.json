However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author says they met two gay people and initially liked them, but then started disliking them because they kept mentioning their sexuality too much. The author feels uncomfortable and says they don't have a problem with gay people but don't support it. They tried to hint the other people to stop mentioning it, then told them their beliefs and got called homophobic. The question is whether the author is wrong here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author is not opposed to gay people but is bothered by them constantly mentioning their sexuality. The problem is the frequency of the mentions, not the sexuality itself. The author tried to address it subtly and then more directly but was met with accusations of being homophobic despite stating they accept them.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. From a social perspective, it's important to respect people's identities, but also, no one is obligated to engage with others if they're uncomfortable. However, the line here is about whether the author's reaction is justified. The author isn't expressing hate; they're expressing discomfort with the frequency of mention. The other people might feel the need to mention their identity due to various reasons, like being in a minority or wanting to be open about their identity. \n\nBut the author's issue isn't with the fact that they are gay, but with how often it's brought up. The problem arises when the author tried to express this. The other people accused them of being homophobic, which might be a misunderstanding. The author emphasized they accept them, so maybe the other people didn't hear that or felt defensive. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable with constant mentions of someone's sexual orientation if it's not relevant to the conversation. However, the way they addressed it might have been inappropriate. The author tried to hint first, then state their beliefs. But in a society that values open discussion of identity, others might see the author's request as invalidating. \n\nBut the key is that the author isn't opposing LGBTQ+ rights, just not supporting them actively. The problem is more about personal boundaries. The author's actions (trying to communicate discomfort) might be seen as okay if done respectfully, but they were accused of being intolerant. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to discuss it constantly. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions crossed a line into being intolerant. Since the author is not opposing the people for being gay but is bothered by the frequency, they might not be in the wrong. However, the other people might feel their identity is being dismissed. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's intention was to express discomfort, not hatred. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
