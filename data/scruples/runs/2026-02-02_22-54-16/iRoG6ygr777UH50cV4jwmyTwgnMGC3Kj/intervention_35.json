However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author met two gay people who kept emphasizing their sexuality, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint and then directly expressed their discomfort, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the author's statements. They say they don't have an issue with gay people but find the constant mention of being gay annoying. The key here is whether the author's reaction is valid or if they are overstepping.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's important to respect people's identities, but also to acknowledge that people might express their identity in ways that others find distracting. However, the author's approach might be problematic. Telling someone to stop mentioning their sexuality could be seen as dismissing their identity or making them feel like they shouldn't be open about who they are. That could be hurtful, even if the author's intention was just to reduce the frequency of the mentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their own discomfort. They aren't opposed to being around gay people but want to avoid the topic. The problem arises when the author's response leads to conflict. The friends reacted with resentment, thinking the author was being homophobic. The author claims they accepted their sexuality but just found the constant references annoying. \n\nThe question is whether it's reasonable to expect someone to stop talking about their identity. People often discuss their identity as part of their self-expression, especially in contexts where it's relevant. If the author found it intrusive, maybe they should have communicated their boundaries more carefully. However, the author's actions\u2014first hinting, then stating their beliefs\u2014might have been direct but not necessarily wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the friends' perspective. If they felt the author was trying to suppress their identity, that's a valid concern. The author's approach might come off as invalidating, even if they didn't mean it that way. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's discomfort is understandable, their method of addressing it could be seen as inconsiderate of the friends' needs to express their identity. This might place the author in the wrong because they prioritized their own comfort over the friends' right to self-expression, leading to conflict. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
