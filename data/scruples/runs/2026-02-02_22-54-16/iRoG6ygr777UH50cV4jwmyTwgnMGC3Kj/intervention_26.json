However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and being annoyed by their friends constantly mentioning their sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met two gay people and initially liked them. But over time, they started to dislike them because they made their sexuality too obvious. The author doesn't have an issue with being gay but doesn't support gay pride, and they find the constant mentions uncomfortable. They tried to hint and then openly expressed their feelings, leading to being called homophobic, even though they said they accept their friends' sexuality.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about acceptance and boundaries. The author's friends are openly discussing their identities, which might be important to them. The author is not against their sexuality but is bothered by the frequency of mentions. The friends reacted negatively, calling them homophobic. The author claims they don't have an issue and just want to avoid the topic.\n\nSo, from a social perspective, respect for others' identities is crucial. Even if someone is uncomfortable with the frequency of mentions, it's important to consider why the friends might feel the need to bring it up. They might be affirming their identity, dealing with past experiences of discrimination, or sharing in a safe space. The author's frustration could stem from personal discomfort, but that doesn't necessarily mean their friends are overstepping unless it's being forced upon them.\n\nHowever, the author did express their discomfort, both subtly and directly. The friends interpreted this as homophobia. Maybe the author's approach wasn't respectful enough, or perhaps the friends felt their identity was being invalidated. The author's stance of \"keep it out of it\" might be seen as not supporting their friends' authentic selves, even if they don't hate them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't opposed to gay people but just wants to avoid the topic. There's a difference between not supporting activism and not wanting to discuss a personal aspect of someone's identity if it's not relevant. But in a close relationship, where identity is a part of who someone is, avoiding the topic entirely could be seen as not accepting them fully. \n\nI think the author's main mistake is not understanding that their friends' need to discuss their sexuality is part of their authentic self. Even if it's uncomfortable, the author's reaction to express that discomfort might have been misinterpreted or not handled sensitively. The friends' reaction suggests that they feel their identity is important and should be acknowledged, so the author's desire to avoid it might come off as dismissive.\n\nBut the author isn't discriminatory; they just have a different boundary. The issue here is about personal boundaries versus respect for identity. The line between the two can be blurry. If the friends are making it an issue, maybe the author needs to find a middle ground. However, the author isn't in the wrong for having those feelings, but they might need to communicate better. The friends' response might be overly harsh if the author is genuinely accepting but just uncomfortable with the frequency.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were inconsiderate or if the friends overreacted. Since the author tried to address it and still faced backlash, it's possible that the friends felt their identity was being invalidated. The author's stance isn't malicious, but their approach might have been flawed. However, the core of the issue is about differing expectations in communication and boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for their feelings, but they might need to navigate the situation more thoughtfully.\n"
