However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and found them annoying because they kept mentioning their sexuality a lot. The author says they don't have a problem with being gay but don't support gay pride and got called homophobic for not wanting to hear about it so much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author claims they don't have an issue with gay people but just want them to keep their sexuality to themselves. They tried to hint at it but then directly told them, leading to being accused of being homophobic. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not caring about gay pride and finding the frequent mentions of being gay uncomfortable. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but others might disagree. \n\nI should think about the social norms around discussing personal identity. People often share aspects of their identity, like being part of the LGBTQ+ community, as part of their self-expression. If someone is being open about their identity, it's a part of who they are. The author is uncomfortable because it's \"every other sentence,\" which might be the issue. But the author also says they don't support gay pride, which could be seen as problematic even if their intent isn't to discriminate. \n\nThe line between personal discomfort and prejudice is important here. The author might be in the wrong if they're unwilling to accept others' expressions of their identity, even if they don't support the broader movement. Also, being called homophobic might be a reaction to the author's lack of support for the community beyond just not being prejudiced against individuals. \n\nAnother angle is that the author's request for others to not mention their sexuality could be seen as invalidating their identity. If someone is being open about being gay, it's part of their identity, and expecting them to hide it might be an issue. However, if the author isn't discriminating against them but just finds it annoying, there's a nuance. \n\nBut the problem might be that the author isn't just not supporting the movement but is also expressing discomfort with how the individuals are expressing their identity. This could be seen as closeted prejudice because they are not supportive of the community's expressions, even if they tolerate individuals. \n\nIn conclusion, considering that the author is not accepting of the public expression of others' sexuality and even resists the broader movement, they might be in the wrong because true acceptance includes respecting how others choose to express their identity, even if it's not something the author actively supports.\n"
