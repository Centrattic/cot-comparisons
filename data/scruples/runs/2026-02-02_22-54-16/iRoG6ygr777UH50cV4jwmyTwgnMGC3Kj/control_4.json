However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, which made the author uncomfortable. The author tried to subtly hint about it but then was called homophobic when they expressed their feelings more directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but find it annoying that the others are so open about their sexuality. They wanted them to stop mentioning it so much. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way.\n\nFrom a social perspective, people have the right to express their identity openly. If someone is being their authentic self, others can't demand them to suppress that unless there's a specific context where it's inappropriate. The author's discomfort might stem from their own biases or discomfort with difference, even if they claim not to have a problem with being gay. \n\nThe author tried to address the issue by hinting and then directly stating their feelings. However, when met with accusations of being homophobic, the author is confused because they don't consider themselves prejudiced. It's possible that the author's actions, while not malicious, come across as dismissive of the other people's identities. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is uncomfortable with the frequency of the mentions but can't articulate a valid reason beyond \"it's just annoying\" might be seen as invalidating the other person's need to be authentic. It's important to consider that people often discuss their identity as part of their self-expression, and others shouldn't make them feel they have to hide it. \n\nSo, in this case, the author might be in the wrong because their request for the others to be less open about their sexuality could be seen as trying to control how others express themselves, even if they claim not to have a problem with their identity. The line between personal discomfort and discrimination is thin here. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong, because they are inadvertently promoting a suppression of the other's identity, which is a form of prejudice, even if unintentional.\n"
