However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) question is in the wrong. The author says they have no issue with gay people but find it annoying when two friends they met keep mentioning their sexuality frequently. The author tried to subtly hint that it's too much and then directly expressed their feelings, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author states they don't have a problem with being gay, just that the constant mentions make them uncomfortable. The friends are openly discussing their identities, which they have the right to do. The author's issue isn't with the friends' sexuality but with the frequency of the mentions. However, when they tried to address it, they faced backlash.\n\nNow, I should think about social norms. People often express their identities, especially in supportive environments. The friends might feel it's important to share their experiences as part of being authentic. The author's reaction could be seen as dismissing the significance of their identity. Even if the author is respectful, the friends might feel their identity is being minimized by not wanting it mentioned. \n\nLegal and ethical aspects: There's no law against someone expressing their sexuality, so the friends are within their rights. The author's discomfort doesn't justify the friends' actions. However, it's a social issue. The author's approach might come off as invalidating the friends' need to be open about their identity. \n\nThe author did make an effort to address it politely first, but the friends didn't stop. When the author was more direct, they were met with accusations. It's possible the author's message wasn't communicated clearly, or the friends felt attacked, even if the author didn't mean to be. \n\nAnother angle: The author's stance is \"live and let live,\" but in this case, it's about the friends' choice to be open. The author's discomfort might be a personal preference, but the friends have the right to express themselves. The author's actions could be seen as not respecting the friends' self-expression, even if they aren't being hostile. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't being openly homophobic, but their reaction might be perceived as dismissive of the friends' identity. The friends have the right to discuss their sexuality, and the author's discomfort doesn't override that. Therefore, the author's approach might be inconsiderate, leading them to be in the wrong.\n"
