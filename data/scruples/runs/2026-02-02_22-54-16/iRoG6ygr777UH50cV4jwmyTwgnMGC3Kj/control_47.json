However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not caring about gay pride. They met two gay people who kept mentioning their sexuality a lot, which made them uncomfortable. The person says they don't have an issue with gay people but just don't want them to bring it up so much. They tried hinting and then openly saying they didn't like it, got called homophobic, and now they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't opposed to gay people but is annoyed at the constant reminders. They want people to just be themselves without bringing up their sexuality so much. But is it okay to ask others to not mention their identity?\n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to express their identity. If someone is gay and chooses to mention it, they shouldn't be made to feel like they need to hide that part of themselves. The author's discomfort might stem from personal preference, but it's not fair to pressure others to suppress their identity for the author's comfort. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't big on gay pride and doesn't see the need to support it. They just want people to be themselves without the constant references. But the problem arises when their dislike of the constant mentions leads to others feeling targeted or unaccepted. Even if the author says they accept them, the pushback from the gay individuals could mean that the author's actions (asking them to stop being open about their sexuality) come off as invalidating.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author was labeled as homophobic and unaccepting despite their claims suggests that their approach might have been perceived as such. Even if the intention was just to express personal discomfort, the effect could be harmful. People might see it as a demand to closet themselves, which is a form of discrimination.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that people should be able to express their identity freely. Criticizing someone for being open about their sexuality can be seen as judgmental. So the author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friends' right to discuss their identity, even if it's uncomfortable for them.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they are contributing to an environment where others can't freely express their identity without pushback, even if their intent is just personal discomfort.\n"
