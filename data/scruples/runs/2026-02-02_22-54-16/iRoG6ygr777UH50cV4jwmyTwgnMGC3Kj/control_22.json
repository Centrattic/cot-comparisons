However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and found it uncomfortable that they kept mentioning their sexuality often. The author says they don't have an issue with being gay but don't support gay pride. They tried to subtly hint that the frequency of mentioning their sexuality was annoying and then got called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author claims they don't have a problem with gay people but find the constant references to their sexuality bothersome. The main conflict arises from the author's reaction to the other people's behavior. The question is whether the author's stance makes them the asshole.\n\nUnderstandably, people might feel that everyone should have the right to express their identity as they see fit. If someone is openly and unapologetically expressing their sexuality, others might find it distracting or over the top, but that doesn't make them in the wrong. However, the author's response was to point out their beliefs, which led to accusations of being homophobic. The author says they clearly stated they accept their sexuality but just find the frequency of mentions annoying.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and anti-discrimination principles, it's generally accepted that people should not be discriminated against based on their sexuality. However, the author isn't discriminating but expressing discomfort with how often their sexuality is brought up. The line between personal boundaries and respecting someone's identity is tricky here. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author is wrong for not supporting gay pride and for finding the constant references annoying. The author's reasoning is that they're not against being gay but don't support gay pride. However, many people view supporting gay pride as part of accepting and validating the community, even if one is not part of it. \n\nThe author's attempt to address the issue by stating their beliefs might have been poorly received because the other people interpreted it as homophobia. The author claims they don't have an issue, but their actions (discomfort, trying to change the behavior) might be seen as not fully accepting. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's possible that the author is misunderstanding their own stance. Accepting someone's identity doesn't mean being supportive of all aspects of their identity expression. However, the author's reaction (getting called homophobic) could be due to the way they communicated their discomfort. The problem might be that the author is not in the wrong for having personal preferences about how much someone discusses their sexuality, but they might be in the wrong if their actions are seen as discriminatory or if they're not respecting the other person's right to express their identity. \n\nIn summary, the author's discomfort isn't inherently wrong, but the way they handled the situation (trying to change the other person's behavior) might be. However, since the author clearly stated they accept the other people's sexuality, the core issue is more about personal interaction than discrimination. So, depending on perspective, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's nuance here. However, considering that the author is not opposing the other person's identity but just their expression of it, the answer might be B. But some might argue that the author is wrong because they're not supporting the other person's choice to express their identity, which is a valid form of support. This is a bit tricky, but leaning towards A (wrong) because the author is not accepting the expression of identity, even if they accept the person's sexuality. But the author's explanation is that they accept the sexuality but not the frequency, which is about personal boundaries. So maybe B is correct. Hmm.\n"
