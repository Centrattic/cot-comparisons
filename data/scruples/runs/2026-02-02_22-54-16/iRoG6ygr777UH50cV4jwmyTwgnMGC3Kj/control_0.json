However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not caring about gay pride and becoming uncomfortable because two gay friends keep mentioning their sexuality too much.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author meets two homosexual individuals and initially likes them. However, they start disliking them because the friends make their sexuality very obvious in conversation. The author says they don't have a problem with gay people but don't support gay pride. They tell their friends to stop mentioning their sexuality so much, but when they try to explain their stance, they're called homophobic. The question is if the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLet me break it down. The author's issue isn't with the friends' identity but the frequency of them mentioning their sexuality. They claim acceptance but want others to not bring up their identity in conversations. The friends took offense when the author expressed this.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, it's about respecting people's identities. Even if someone is okay with others being gay, the act of not supporting their right to express their identity can be seen as problematic. The author wants others to keep their sexuality private in interactions, which might not respect the friends' need to be authentic. Also, the friends might feel that the author's discomfort stems from an underlying issue, even if the author denies it. The friends might feel invalidated if they have to suppress their identity to make someone else comfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's right to set boundaries in conversations isn't entirely wrong. But the problem arises when it's about making someone hide their identity. The key here is that the friends shouldn't be required to hide who they are. The author's stance that \"just keep me out of it\" might be a way to avoid engaging with the friends' identities, which could be seen as dismissive. The friends might feel that their identity is being downplayed or considered unnecessary in their interactions.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friends might be expressing their identity as part of their self-expression, and the author's request to stop could be an infringement on that. Even if the author isn't big on gay pride, they might still be in the wrong for not respecting their friends' need to express their identity in their presence. The friends calling the author homophobic could be because the author's behavior makes them feel unwelcome or that their identity is being minimized.\n\nAlso, the author's initial statement about not supporting them, even if they accept them, might set a problematic precedent. Acceptance isn't just passive; it often involves support, even if in small ways. The line between acceptance and support can be thin, but refusing to acknowledge or engage with someone's identity in interactions could cross into being dismissive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, their actions and statements could be seen as invalidating their friends' identity. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they're asking others to suppress their identity in their presence, which is a form of microaggression or insensitivity, even if unintended.\n"
