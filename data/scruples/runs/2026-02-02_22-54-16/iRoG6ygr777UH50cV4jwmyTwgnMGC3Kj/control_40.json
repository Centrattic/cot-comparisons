However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people who kept bringing up their sexuality a lot, making the author uncomfortable. The author tried to hint they should stop, then directly expressed their feelings, leading to being called homophobic even though they said they accept them. The question is whether the author is wrong for not caring about gay pride and being bothered by the constant mentions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has no issue with being gay but feels that the two individuals are making it too obvious and annoying. They tried to hint and then directly communicate their discomfort. The friends took offense, calling them homophobic. \n\nFrom a social justice perspective, it's important to note that individuals are allowed to express their identity as they choose. However, the author isn't opposing their sexuality; they're just asking them to be less vocal about it. But the friends perceived this as rejection, especially since the author didn't express support for LGBTQ+ issues. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author's right to not be annoyed by the constant mentions is more important than the individuals' right to express their identity. Also, does the author have a responsibility to support gay pride, even if they're not personally invested?\n\nIn many societies, there's an expectation of active support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ communities. Being neutral or not supportive can be seen as problematic, even if there's no direct hostility. The author's discomfort stems from the frequency of mentions, not the sexuality itself, but their response might have been perceived as invalidating the friends' need to express their identity.\n\nThe friends might feel that their identity is integral to who they are and that the author's request to keep it separate is a form of erasure. The author's stance of \"just keep me out of it\" might not align with societal expectations of being inclusive and supportive. \n\nHowever, the author isn't denying the friends' identity or expressing hatred. They're simply expressing a personal preference to not have it discussed. The line here is between personal boundaries and social responsibilities. The friends' reaction suggests that the author's approach was harmful, even if unintended. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as insensitive or not fully supportive, even if they have no ill intent. Therefore, the answer might lean towards \"Yes, the author is in the wrong\" because they failed to provide active support and their discomfort led to a dismissive attitude towards the friends' identity expression.\n"
