However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who met two gay people and found their frequent references to their sexuality annoying. The author states they don't have an issue with gay people but feel uncomfortable with the constant mentions. They tried to hint and then directly told the others to stop, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's problem isn't with the people's sexuality per se but with how often they mention it. The author claims acceptance but wants others not to bring it up. The friends, however, felt hurt and called the author homophobic. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author's actions: expressing discomfort with the frequency of mentions, which led to conflict. The friends might feel that their identity is important and that the author is dismissing a part of who they are. Even if the author says they're okay with being gay, the friends might see the complaints as invalidating their experience or implying that being gay is a problem that should be hidden. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that their personal preference to not discuss the topic shouldn't be seen as homophobia. But in reality, telling someone not to express their identity could be seen as trying to suppress it, even if unintentionally. Also, the friends might feel pressured to hide their authentic selves, which can be hurtful.\n\nLegally and socially, discrimination based on sexuality is wrong, but this is more about personal boundaries. However, in the context of friendships, respecting each other's identities is crucial. The author's discomfort might not be malicious, but the response from the friends is valid because their identity is part of who they are. The author's approach of asking them to stop mentioning it could be seen as insensitive, even if they don't hold negative views. \n\nAnother angle: the definition of homophobia. Homophobia is the fear or hatred of LGBTQ+ individuals, but even if the author isn't hateful, the act of asking others to hide their identity can perpetuate a hostile environment. It's possible the author is in denial of their own discomfort, thinking they're neutral but actually contributing to the other person's marginalization.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not have malicious intent, their actions could be hurtful. The friends are within their rights to feel offended, as the author's request to stop discussing their identity may come across as dismissive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the importance of the friends' identities in their interactions.\n"
