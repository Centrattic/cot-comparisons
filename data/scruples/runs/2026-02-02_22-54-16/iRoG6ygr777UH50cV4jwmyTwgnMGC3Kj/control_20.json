However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author meeting two gay people who they initially liked but then started disliking because those individuals made their homosexuality very apparent in every conversation. The author tried to subtly hint that they were mentioning their sexuality too much, and when that didn't work, they expressed their feelings more directly and were labeled as homophobic, despite clarifying they don't have an issue with being gay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author states they don't have a problem with gay people but find it annoying when it's brought up frequently. However, the key point here is that the individuals in question are openly discussing their identity, which is a fundamental part of who they are. It's their right to express their sexuality, especially if they feel they need to in certain contexts. The author's discomfort stems from the frequency rather than the content itself.\n\nNext, the author tried to subtly hint at the issue, which is a reasonable approach. But when that didn't work, they directly expressed their beliefs. The problem arises because the author's main issue is with the frequency of the mentions, not the content. However, the friends might feel that their identity is being dismissed or that the author is uncomfortable with their authentic selves. Even if the author says they accept them, the pushback against their self-expression could be seen as invalidating.\n\nAlso, it's important to consider that people often mention their identity when it's relevant to the conversation. If the friends are bringing it up every few minutes without context, that might be excessive. But it's also possible that the author is being overly sensitive. The friends might feel that they can't be their true selves around the author, which is a significant issue in relationships.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, respecting someone's identity is crucial. If the friends feel the author is making them feel uncomfortable about being open, that's a problem. The author's request to \"keep me out of it\" might imply a desire for others to hide aspects of themselves, which could be seen as discriminatory. Even if the author isn't opposed to being gay, wanting others to suppress their identity for the author's comfort can be problematic.\n\nHowever, the author isn't opposed to being gay; their issue is with the frequency. It's a nuanced situation. The friends might be overcompensating or seeking validation, but the author has a right to their comfort. The line between being accepting and being annoyed is thin here. The friends' reaction of calling the author homophobic might be an overreaction if the author clearly stated they accept them. But if the friends felt their identity is being downplayed, that's a genuine concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's problem isn't with the friends' sexuality itself but with how often they mention it. The friends might be doing it for various reasons, but the author's approach of expressing discomfort directly could be seen as invalidating. However, the friends' response of labeling the author as homophobic might be an overreaction if the author is clear about acceptance. The core issue is about boundaries and mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong for having a preference, but their approach might have been misguided. However, the friends also have the right to express their identity. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being the asshole because they didn't express hate, just discomfort with frequency. But there's a strong argument that wanting others to hide their identity is problematic. Hmm.\n"
