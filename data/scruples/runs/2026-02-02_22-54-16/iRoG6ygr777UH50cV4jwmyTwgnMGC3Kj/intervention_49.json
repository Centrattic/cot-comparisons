However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author mentions that they met two gay individuals and gradually started disliking them because they felt the people were being overly vocal about their sexuality, inserting phrases like \"being a gay woman\" into every conversation. The author tried to hint that this was excessive and later expressed their beliefs, which led to being labeled as homophobic, even though they stated they don't have an issue with gay people and just want them to keep their sexuality to themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author's main issue isn't with the people's sexuality itself but with how frequently they mention it. The author claims they have no problem with gay people but finds the constant emphasis on their identity annoying. The question is whether this stance is wrong.\n\nFrom a social perspective, while it's true that everyone has the right to express their identity, others also have the right to their own boundaries. The author isn't opposing the people's sexuality but is uncomfortable with how it's being highlighted. However, the problem arises when the author tried to address this by stating their beliefs, which led to conflict. The friends took offense, perceiving it as homophobia. \n\nBut the author insists they accept the people's sexuality and just want them to stop mentioning it so often. The challenge here is balancing personal expression with others' comfort. People often feel it's important to be open about their identity, especially if it's a significant part of who they are. The author's request to not mention their sexuality is a personal preference, but it might not account for the other individuals' need to express themselves.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, acceptance is about respecting others' identities, including how they choose to present themselves. However, it's also about respecting others' boundaries. But in this case, the author's discomfort stems from the frequency, not the content. The key issue is whether the author overstepped by expressing their discomfort, leading to being labeled as homophobic. \n\nThe author might argue they're not against being gay but want it to be less intrusive. However, the friends might feel that the author's rejection of their self-identification is a form of acceptance, even if it's not. The line between personal space and accepting someone's identity can be blurry here. The author's approach could be seen as invalidating the importance of their friends' identity, even if unintentionally. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's problem isn't with the people's sexuality but their self-identification frequency. While the author might not have malicious intent, their actions could still be perceived as dismissive. However, they are not in the wrong for having personal boundaries. The main conflict is a misunderstanding between personal preferences and the other's expression of identity. So, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but there's nuance here about how to communicate boundaries without causing offense.\n"
