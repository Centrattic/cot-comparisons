However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author met two gay people and found it annoying that they constantly mentioned their sexuality. The author tried to hint at them to stop but when that didn't work, they stated their beliefs, leading to being called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author claims they don't have an issue with gay people and just want them to not mention their sexuality so much. The friends took offense when the author expressed this, even after the author clarified they accept them but just find the constant mentions uncomfortable.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it's important to respect people's identities. If someone is being open about their sexuality and it's part of how they express themselves, others might see it as part of their authentic self. The author's request to stop mentioning their sexuality could be seen as invalidating or making them feel uncomfortable for being themselves. Even if the author is trying to be neutral, the act of asking someone to downplay a fundamental part of their identity can come across as dismissive or intolerant.\n\nAlso, the friends responded by calling the author homophobic. The author insists they accept them, but the friends' reaction suggests that the way the author communicated their discomfort may have crossed a line. People might argue that while it's okay to have personal boundaries, demanding that someone else suppress their identity is not acceptable. The author might not be intentionally bigoted, but their actions could be perceived as such because they're prioritizing their own comfort over the other person's need to express themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they are in the right because they're not opposing the other person's sexuality, just finding the frequency annoying. However, in many social contexts, being asked to constantly affirm or hide one's identity can be stressful for LGBTQ+ individuals. There's a balance between personal preferences and respecting others' rights to express their identity freely.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally advised to be accepting and not make others feel they need to hide parts of themselves. The author's approach of trying to hint and then stating their beliefs might have been too direct or poorly communicated, leading to the conflict. The friends might feel that the author's discomfort with their identity is a form of homophobia, even if the author doesn't intend it as such.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they imposed their personal discomfort on the other person's right to express their identity. Even if they have good intentions, the result is that they caused the friends to feel unaccepted, which is a form of microaggression. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
