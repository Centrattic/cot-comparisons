However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable to not care about gay pride and to be uncomfortable with someone being openly gay. \n\nFirst, the user mentions they don't have an issue with gay people but get annoyed when others mention their sexuality frequently. They tried to hint and then directly express their discomfort, leading to being called homophobic. The key points here are acceptance versus personal discomfort.\n\nThe author says they accept people regardless of their sexuality but don't support or care about gay pride. However, the issue arises when the other people's openness makes them uncomfortable. The problem here might be that the author is asking others to hide their identity because of their discomfort, which can be seen as a form of microaggression or expecting others to conform to their personal space.\n\nIn many societies, it's considered respectful for individuals to express their identity freely without being forced to downplay it for others' comfort. So, if the author is asking the gay individuals to stop mentioning their sexuality, that could be seen as invalidating their identity. Even if the author isn't directly opposing homosexuality, creating an environment where others must hide their true selves could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the term \"homophobic\" might be a strong label, but if the author's actions caused the other party to feel unaccepted, there's a valid point there. The author's request for others to \"keep me out of it\" might conflict with the basic right of people to be open about their identity without facing pressure to be closeted.\n\nSo, the author's main mistake is expecting others to suppress a fundamental part of their identity due to the author's discomfort. Even if the author isn't actively hostile, the expectation to conform to their personal space can be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
