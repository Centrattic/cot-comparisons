However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author disliking how their friends, who are gay, frequently mention their sexuality. The author says they don't have an issue with being gay but find it annoying when it's brought up so often. They tried to subtly hint at this but when that didn't work, they shared their beliefs and were called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author doesn't have a problem with LGBTQ+ people, but they're uncomfortable with the constant mention of being gay. The friends might feel that their identity is important and that the author is not respecting their need to express it. But the author is also expressing a personal boundary about not wanting to hear about it so frequently.\n\nNow, in terms of societal norms, it's generally accepted that people should be free to express their identity without judgment. However, the author is not opposing their friends' sexuality, just the frequency of mentioning it. The issue arises when the author's discomfort leads them to express their views, which the friends took as homophobia. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if someone is making it a central topic of conversation, others might find it overwhelming. However, the friends might feel that their identity is being invalidated if others don't want to acknowledge it. The line between respecting someone's identity and finding the frequency of mentions annoying is a bit fuzzy here. \n\nThe author's approach was to first hint subtly, which didn't work, then to state their beliefs. But even if they said they accept their friends' sexuality, the friends might feel that the author is not fully accepting if they're uncomfortable with the mentions. The friends might see it as a form of microaggression or not being fully inclusive. \n\nHowever, the author isn't discriminating against their friends because they're gay; they're just upset about the frequency. The friends, on the other hand, might have a right to express their identity as part of who they are. The conflict here is about personal boundaries versus expression of identity. \n\nIn many cases, people are encouraged to express their truths, but there's also a balance in respecting others' comfort. The author might not be in the wrong for not wanting to hear it constantly, but they might have approached it in a way that didn't validate their friends' feelings. However, the friends' response of calling them homophobic could be an overreaction if the author isn't actually opposing their identity. \n\nStill, the core issue is whether not wanting to hear about someone's sexuality frequently is acceptable. It's a personal preference, but in a respectful environment, people should be able to express their preferences. However, if the friends felt their identity was being dismissed, that's a different angle. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's stance isn't necessarily wrong because they're not opposing their friends' sexuality. They're just expressing a personal boundary. The friends might have overstepped by interpreting it as homophobia. Therefore, the author might not be the asshole here.\n"
