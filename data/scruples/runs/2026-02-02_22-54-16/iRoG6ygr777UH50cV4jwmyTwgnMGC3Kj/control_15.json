However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not caring about gay pride and getting annoyed when their friends mention their sexuality too often.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met two gay people and initially liked them. But over time, the author started disliking them because they kept mentioning their sexuality in every conversation. The author tried to hint that they didn't want that, then openly expressed their discomfort but got called homophobic. The key here is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nThe author claims they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support them. They just want their friends to keep their sexuality to themselves. The friends felt unaccepted, even though the author explicitly said they accept their sexuality.\n\nNow, considering the principles of respect and acceptance. LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination and may feel the need to assert their identity in social settings. If someone is being open about their identity, which is a personal choice, the author's discomfort might stem from not wanting to engage with that aspect. However, the friends might feel invalidated if they perceive the author is avoiding acknowledging their identity, which is a core part of who they are.\n\nThe author's stance of \"I don't support them\" could be problematic. Support can mean different things, but acceptance is about respecting someone's identity without requiring them to conform to a certain way. The author's request to not mention their sexuality could be seen as wanting them to hide a fundamental part of themselves, which is essentially what homophobia often demands. Even if the author isn't actively hostile, the request might be a form of microaggression.\n\nAlso, the friends' reaction of calling the author homophobic suggests that they felt disrespected. It's possible the author's actions, while not overtly discriminatory, did create an environment where the friends felt their identity wasn't fully accepted. The line between personal boundaries and respecting someone's identity is thin here. \n\nIn many social contexts, especially where marginalized groups are involved, people may feel the need to express their identity more openly as a form of validation or pride. The author's discomfort in this case might overlook the importance of that expression for their friends. The author's approach might not be malicious, but it could still be hurtful by implying that their friends' identities are something to be minimized or hidden.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong not because they have a different stance on gay pride, but because their actions could be seen as invalidating their friends' need to express their identity openly. The key is that acceptance involves respecting how others present themselves, even if it's not something you personally find important.\n"
