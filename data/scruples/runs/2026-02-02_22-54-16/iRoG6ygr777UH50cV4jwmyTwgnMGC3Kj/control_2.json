However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong.\n\nThe author says they met two gay individuals but started disliking them because they constantly mentioned their sexuality. The author claims they don't have an issue with gay people but finds the constant references annoying. They tried to hint and then directly express their discomfort, leading to being called homophobic even though they insisted they accept the individuals' sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is justified in their feelings. The key point here is that the author is uncomfortable with how often the others bring up their sexuality, not the fact that they are gay. The author acknowledges that being gay is okay but wants them to not mention it so much. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, people often feel they should be accepted for who they are, including their identity. If someone is openly discussing their identity, it's part of their self-expression. The author's request might seem reasonable in a private context, but in social interactions, people might expect others to talk about aspects of their identity that are relevant to the conversation. However, if the author is in a position where they are being intrusive or making others uncomfortable, that's different.\n\nThe author tried to address their discomfort first subtly, then directly. The others responded by calling them homophobic, which the author argues they aren't. The issue here is whether the author's request to not mention their sexuality is valid or if it's a form of microaggression or indirect discrimination. \n\nIn many societies, there's an emphasis on not making others feel invalidated for their identity. If someone feels they have to constantly explain or downplay their sexuality because others find it uncomfortable, that could be a problem. The author's discomfort might be seen as putting the onus on the gay individuals to adjust their behavior, which could be unfair. \n\nAlso, the author's statement \"I wouldn't go as far as to say I support them\" is significant. It suggests a lack of active support, which might be a red flag even if they don't hold prejudice. Not supporting someone's community or events (like gay pride) isn't necessarily wrong, but if it's leading to discomfort or being used as a justification for not being fully accepting, it could be problematic.\n\nThe key factors are intent and impact. The author's intent isn't to harm but to avoid discomfort from frequent mentions of sexuality. However, the impact is that their request might be seen as invalidating the other person's identity. The others felt the author was being homophobic because the request could be perceived as wanting them to hide their identity.\n\nIn many discussions about LGBTQ+ issues, there's a focus on allowing people to be open and proud without feeling the need to conceal their identity to make others comfortable. So, the author's stance might be considered inconsiderate of the other person's needs to express their identity openly.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because their request to not mention their sexuality is placing the burden on the individuals to adjust, which could be seen as a form of subtle discrimination. The author is not directly hostile but is creating discomfort by not supporting the other's right to self-expression.\n"
