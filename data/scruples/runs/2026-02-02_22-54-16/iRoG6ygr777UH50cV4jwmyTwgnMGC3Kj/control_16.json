However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for not caring about gay pride and being bothered by their friends constantly mentioning their sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The author met two gay individuals and initially liked them, but became uncomfortable when they kept emphasizing their sexuality. The author doesn't have a problem with being gay but finds the constant reminders annoying. They tried to hint at this discomfort but were met with accusations of being homophobic when they finally expressed their views.\n\nNow, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Homosexuality is protected under anti-discrimination laws in many places, and LGBTQ+ individuals have the right to express their identity. However, the author's issue isn't with being gay itself but with the frequency of the mention. The problem here might be whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nThe author says they don't have an issue with gay people but just want them to keep their sexuality to themselves. This could be seen as a request for privacy or personal space. However, it's also possible that the author is uncomfortable not with the sexuality but with the visibility of it, which could overlap with homophobia, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe friends might feel that their identity is integral to who they are, and they should be able to express it without fear of backlash. If the author is suggesting that they shouldn't be open about their sexuality, that could be viewed as contributing to a hostile environment, even if the author's intention is just to avoid discomfort. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, allyship often involves respecting someone's identity and not making them feel they need to hide it. The author's frustration with the constant mentions might be valid in terms of personal preference, but in the context of social acceptance, expecting others to suppress their identity could be problematic. \n\nAlso, when the author directly expressed their views and was called out as homophobic, it's possible that the friends misinterpreted the comments, especially if the author's words were taken as a rejection of their identity. The line between personal discomfort and prejudice can be thin here. \n\nIn summary, the author's stance might not be malicious, but by requesting that others hide their sexuality, which is a core part of who they are, the author could be in the wrong. Society generally encourages acceptance and openness rather than hiding one's identity. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because their discomfort leads them to expect others to suppress their identity, which is not acceptable.\n"
