However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes! Am I the asshole for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author not caring about gay pride and becoming uncomfortable with friends who are openly gay and mention their sexuality frequently. The author tried to subtly hint that they don't want to hear about it so much and then faced backlash when they expressed their feelings more directly.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author says they don't have an issue with gay people but find the constant mention of their sexuality annoying. They tried to address it, but when they spoke up, they were called homophobic. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom a general perspective, respecting someone's identity is important. However, the author is expressing discomfort with how frequently the friends bring up their sexuality, not with the fact that they are gay. The friends might feel that the author is not accepting of their identity if they downplay it. But the author argues that they accept them but just don't want it to be a constant topic. \n\nThere's a balance between respecting someone's identity and personal boundaries. However, in many cases, when someone is part of a marginalized group, they might feel the need to assert their identity in social interactions, especially in spaces where they are underrepresented. The author's friends might feel that the author is not fully accepting if they don't engage with their identity, even if the author is okay with their existence. \n\nOn the other hand, it's also valid to have personal boundaries. The author isn't rejecting their friends for being gay but is asking them not to mention it excessively. However, the friends might perceive this as the author not being accepting of their identity because they don't want to acknowledge it. \n\nIn terms of social norms, especially in more progressive circles, there's an emphasis on being vocal about acceptance and support. So the author's stance of \"just keep me out of it\" might be seen as not supporting them actively, even if they mean no harm. But the author isn't opposing their identity; they just don't want to engage with it in their interactions. \n\nThe friends' reaction of calling the author homophobic could be based on their perception that the author is not supporting their identity by not engaging with it. But the author claims they accept them, so maybe the friends misunderstood. The key point is whether the author's request is a form of subtle rejection. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's position might not be malicious, but in the context of social expectations, they might still be seen as not fully supporting their friends' identities by not being more vocal in acceptance. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because their request for the friends not to mention their sexuality might come across as dismissive of their identity, even if that's not their intention.\n"
