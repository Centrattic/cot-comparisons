However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them.

After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about someone not caring about gay pride and becoming uncomfortable when two gay friends mention their sexuality frequently. The author says they don't have a problem with being gay but find it annoying when it's brought up so often. They tried to hint at it, then explicitly told them, and were called homophobic. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's main issue is not with the people's sexuality but the frequency of them mentioning it. They claim they don't have a problem with being gay, just the constant references. They tried to communicate this subtly first, then directly, and faced backlash.\n\nNow, considering social norms and what's considered acceptable. People often have different comfort levels with how others discuss their identities. However, if someone is making it clear they find the mention of sexuality annoying, they might be overstepping by not respecting the other person's need to express their identity. On the other hand, the friends might be entitled to discuss their identity without being shamed.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"being accepting\" vs. \"being accommodating.\" Even if the author accepts the people for who they are, if their behavior (constantly mentioning their sexuality) affects the author's comfort, there's a conflict. But it's also important to consider that people might use their identity as part of their self-expression, especially if they feel it's important or if they've faced discrimination.\n\nThe author's approach to addressing the issue is another factor. They tried to hint and then directly communicate their feelings. However, if the friends felt called out or judged, the author might have contributed to the conflict by not handling it more sensitively. The friends' reactions (calling them homophobic) could be due to feeling that their identity is being minimized or criticized, even if the author didn't intend that.\n\nAlso, the author's initial statement of not supporting gay pride but accepting people could be seen as dismissive, even if they later clarify they don't have an issue. There's a difference between personal feelings and respecting others' need to advocate for their community.\n\nIn terms of social expectation, while it's true that people shouldn't be forced to engage in others' activism, there's also an expectation to respect others' identity expression. If the author is in a situation where they are part of a group that includes these friends, they might need to accept that part of their identity is being shared naturally in conversations.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's discomfort justifies their actions. If the friends are not being aggressive or pushy but just discussing their identity, the author's request might be about personal preference rather than something that's harmful. In that case, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friends' self-expression.\n\nBut the author's stance is that they're not against being gay but just don't want it to be mentioned so much. It's a gray area. The decision might hinge on whether the frequency of mentioning their sexuality was excessive and if the author's response was appropriate. If the friends were doing it in a way that's constant and intrusive, the author might have a point, but if it's just part of normal conversation, then the author's reaction could be seen as unnecessary.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be seen as a personal preference issue, but the friends' need to express their identity could be more fundamental. The author's attempt to address it directly might have been misinterpreted, leading to conflict. So, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
