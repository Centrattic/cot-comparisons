However, as I got to know them I soon began to dislike them. It seemed like they had to make it painfully obvious that they were gay. I felt like every other sentence they tried to squeeze in \"Being a gay woman.\" and various other things such as that. it made me very uncomfortable, I don't have an issue with gay people but I wouldn't go as far as to say as I support them. We're all human, if you're gay then you're gay. Just keep me out of it, is all I ask. After this continued for awhile I decided to try and subtly hint at them that they were mentioning they were gay far too frequently.  \n\n\n  \nWhen that didn't work, I resorted to telling them beliefs on the subject and I was quickly resented, being called homophobic and unaccepting of them. (Even though I /clearly/ said I do accept them for their sexuality. I would just appreciate it if they didn't annoyingly mention it ever few minutes!

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who met two gay people and started to dislike them because they kept mentioning their sexuality a lot. The person says they don't have an issue with gay people but don't support gay pride. They tried to hint that the constant mentions were annoying and then got called homophobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't opposed to being gay but finds the frequent reminders uncomfortable. They mention they accept them as people but don't support the cause. The friends responded negatively, calling them homophobic.\n\nNow, what's the problem here? The author is expressing discomfort with how often their friends bring up their sexuality, but the friends might see it as invalid to not support pride. The question is whether the author is wrong for not supporting gay pride and for finding the mentions annoying.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't directly discriminatory; they just don't care for the constant references. On the other, in many social contexts, especially in modern times, supporting the LGBTQ+ community isn't just about pride events but about allyship. The friends might feel that not supporting pride is a form of indifference or even tacit acceptance of stigma. \n\nAlso, the author says they don't have an issue with being gay, which is good, but not supporting the community's efforts can be seen as not being a full ally. The friends might feel that by not supporting pride, the author isn't respecting their identity. \n\nBut the main conflict here is the constant mentioning. Maybe the friends feel the need to assert their identity because they face discrimination, so bringing it up is part of their experience. The author's annoyance could be seen as dismissing their experiences. \n\nSo, the author's stance isn't necessarily hateful, but the problem is in the reaction to the friends and the lack of support for a cause that's important to them. The friends might feel that the author's position is not accepting enough, even if there's no direct prejudice. \n\nIn AITA terms, the author is likely in the wrong because their attitude, while not bigoted, could be seen as not supporting the community in meaningful ways and not respecting their friends' need to express their identity. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
