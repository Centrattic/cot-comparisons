I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who adjusted his behavior during his wife's pregnancy but now feels like she's still expecting those same changes post-birth.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband went along with some requests during pregnancy\u2014like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her control the TV. He found some of them ridiculous but complied. After the baby was born in October, he's trying to revert to their old ways, but the wife is still enforcing those changes. He feels this is insulting and is upset about the takeout expenses affecting the budget.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. Let's break it down. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to make adjustments to support the expectant parent, even if some requests are tough. But after birth, the husband is resuming his previous habits. The wife might still be adjusting to the new baby and ongoing changes in their lives. \n\nThe bathroom issue: The wife might still be sensitive to smells, especially with a newborn and possible postpartum fatigue. The husband's comment about the smell being insulting could be seen as dismissive. Maybe he's not considering that she might still be dealing with physical or emotional changes.\n\nThe TV control: Allowing her to have control during pregnancy was a gesture of support. Now, post-birth, maybe she's still dealing with stress or lack of time. The husband taking over the baby watch at home might mean she's not getting rest, so she uses the TV as a distraction. His frustration here might come from not understanding her current needs.\n\nFood issue: Takeout during pregnancy can be a temporary adjustment. Post-birth, it's a financial concern. The husband might be right about the budget, but how it's communicated matters. If he abruptly stops without discussing, it could be seen as a withdrawal of support. The wife might be struggling to recover or manage the new responsibilities, and takeout was a convenience she relied on.\n\nSo, the husband's perspective is about returning to normal and feeling that the changes were only temporary. The wife's perspective might be about ongoing needs, especially with a newborn. The question is whether he's in the wrong by not continuing to accommodate her. \n\nCultural norms and expectations play a role. Postpartum, women often need more support due to recovery, sleep deprivation, and caring for the baby. The husband might not be recognizing that her needs are still valid. Also, communication is key. If he just went back to old ways without talking to her, that could be the problem. It's about mutual understanding and adjusting together, not reverting unilaterally. \n\nThe husband's tone in the examples (like calling the smell \"insulting\") might come across as disrespectful. He should consider her feelings and the reason behind her requests rather than dismissing them. The wife might still need some accommodations, even postpartum, and this is a time for teamwork. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering his wife's ongoing needs and the shared responsibilities of parenting. He should communicate and find a middle ground instead of reverting to old habits.\n"
