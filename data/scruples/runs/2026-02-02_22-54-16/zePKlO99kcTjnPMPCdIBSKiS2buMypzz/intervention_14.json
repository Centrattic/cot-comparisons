Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who, after his wife gave birth, went back to their old habits, but she's still expecting him to follow the changes he made during her pregnancy. The husband feels like he was accommodating during pregnancy but now wants to revert to normal, and the wife is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The husband made a lot of sacrifices during pregnancy because he loved his wife and understood her discomfort. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to go back to how things were. But the wife is still expecting those accommodations, maybe because she's dealing with postpartum challenges or the stress of having a newborn. \n\nThe examples given are about the bathroom, TV control, and takeout food. The husband thinks using the upstairs bathroom is just normal now, and he's being insulted by her insisting he not use it. The wife might still be sensitive about smells postpartum. The TV thing is her wanting control during pregnancy, but now maybe she's still tired and wants to watch shows when she can. Food-wise, she's used to takeout, which might be easier for her to manage with the baby, but the husband feels it's a budget strain and wants to stop. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he was accommodating during pregnancy, which is a valid reason. The wife's expectations might be based on her current stress or postpartum needs. But the husband is trying to balance his own needs and the budget. However, after the baby is born, the situation changes. The wife might still have valid reasons for needing certain accommodations, like the smell issue which could be related to postpartum olfactory sensitivity. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel entitled to his old routines. But maybe he hasn't considered that his wife's needs are still high. The key here is communication. If they haven't talked about this transition period, both might be in the wrong for not adjusting expectations. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe husband did make an effort during pregnancy, which is commendable. Now, postpartum is a different phase. The wife might need some support, and expecting her to adjust might be hard. But the husband is also within his rights to want to return to his habits. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's trying to maintain his lifestyle, but there's a lack of communication. However, maybe he should be more empathetic. But the question is strictly about being in the wrong. The wife might have valid reasons, but the husband isn't necessarily wrong for not continuing all the changes. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
