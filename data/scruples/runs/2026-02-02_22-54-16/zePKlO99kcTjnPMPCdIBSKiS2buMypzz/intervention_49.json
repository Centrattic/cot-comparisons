Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that after the wife gave birth, the husband went back to their old ways, but she's still expecting the changes he made during her pregnancy. The husband feels that some of her requests were unreasonable, like not using the upstairs bathroom and taking over TV control and takeout. He's frustrated and thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience physical discomfort, like nausea, which can be triggered by smells. So when the wife asked not to use the upstairs bathroom, it might have been to avoid the smell of waste, which is a real issue during pregnancy. The husband complied during her pregnancy, which is thoughtful.\n\nAfter the baby is born, the wife is still expecting those accommodations. But maybe she's adjusting to her new role as a mother and is still dealing with postpartum recovery. The husband is trying to return to their normal routines, which is understandable, especially since the initial reasons for the changes (like pregnancy-related nausea) may no longer apply.\n\nThe husband is now feeling that the demands are unfair, especially since they're affecting the household budget. For example, the takeout issue. The wife might want the convenience, but the husband is concerned about finances and the extra work of taking care of the baby. \n\nI should also consider the balance between being considerate and setting boundaries. The husband made sacrifices during her pregnancy, which is commendable. However, after the baby is born, both partners need to adapt to new roles and responsibilities. The wife might need support, but the husband has his own needs and limitations.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong for wanting to revert to old habits? Not necessarily. He's trying to maintain a balance that works for both of them. However, communication is key here. If he just suddenly stops complying without discussing it, that could be an issue. The question is whether he's being unreasonable or if he's justified in expecting some changes to be temporary.\n\nThe examples he gives\u2014like the bathroom smell\u2014are practical. The smell is a real thing, but during pregnancy, the sensitivity might be heightened. After childbirth, the same smell might not affect her as much. So maybe the husband is right in thinking it's unreasonable to avoid the bathroom.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her needs are still valid, especially if she's dealing with postpartum challenges. There's a need for mutual understanding here. The husband might not be in the wrong, but he should approach the situation with empathy and communicate his needs as well.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to decide A or B. Based on the analysis, the husband's actions are understandable and not necessarily wrong, so the answer would be B.\n"
