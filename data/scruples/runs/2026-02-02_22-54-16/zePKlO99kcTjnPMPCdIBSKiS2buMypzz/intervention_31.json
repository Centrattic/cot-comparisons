Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author adjusting their behavior during their wife's pregnancy but reverting to old habits after she gave birth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the post. The husband mentions that during pregnancy, he accommodated his wife's requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom due to her sensitivity to smells. Now, postpartum, he's stopping those accommodations, which is causing tension. He also talks about control of the TV and takeout food. He feels these changes are necessary for his comfort and the budget, while the wife seems to still expect those accommodations.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. From the husband's perspective, he adjusted his behavior out of consideration during pregnancy, which is a common practice to support the pregnant partner. Now that the pregnancy is over, he's trying to return to normal. It's reasonable for him to feel that the restrictions are no longer necessary. However, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum changes, both physically and emotionally, and might need continued support.\n\nImportant factors here include communication. The husband might not have discussed these changes with his wife, leading to her feeling that her needs are being ignored. Postpartum is a transitional time, and the wife might be experiencing stress or adjustment issues. The husband's actions could be seen as abrupt if they're not communicated properly.\n\nBut from the husband's side, he's trying to balance his own needs and the household budget. The examples given (upstairs bathroom smell, TV control, takeout) are specific behaviors that he's adjusting. The question is whether it's reasonable to expect continued accommodation after the pregnancy period. Since the wife is now postpartum, some accommodations like avoiding certain smells might still be relevant if she's still sensitive, but others, like TV control, might be more about preferences.\n\nIt's also worth considering cultural or societal norms. In many relationships, partners make sacrifices during pregnancy, but it's expected that these can be renegotiated after birth. However, the transition period can be delicate. The husband might not be in the wrong if he's being respectful and communicating, but if he's dismissing his wife's ongoing needs without discussion, that could be the issue.\n\nIn this case, the husband states he's reverting to old ways but doesn't mention discussing this with his wife. That lack of communication could be a problem. However, the content of his examples (e.g., bathroom smell) might not be unreasonable to adjust if the wife is no longer pregnant. The key is whether the husband is being considerate and open to dialogue.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the answer leans towards the husband not being in the wrong, as he's attempting to return to a balanced life postpartum, but the situation could improve with better communication. The answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
