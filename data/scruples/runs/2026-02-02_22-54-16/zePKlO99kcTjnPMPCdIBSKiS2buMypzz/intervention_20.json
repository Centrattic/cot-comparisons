Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband made a lot of accommodations during his wife's pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now that the baby's born, he's going back to his old ways, but she's still expecting those changes. The husband feels like she's being unreasonable now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. During pregnancy, it's common for women to have specific needs, and partners often adjust to support them. The husband did that, which shows he was considerate. Now, postpartum, he's trying to return to his normal routine. But the wife is still holding onto those changes. Maybe she's still dealing with postpartum issues or the stress of caring for a newborn, so expecting him to continue some accommodations might be reasonable.\n\nBut the husband's perspective is that some of her requests were ridiculous and are affecting him, like the bathroom smell and the takeout budget. He feels like he's been accommodating enough during pregnancy and doesn't want to continue those same adjustments now. The question is whether he's in the wrong for going back to old ways.\n\nLooking at the examples: the bathroom issue. During pregnancy, avoiding the smell was a courtesy. Postpartum, he's thinking it's just normal to have bathroom smells and doesn't want to avoid it. But maybe the wife is still sensitive, especially if she's dealing with postpartum depression or anxiety. The TV thing\u2014letting her watch shows during pregnancy because she had limited mobility is understandable. Now, after giving birth, she might still need that as a way to relax, especially if she's busy with the baby. The takeout issue is about the budget; he's contributing to the household finances and wants her to adjust.\n\nThe key here is balance. Both partners need to adjust and communicate. The husband made sacrifices during pregnancy, and now he's trying to set boundaries. However, the wife might still need some support postpartum. It's possible that some accommodations are still necessary for her well-being. But the husband isn't wrong for wanting to reset some of the rules, especially if they were temporary during pregnancy.\n\nI think the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation. The husband is trying to reclaim his space and manage the household budget, which are valid points. However, he should also consider his wife's potential needs postpartum. It's a matter of communication and mutual understanding. Since the question is asking if he's in the wrong, and given that he's trying to return to his normal life after accommodating her during pregnancy, it's more likely that he's not in the wrong. However, he might need to approach the situation with empathy and talk to her about their needs.\n"
