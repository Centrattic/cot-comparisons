Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who adjusted his behavior during his wife's pregnancy, but now that the baby is born, he's trying to return to his old habits and is clashing with his wife over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience physical and emotional changes that can affect their comfort and preferences. The husband accommodating things like not using the upstairs bathroom or letting her watch TV might have been a way to support her during a tough time. Now, after giving birth, she's still expecting those same accommodations, but he feels it's unreasonable. \n\nBut wait, the wife just had a baby, which is a major life event. Postpartum can be a time when women are more vulnerable physically and emotionally. Maybe she's still dealing with recovery, stress, or even postpartum depression. The husband's arguments are about returning to \"normal,\" but the wife's perspective might be that her needs are still significant. For example, the bathroom issue could be about her sensitivity to smells due to her current state, not just about her stool. The takeout problem might be her relying on him because she's overwhelmed with the new baby. \n\nThe husband mentions that he's taking over baby duty, which is fair, but maybe his wife is still struggling with the transition to parenthood. The question is whether his actions are inconsiderate. If he's reverting to old habits without considering her ongoing needs, that could be problematic. The key here is communication. Did he talk to her about his feelings, or is he just acting out? The story doesn't mention that, but it's an important factor. \n\nAlso, the husband's tone seems a bit dismissive. Comments like \"her shit doesn't stink. Surprise, it does\" might come off as mocking her past requests. That could be hurtful, especially if she's still adjusting. The author's approach might be seen as not respecting her needs postpartum, which could strain their relationship. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife might need more support right now. The husband's willingness to adjust during pregnancy but not postpartum could be a point of contention. Maybe the wife feels that her ongoing challenges aren't being acknowledged. The financial aspect with takeout is a valid concern, but it's about finding a balance. \n\nSo, the husband isn't entirely in the wrong because he's trying to return to his previous comforts, but he might be missing the support his wife still needs. The answer depends on whether the wife's current needs are legitimate and if the husband is being considerate. Since the story is from the husband's perspective, it's possible he's not seeing things from her side. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being understanding of her postpartum situation.\n"
