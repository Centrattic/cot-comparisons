Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for reverting to old behaviors after his wife gave birth.\n\nFirst, the context: During pregnancy, the author made a lot of accommodations for his wife, even some that seemed excessive. After the baby was born, he's trying to go back to their old ways, but she's still expecting those accommodations. The examples given are using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout for food.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. When the author was accommodating during pregnancy, he did so because he understood it was part of her health and comfort. Now, postpartum, there's a shift in expectations. However, postpartum is a time when new parents, especially mothers, often need continued support. The wife might still be dealing with physical and emotional challenges from childbirth and adjusting to a newborn. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He's balancing work, baby care, and financial concerns. But reverting to old ways without considering his wife's current needs could be seen as dismissive of her postpartum experience. The wife might still be struggling with postpartum depression, physical recovery, or adjusting to motherhood, and the changes he made during pregnancy might have been necessary for her well-being.\n\nHowever, the author has valid points too. The accommodations during pregnancy were temporary, and expecting them to continue indefinitely might not be fair. There's a need for negotiation and compromise. The author might be overreacting by calling her bathroom habits \"insulting\" instead of discussing it calmly. Respectful communication is crucial here.\n\nIn terms of the food issue, the husband's budget concerns are valid, but supporting his wife's health and comfort is also important. Maybe they can find a middle ground, like planning meals together or finding cheaper takeout options.\n\nOverall, the author isn't entirely wrong, but he's not fully right either. The wife might need some of these accommodations postpartum, but there's room for adjustment. The key is open dialogue to understand each other's needs without resentment. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether his actions are considerate of her current situation. If he's dismissing her needs and not communicating, that's where he's in the wrong. But if he's trying to adjust but needs to be more empathetic, there's a nuance. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his perspective, but there's a need for mutual adjustment. However, the initial analysis might lean towards A if he's not considering her postpartum needs. Hmm. I need to check the standard for AITA. Typically, if someone is reverting to old ways without considering the other person's current circumstances, especially if they're vulnerable, that's seen as wrong. So maybe A.\n"
