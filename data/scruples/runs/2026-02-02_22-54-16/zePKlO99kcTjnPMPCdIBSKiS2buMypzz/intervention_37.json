Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a husband who gave in to his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even some that seemed ridiculous. After their daughter was born, he's going back to their old ways, but the wife still expects him to follow the same rules. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout. The husband feels these are unreasonable now, especially since they're affecting the budget and his comfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, the wife might have had specific needs due to her condition, like nausea from bathroom smells. The husband complied then, which shows he was considerate. Now, with the baby born, those needs might not be necessary anymore. The wife, however, is still expecting those accommodations. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for reverting to old habits. From a fairness perspective, during pregnancy, the husband adjusted his behavior to support her health and well-being. Postpartum, if those adjustments are no longer medically necessary, the husband's return to usual behavior isn't unreasonable. However, the wife might still be adjusting to motherhood and dealing with postpartum challenges, which could affect her sensitivity to smells or her desire for takeout.\n\nBut the key point is that the husband is trying to balance his own needs and the household budget. It's reasonable for him to want to resume his usual habits once the medical reason is gone. The wife's expectations might be out of habit or lingering postpartum issues, but the husband isn't obligated to continue accommodations that don't have a current medical basis.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. It's reasonable for him to expect a return to normalcy after pregnancy, especially if the wife's needs no longer require those changes. However, communication between the couple is important to address any ongoing issues the wife might have, perhaps due to postpartum challenges.\n"
