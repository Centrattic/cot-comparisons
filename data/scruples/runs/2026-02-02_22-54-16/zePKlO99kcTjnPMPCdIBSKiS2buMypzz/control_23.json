Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who went back to his old ways after his wife gave birth. He had made some concessions during her pregnancy, like avoiding the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now, after the baby is born, he's reverting to normal, but the wife is still expecting those changes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to accommodate the expecting parent's needs due to physical discomfort or emotional changes. The husband did that, which is understandable. Postpartum is also a time when the new parent might still be adjusting, both physically and emotionally. The wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery and the demands of caring for a newborn. \n\nThe husband's actions now are about reclaiming some aspects of their pre-pregnancy life, which makes sense. However, the key here is the wife's expectations. If she's still feeling unwell or the baby is causing her stress, she might not be in a position to adjust as easily. The examples given are about bathroom use, TV control, and takeout. These seem like practical issues where compromise is possible. \n\nThe husband's frustration is valid, especially regarding the budget and personal space. But the wife's perspective is also important. Postpartum recovery can be challenging, and she might be struggling with the new routine. The husband needs to communicate his feelings without dismissing hers. It's a balance between being considerate and setting boundaries. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. He's not being malicious; he's trying to return to normalcy. However, the wife might still need support. The husband should approach this with empathy, discussing the changes rather than just reverting. Maybe they can find middle ground. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong, but he could be handling it better. Since the options are A (yes) or B (no), the answer is B.\n"
