Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is that the husband made a lot of accommodations during his wife's pregnancy but is now reverting to old habits after the birth, which the wife is objecting to.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The husband says he gave in to many of her requests during pregnancy because he loved her and she was going through a tough time. Now, postpartum, he's trying to go back to normal, but she's still expecting those accommodations. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for food, which is affecting the budget.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if the husband's actions are reasonable. During pregnancy, it's common for women to experience nausea and other symptoms, so accommodating their needs is often seen as supportive. However, postpartum, the husband is trying to return to his previous habits. The wife might still be recovering and adjusting, so maybe she's used to the accommodations and expects them to continue for her comfort. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of mutual respect and communication. The husband might feel that his sacrifices during pregnancy were temporary and now they should adjust back. The issue could be that the wife hasn't adjusted her expectations post-birth. The husband's points about the bathroom smell being real and the financial burden of takeout are valid. However, the wife might need time to adjust physically and emotionally after childbirth. \n\nIt's possible that the husband isn't considering that some needs might still be relevant, like postpartum recovery, which can involve physical and emotional challenges. For example, not using a certain bathroom might be about her sensitivity post-delivery, not just during pregnancy. Also, controlling the TV could be her way of decompressing after caring for a newborn. The food situation\u2014while it's a budget concern\u2014might be about her needing to eat properly as a new parent.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband has a right to his own preferences and the budget. The key here is whether there's open communication. If he hasn't discussed these changes with her and just reverted, that could be the issue. Maybe a middle ground is needed, like setting boundaries while still being considerate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not considering her ongoing needs postpartum, maybe he is. But if he's communicating his side and trying to balance things, maybe not. The question is whether his actions are unreasonable given the circumstances. The answer might depend on whether the husband is being respectful and communicative. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer could be that he isn't in the wrong because he's adjusting after a period of significant accommodation, but the wife's expectations might be unreasonable. However, the husband might not have addressed these issues with her, leading to conflict. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But given the examples, the husband's points about practical matters (smell, budget) might mean he's not in the wrong. But considering postpartum recovery, maybe some accommodations are still needed. Hmm. I think the answer is B (No) because the husband isn't in the wrong for trying to revert to normal after pregnancy, but he should communicate better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The examples given (bathroom smell, TV, takeout) are about practicality, so maybe the answer is B.\n"
