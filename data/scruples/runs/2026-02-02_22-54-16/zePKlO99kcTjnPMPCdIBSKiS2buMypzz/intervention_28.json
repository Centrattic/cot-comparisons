Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who adjusted his behavior during his wife's pregnancy by accommodating her requests, even some he found ridiculous. Now, after the birth, he's going back to his old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes to continue. The examples given are not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The husband feels that during pregnancy, he was overly accommodating, and now that the baby is born, it's unreasonable to keep those changes. The wife, on the other hand, might still be dealing with postpartum issues, fatigue, or a desire for some control in her life after the stress of pregnancy and childbirth. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect, communication, and compromise in a relationship. The husband's actions during pregnancy were considerate, which is good. However, after the birth, not all accommodations might be necessary, but the wife might still need some support. The husband's frustration is understandable, especially with the financial strain from takeout. But he might need to consider that postpartum recovery can be tough, and she might need some comfort.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, going back to normal is reasonable, but if the wife is still struggling, insisting on certain accommodations could be necessary. The husband's approach should be to communicate openly with his wife about the changes and find a middle ground. For example, maybe not using the upstairs bathroom isn't necessary anymore, but he could explain that and see if she's okay with it. Similarly, with the TV and takeout, perhaps setting some boundaries while still showing support.\n\nThe husband's irritation with the smell of the bathroom and the cost of takeout is valid, but he should approach these issues with empathy. The wife might have valid reasons for wanting those things, even if they seem small. The answer likely depends on whether there's open communication and mutual understanding. If the husband is being dismissive of her needs now, that could be the problem. However, if he's trying to balance his own needs and the budget while being considerate, he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and whether there's a lack of communication. The husband's intent here seems to be about fairness and personal boundaries, not being inconsiderate. But he might not be considering that the wife's needs postpartum are still important for her well-being. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but he could be doing better in communicating and finding a compromise. Given the options, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because he's adjusting back to normal after a temporary period, but the situation requires more nuanced communication rather than a black-and-white answer.\n"
