Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reverting to old habits after his wife gave birth. The author explains that during her pregnancy, he gave in to many of her requests, even the ridiculous ones. Now, postpartum, he's trying to go back to normal, but she's still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom (due to smell), letting her control the TV, and taking out for takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to go out of their way to accommodate the pregnant person's needs, which can include physical discomforts like sensitivity to smells. The author complied with these requests, which is generally seen as supportive. Now, after birth, the wife is still expecting these accommodations. The author feels that these are no longer necessary and wants to return to pre-pregnancy norms. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a reasonable expectation to revert to old habits postpartum? Was the wife's request for continued changes unjustified? The author mentions that the smell from the upstairs bathroom is an issue, which is a valid concern. The TV control and takeout might be more about habits formed during pregnancy. However, after childbirth, the mother is likely dealing with recovery and baby care, which can be physically and emotionally taxing. She might need continued support, even if the initial reasons (like pregnancy-related nausea) have lessened.\n\nBut the author is also a new parent, dealing with the baby's needs. He might feel that the wife's continued demands are unfair, especially if they were temporary accommodations during pregnancy. The question is about whether the author is wrong for not wanting to continue these after the baby is born. \n\nCultural norms might play a role here. In many societies, there's an expectation that the mother's needs are prioritized postpartum because she's recovering and the baby is new. However, this can vary. The author's frustration is understandable if the accommodations are now seen as unnecessary. However, the wife might still feel the need for them for her own well-being. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have discussed these changes with his wife, leading to misunderstandings. He might be assuming that the accommodations are no longer needed, but his wife might feel she still requires them for her comfort or mental health. Without communication, both sides can feel wronged.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both perspectives have merit. The author is trying to balance his own needs and the household budget, which is reasonable. The wife, having become accustomed to certain comforts, might find it hard to adjust, especially if she's still dealing with postpartum challenges. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing the accommodations. If the accommodations were temporary during pregnancy and the wife's needs have changed, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the wife is still in need of those accommodations for her well-being, then the author might need to adjust again. Since the examples given (bathroom smell, TV, takeout) are more about daily life and not necessarily medical necessities, the author's stance could be seen as reasonable. But the wife's perspective might be that she needs those things for comfort, especially with the added stress of a new baby.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might depend on the specific context and communication between the couple. However, based solely on the information provided, the author's actions in wanting to return to a balanced household might be justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points, and the lack of communication might be the real issue.\n"
