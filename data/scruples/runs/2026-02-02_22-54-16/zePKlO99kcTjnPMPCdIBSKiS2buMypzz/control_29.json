Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife was pregnant and made several requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom and controlling the TV. The husband complied during pregnancy but now, after the baby was born, he's going back to his old habits. The wife still wants those changes in place, and he's frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, women often have physical discomforts and emotional needs. The husband gave into her requests, even the \"ridiculous\" ones, which shows he was being accommodating. That's a good sign. But after the birth, he's reverting, and the wife is upset. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. The husband might feel that after the pregnancy, those accommodations aren't necessary anymore. However, the wife could be dealing with postpartum issues or still feeling the need for those changes for her comfort or the baby's. Maybe the smell of the upstairs bathroom is a lingering issue, or she's sensitive after childbirth. \n\nAlso, the TV control and takeout example: during pregnancy, maybe the wife needed that as a form of stress relief, but postpartum, she might still rely on those habits to cope with the new responsibilities of parenthood. The husband's sudden return to old ways without discussing it might come off as dismissive of her needs, even if they were different during pregnancy.\n\nFinancial stress is another factor. The husband mentions that takeout is hurting the budget. That's a valid concern, but how he handles it matters. Instead of just stopping, maybe he should talk to her about it and find a compromise, like cooking more meals together or setting a budget for takeout. \n\nThe wife's insistence on the changes might be because she's adjusting to life with a newborn and finds comfort in those routines. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the responsibility of a relationship is to continue supporting each other through different life stages. \n\nSo, the husband's actions could be seen as a lack of empathy towards his wife's ongoing needs. Even if some of the requests were excessive during pregnancy, after childbirth, the wife might have legitimate reasons for maintaining them. The issue here is that he's not communicating and just assuming it's \"insulting,\" which might not be the case. He should approach it with understanding and discuss their needs and boundaries together. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering his wife's perspective post-birth and isn't engaging in open communication to address the changes. It's important in a marriage to adapt and continue supporting each other, even if the reasons for the changes have evolved.\n"
