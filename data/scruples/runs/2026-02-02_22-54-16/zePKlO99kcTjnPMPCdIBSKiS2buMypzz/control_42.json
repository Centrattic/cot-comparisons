      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether he's at fault for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. He mentions that during her pregnancy, he gave in to a lot of her requests, even the \"ridiculous\" ones. Now, after the baby was born in October, he's trying to return to their normal routine, but she's still expecting those changes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can be physically and emotionally challenging for the mother. The author complied with her requests during that time, which might have been necessary for her comfort and health. For example, avoiding using the upstairs bathroom might have been due to her sensitivity to smells, which is common during pregnancy. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to revert, but she's still holding onto those changes. \n\nThe example about the bathroom: he says the smell is a problem, but he just deals with it. Wait, but during pregnancy, maybe the smell was more than just a normal smell because of her nausea or something. After birth, maybe she's still sensitive? Or maybe she's not, and the author is now resenting that he's stuck with that rule. \n\nThe TV issue: he let her watch all the reality shows because she couldn't do much else during pregnancy. Now, after giving birth, she's still expecting that, but maybe she has more time or he expects a balance. However, new parents often have a lot to deal with, and maybe she's still adjusting to the baby. \n\nFood: He's running out for takeout, which is costing the budget. He's now taking over baby duty when he gets home, so he doesn't think he should also have to get her food. But maybe she's still recovering or dealing with the baby's schedule, making it hard for her to prepare meals. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unreasonable by not continuing the accommodations post-pregnancy. The wife might need some time to adjust, both physically and emotionally, after childbirth. Postpartum is a period where women often need support, similar to during pregnancy. The author might be withdrawing support that was necessary during a vulnerable time. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that some of the requests were unreasonable and that they should return to their normal ways. However, he gave in during pregnancy as a gesture of care and support. Now, if the wife is still expecting those same accommodations, maybe she hasn't adjusted to the new normal. But maybe some of those things were just temporary, and the author is right to expect a return. \n\nI need to consider the perspective of both partners. The author feels that he's being fair by not continuing to comply with requests that were only necessary during pregnancy. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the author isn't being supportive anymore. The line between reasonable accommodations and overstepping might be blurry here. \n\nAnother angle: societal expectations and cultural norms. In many cultures, expecting a partner to make sacrifices during pregnancy is common, but after giving birth, the expectation might shift. However, postpartum care is crucial, and the author's return to old ways might not account for his wife's ongoing needs. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, especially regarding the budget and personal habits. But if the wife is still dealing with postpartum issues, maybe the accommodations should continue for a while. The author might not be considering her current state, which could lead to the wife feeling unsupported. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author made those changes willingly and without complaint during pregnancy, it's reasonable to expect that he might be expected to continue them if his wife is still in a vulnerable state postpartum. However, if the wife is now healthy and the reasons for the changes no longer apply, the author might be justified in wanting to revert. \n\nThe problem is that the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author is questioning if he's at fault for going back to normal. The wife's insistence on maintaining the changes might be the issue here. If the author's actions are causing tension and the wife's needs are no longer as pressing (e.g., the smell isn't as bad postpartum), then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the wife is still experiencing issues (like postpartum recovery), the author might need to continue some accommodations. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the wife's needs are still valid postpartum. If the author is now seeing her as being unreasonable (like the smell being an insult), but perhaps she's still sensitive, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the author is simply trying to return to a balanced relationship, he might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut the examples given are specific. The bathroom smell: the author says \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink. Surprise, it does. I just deal with it.\" That's a bit rude. He's dismissing her previous sensitivity and now finding it insulting. That language might indicate a lack of respect, which could be where he's wrong. \n\nSimilarly, the food issue: if she's used to takeout, maybe she's not able to cook, or maybe she's exhausted. The author's frustration is about the budget, but if she's struggling, maybe he should consider other solutions rather than just refusing. \n\nThe TV thing: if she's still taking care of the baby and has limited time, maybe she still needs the TV as a way to relax. The author might be not considering her current situation. \n\nSo overall, the author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging his wife's ongoing needs postpartum and is dismissing her previous accommodations as ridiculous, which could lead to a lack of support during a critical time. His frustration is valid, but the way he's handling it might be causing more harm.\n"
