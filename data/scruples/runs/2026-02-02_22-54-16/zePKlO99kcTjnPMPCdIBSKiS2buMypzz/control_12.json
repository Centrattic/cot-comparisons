That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the A$$hole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a husband, adjusted his behavior during his wife's pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her control the TV. Now, after she gave birth, he's reverting to his old ways, but she's still expecting those changes. The examples given are about the bathroom smell, TV control, and takeout food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience heightened sensitivity to smells, nausea, and other discomforts. The husband made accommodations because he loves his wife and wanted to support her during that difficult time. That's understandable and shows consideration. Now, postpartum, the wife might still be dealing with physical and emotional changes. Maybe the smell of the bathroom is still bothering her, or she's more sensitive after childbirth. The husband's frustration is that he's trying to return to normal, but she's not. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband's actions are reasonable. He's not being inconsiderate during pregnancy, but after birth, he's stopping the accommodations. However, the wife might still need some adjustments postpartum. For example, postpartum depression or fatigue could make her less able to handle certain things. The bathroom issue: maybe the smell isn't just about the toilet but about the overall environment if she's recovering. The TV control: after having a newborn, she might need rest and watching TV could be her way to relax. The takeout: perhaps after childbirth, she's dealing with loss of appetite, or it's easier for her to get food quickly, and the husband's budget is now under strain.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's perspective is that these accommodations were temporary and tied to the pregnancy. Now that the baby is here, he's adjusted his routine to handle baby duties, and he feels the previous changes are no longer necessary. But maybe the wife hasn't recovered fully, or maybe some of the changes are still part of their new family dynamic. The husband not going out for takeout could be a budget concern, but he's also taking on more responsibilities with the baby, so perhaps sharing that load is important.\n\nI need to think about the fairness of both sides. The husband's initial adjustments were out of love and support. Now, expecting the wife to adjust to the new normal, especially if her pregnancy-related issues are resolved, might be reasonable. However, if the wife is still dealing with postpartum issues, the husband might need to continue some support. The question is whether the husband is wrong for stopping the accommodations that were specific to pregnancy. The bathroom smell example: if she could handle it during pregnancy but not after, maybe there's another reason. But the husband's point is that the smell was a problem during pregnancy, so why is it now offensive to him to say it's still a problem? Wait, the wife is insisting on the changes now, but maybe she still has valid reasons. The husband might be assuming that her reasons are gone, but if the wife is still experiencing issues, he's not considering her needs. \n\nSo the husband's mistake might be not communicating with his wife about why he's reverting, and perhaps not understanding that some needs might persist postpartum. The author might be in the wrong because he's dismissing his wife's current needs without considering that they might still be relevant. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the accommodations during pregnancy were temporary, but if the wife is still experiencing discomfort or needs support after giving birth, the husband should be empathetic and adjust accordingly. He should have a conversation to understand her perspective rather than just going back to old ways. The budget issue is a separate point, but he should approach it with understanding instead of just stopping the takeout without discussing it.\n"
