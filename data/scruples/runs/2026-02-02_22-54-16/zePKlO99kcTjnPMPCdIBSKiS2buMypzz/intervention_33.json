I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is that he's a husband who, during his wife's pregnancy, gave in to a lot of her requests, even if they were ridiculous. Now that their daughter was born, he's going back to their old ways, but she's still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout. He's upset because he feels like these things are unreasonable now and it's affecting the budget and his routine.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The husband says he did those things out of love and consideration during her pregnancy, which is a vulnerable time. Now, he's trying to return to their normal life. But the wife might still need some accommodations postpartum, especially since she's caring for a newborn. The question is whether he's wrong to stop following those requests now.\n\nFrom the husband's side, he's feeling that the requests are no longer necessary. For example, the bathroom smell\u2014maybe it's not just about the smell during pregnancy but maybe a lingering issue? Or maybe she's still sensitive? The TV control might be because she's dealing with the stress of a new baby and wants some downtime. As for food, maybe she's physically exhausted and needs quick meals, which takeout provides. The husband is concerned about the budget, but maybe the wife needs that support now.\n\nBut the wife hasn't been mentioned here, so we only have his perspective. He's saying she's \"insisting\" on the changes, which suggests she's not letting go. However, postpartum is a time when women might need more support. Maybe some of these accommodations aren't just for her comfort during pregnancy but also for recovery and caring for the baby. The husband might be underestimating the physical and emotional toll of postpartum.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is also dealing with his own responsibilities, like taking over baby watch. He might feel overburdened. The key here is balance. Are these requests reasonable? For instance, if the bathroom smell is a legitimate issue, maybe there's a solution. For the TV, maybe they can compromise. The takeout could be balanced with other meal options.\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong. The problem is that he's reverting to old ways without considering that some needs might still be valid. The wife's needs postpartum might be different. The husband's actions could be seen as insensitive if he dismisses her needs without discussion. However, if the requests were only during pregnancy and she's expecting them to continue unnecessarily, then maybe he's justified.\n\nBut postpartum depression or stress could be factors. Without knowing more, it's hard to say. The husband's intent is to return to normal, but maybe the wife still needs some support. The answer might depend on communication. If he hasn't discussed this with her and just stopped, that's a problem. If he has and she's unreasonable, then maybe not. But based solely on his account, he might be in the right because he's trying to establish a new norm. However, it's possible that some accommodations are still necessary. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that he should communicate better with his wife to find a middle ground.\n"
