Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that during his wife's pregnancy, he gave in to a lot of her requests, even the ridiculous ones. Now that she's had the baby, he's going back to their old ways, but she still expects those accommodations. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and buying takeout. The author feels like these things are unreasonable now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, hormonal changes and physical discomfort can make women more sensitive or have specific needs. The husband accommodated these, which is common and often a kind gesture to support his partner. However, after giving birth, the situation changes. The author is now trying to revert to their usual habits, which makes sense because the temporary adjustments were for pregnancy-related reasons.\n\nThe key point is whether the husband is in the wrong for not continuing those accommodations postpartum. From a fairness perspective, the temporary sacrifices during pregnancy were made out of love and support. Now that the baby is here, expecting those same adjustments might not be reasonable for the husband. The wife might still feel some postpartum sensitivity, but the original reason (pregnancy) is over. It's also about mutual respect and communication. The husband should express his feelings without being dismissive, but he's not wrong for wanting to return to their normal routine. Financial issues with takeout are practical concerns too. So overall, the husband isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
