I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband is returning to old habits after the birth of their daughter, and the wife is still expecting some of the accommodations they had during her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The husband claims he gave in to many of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even when they were ridiculous. After the baby was born, he started going back to normal, but the wife is still expecting those changes to continue. He gives examples like not using the upstairs bathroom, giving up the TV remote, and ordering takeout. He feels these things are unreasonable now and are affecting the budget.\n\nThe wife's side isn't directly stated, but from the husband's perspective, she's still insisting on the same changes. The husband feels it's insulting and unfair. The key points here are about expectations and boundaries post-pregnancy. \n\nI should consider if the husband had a reasonable expectation to return to his previous habits. During pregnancy, he made accommodations, which might have been necessary for her comfort and health. After childbirth, those accommodations might still be needed if she's recovering or dealing with postpartum issues. However, the husband feels the accommodations are no longer necessary and it's affecting him.\n\nIs the husband wrong for expecting things to go back to normal? Well, pregnancy can cause physical and emotional changes, and some habits might be necessary for her well-being postpartum. But the husband's arguments are that the things like bathroom smell and TV control are not justified anymore. The food issue is about budget, which is a valid concern.\n\nIt's a nuanced situation. The husband might be right in feeling that some of the accommodations were unnecessary, but he also needs to consider the postpartum period's challenges. However, the wife's needs might still be valid. The key is communication. If the husband didn't discuss these changes and just went back to old ways, that could be problematic. If he's dismissing her needs without understanding, he might be at fault. But if he's trying to balance his needs and the budget, maybe not. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The examples he gives\u2014like the bathroom smell\u2014are things that might have been temporary. The husband might be right to feel that the smell is normal, but the wife might still be sensitive. This is a common issue in relationships where expectations shift. The husband's frustration is understandable, but so is the wife's need for some adjustments. \n\nSince the answer is A or B, and the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't communicate his feelings and just reverted without considering his wife's ongoing needs, he's in the wrong. If he tried to communicate but the wife is being unreasonable, maybe not. The scenario doesn't mention communication attempts. \n\nIn many cases, postpartum, a woman's body is still recovering, and some accommodations might be needed. However, the husband's points about budget and fairness are valid. It's a balance. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively. But typically, in such advice columns, the emphasis is on mutual understanding and communication. If the husband went back without discussing it, he might be wrong. If the wife is being unreasonable, maybe not. \n\nGiven the information, maybe the husband isn't entirely wrong. He's trying to adjust back to normal after the pregnancy. But the wife might still need some support. However, the husband's examples seem like they could be resolved with compromise. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to adjust, but there's a middle ground. However, if he's being dismissive of her needs, then A. The husband's tone is a bit dismissive (\"her shit doesn\u2019t stink. Surprise, it does\"), which could indicate disrespect. That might make him at fault. \n\nSo considering the tone and the abrupt return to old ways without communication, the answer leans towards A. But if the wife's expectations are unreasonable, it's B. It's a tough call. Based on typical advice, the husband is expected to be more communicative and considerate. Since he's not, maybe A is correct. But I'm not 100% sure. The husband's frustration is real, but his approach might be the issue. I'll go with A.\n"
