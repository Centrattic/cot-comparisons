Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong. The situation is that during his wife's pregnancy, he made several accommodations for her, like not using the upstairs bathroom and giving her control of the TV. Now that she's had the baby, he's trying to return to their previous habits, but she's still expecting those changes. He's frustrated because he feels some of her requests were unreasonable, like the bathroom smell and the takeout expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience nausea, sensitivity to smells, and other physical changes. It's common for partners to make adjustments to support them. The husband did that, which is understandable and caring. However, after the birth, the dynamic might change. The wife might still be adjusting to postpartum life, dealing with the baby's needs, and possibly experiencing ongoing physical or emotional challenges.\n\nThe key points are whether the husband is being unreasonable by reverting to old habits. The bathroom issue: during pregnancy, avoiding strong smells was necessary, but post-birth, that's not the case. The husband feels it's unfair to still avoid that bathroom. The TV control and takeout are about routine and financial strain. He's taking over baby duties, so he's not expecting to also handle takeout. \n\nBut the wife might still be in a vulnerable state postpartum, dealing with the baby's care, possible sleep deprivation, and hormonal changes. The husband's frustration is valid, but he should consider her perspective. Maybe the wife is struggling with the transition back to normal life and still needs some adjustments. Communication is crucial here. Instead of seeing it as \"old ways,\" they need to establish a new normal together. The husband's actions might be seen as dismissive if he's not considering her ongoing needs. However, he's also justified in wanting to maintain his own needs, like not overspending on takeout. \n\nBalancing both perspectives is important. The husband isn't entirely wrong for wanting to adjust, but he might be missing the point that the situation has changed, and some accommodations are necessary for the wife's well-being now. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's adjusting his behavior based on changed circumstances, but there's a nuance that he should communicate better rather than just going back to old ways without discussion.\n"
