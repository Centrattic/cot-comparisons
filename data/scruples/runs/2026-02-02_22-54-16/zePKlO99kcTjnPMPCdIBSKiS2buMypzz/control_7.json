I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went back to their old ways after their wife gave birth, but she's still expecting the same accommodations they had during her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. During pregnancy, the author gave in to a lot of his wife's requests, even if some seemed ridiculous. After the baby was born, he stopped doing those things, but the wife is still expecting them. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and buying takeout. The author feels it's unreasonable now, especially with the financial strain.\n\nNow, considering the possible perspectives. The author might feel that during pregnancy, he made sacrifices for her comfort, which is common in relationships. After the birth, he expects things to return to normal. However, the wife might be struggling with postpartum challenges, and the changes she requested during pregnancy might still be important for her mental health or well-being. The bathroom issue could be related to her sensitivity to smells postpartum, and the takeout might be because she's dealing with a new baby and can't manage cooking.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about the budget and wants to resume his old habits. But maybe he's not considering that some of these accommodations are still necessary for her, especially if she's dealing with postpartum depression or exhaustion. The question is whether it's reasonable to continue these things after birth or if the author is right to revert.\n\nI should also think about societal expectations. It's common for partners to make adjustments during pregnancy, but after birth, the needs might change. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe he's not communicating effectively. Perhaps the wife expects ongoing support, and the author's sudden return to old habits is causing tension.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should communicate their needs. If the wife is still struggling and the author is cutting back on support, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the accommodations were only necessary during pregnancy and there's no medical reason to continue, the author might be justified in returning to normal.\n\nBut postpartum period can be tough, and some needs might persist. The author's dismissive tone (\"her shit doesn\u2019t stink. Surprise, it does\") might come off as rude, which could hurt his case. The wife's control of the TV might be her way of coping with the stress of caring for a newborn. The financial aspect is also a valid concern.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not considering his wife's ongoing needs postpartum, he might be. But if those accommodations were only for pregnancy and there's no ongoing medical necessity, he's not. The key is whether the wife's current requests are reasonable given the postpartum context. The author's tone and approach might be part of the problem, as he's treating her requests as ridiculous now, which could indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging that some of her needs are still valid postpartum. However, if those accommodations were only temporary, he's not. The answer might hinge on the specific circumstances and the nature of their relationship dynamics. But given the information provided, the author's dismissive attitude and the possible ongoing needs of the wife, he could be in the wrong.\n"
