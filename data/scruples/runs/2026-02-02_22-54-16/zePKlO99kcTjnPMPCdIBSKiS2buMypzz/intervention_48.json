I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is at fault for reverting to old habits after his wife gave birth.\n\nFirst, the situation: During his wife's pregnancy, he gave in to a lot of her requests, even if they seemed ridiculous. Now that she's had the baby, he's trying to go back to their old ways, but she's still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out for her. He feels she's overstepping now, and it's affecting the budget and his comfort.\n\nThe user thinks he's not in the wrong, but they want another opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, during pregnancy, many people make sacrifices because they know the pregnant person might be uncomfortable. The husband's actions during pregnancy could have been acts of kindness and support. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to return to normal, which is understandable. The wife's insistence on continuing those changes could be seen as unreasonable, especially if they're no longer necessary. For example, the smell of the bathroom isn't going away just because she was pregnant, so expecting him to avoid it postpartum might be unfair. Similarly, giving up the TV for months isn't something most people would do long-term, and food delivery being a financial burden is a practical issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be struggling with postpartum adjustments and feeling overwhelmed. The changes she requested during pregnancy might have been to manage her nausea or stress. Now, she could be relying on those same adjustments for emotional or physical comfort. There's also the aspect of communication. Did the husband talk to her about his concerns, or is he just reverting without discussing it? If they didn't communicate, that could be a problem. He might be dismissing her needs without understanding if they're still necessary for her recovery or mental health.\n\nAnother angle is the balance of compromise in a relationship. Marriage often requires mutual adjustments. If the husband is suddenly stopping all the accommodations without considering her feelings, it might hurt her. She might feel unsupported or like her needs are being ignored now that the baby is here. The key here is whether the changes are reasonable and still necessary. For example, the bathroom smell could be addressed with better ventilation instead of avoiding the bathroom. The TV control issue is more about shared space and respect, while the food issue is about financial and practical concerns.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he communicated his concerns respectfully and tried to find a middle ground, maybe not. But if he's just going back without any discussion, that could be a problem. However, the examples given seem like practical issues where compromise is possible. The husband's reasoning\u2014like the bathroom smell being real and the budget\u2014might be valid, but he needs to approach it with empathy. The wife might need support in other ways now that the baby is here, so the husband's return to old habits isn't inherently wrong, but the approach matters. Without communication, there's a risk of misunderstanding. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the changes during pregnancy were temporary, but it's nuanced.\n"
