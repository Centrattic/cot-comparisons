Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after returning to old habits post-birth. The situation is that during pregnancy, the husband gave in to many of his wife's requests, but now, after the baby was born, he's going back to the old ways, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband mentions he gave in to things like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and getting takeout. Now, he's reverting, and she's not happy. He feels like she's being unreasonable now that the pregnancy is over.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user wants a simple A or B answer. Let me consider from both sides. On one hand, during pregnancy, hormonal changes and physical discomfort can make certain things more sensitive. The husband was accommodating then, which is common to support the pregnant partner. But after birth, the wife expects those accommodations to continue? That might be the issue. However, postpartum can be a tough time for the mother too, with recovery and caring for the baby. Maybe she's relying on those habits as a way to cope or manage stress.\n\nThe husband feels that some things, like the bathroom smell, are just normal and she's being unreasonable. But maybe she's still sensitive postpartum. Also, the takeout thing affecting the budget could be a financial stressor. He's taking over baby duty, so expecting him to handle her food orders might add to his workload. However, balancing these needs is part of marital adjustment.\n\nFrom a fair perspective, both partners need to communicate and adjust. The husband might be right to set boundaries if some requests are unreasonable. However, the wife's expectations might stem from her own postpartum experience. It's possible that the husband is not in the wrong for reverting, especially if the accommodations were temporary and not necessary post-birth. But maybe he should have discussed his changes with her instead of just reverting. He might be dismissing her feelings, which could be the issue. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for partners to adjust during pregnancy, but postpartum needs can vary. The key is mutual respect and communication. If the husband didn't talk to her about his plans to revert and she's now upset, he might be at fault for not considering her perspective. However, if those accommodations were not needed anymore, he's justified. The answer depends on whether reverting without discussion is the problem or if the wife's expectations are unreasonable. Given the context, the husband's actions might not be entirely his fault, but he could have handled it better. The answer might be B (No), but there's nuance.\n"
