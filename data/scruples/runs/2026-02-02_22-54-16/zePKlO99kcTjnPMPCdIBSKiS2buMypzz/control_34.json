I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who went along with his wife's requests during her pregnancy, but after giving birth, he's going back to their old ways, and she's still expecting those changes to continue. He gives examples like not using the upstairs bathroom due to smell, letting her control the TV, and buying takeout which affects the budget.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to make accommodations because of the physical and emotional challenges the pregnant person faces. Morning sickness, nausea, and other symptoms can make certain things unbearable. The husband adjusted to these needs, which is generally seen as supportive.\n\nNow, postpartum, the wife is still expecting those same accommodations. The husband is pushing back, saying things like the bathroom smell is normal now, the TV control isn't necessary anymore, and the takeout is a financial strain. The key here is whether his actions are reasonable or if he's being inconsiderate.\n\nThe bathroom issue: During pregnancy, the wife's sensitivity to smells (like bathroom odors) might have been due to heightened sense of smell or nausea. After birth, that sensitivity might decrease, but maybe not entirely. The husband is now choosing to use the upstairs bathroom again, but the wife might still find it uncomfortable. The question is if it's unreasonable to expect him to continue avoiding it if she still feels that way. It's a small request, but if it's not causing harm, maybe the husband should consider her feelings.\n\nTV control: During pregnancy, she had control because she was restricted in activities. Postpartum, she might still be recovering and dealing with baby responsibilities. Taking the TV control away could be a way to relieve her stress. The husband might feel it's his turn, but the wife's need for some personal time (even if it's watching reality TV) could be important for her mental health.\n\nFood and budget: The wife has become used to takeout, which is a habit formed during a time when she might have had less energy. The husband is concerned about the budget. It's a practical issue. If the takeout is now unnecessary and straining finances, it's reasonable to want to adjust. However, communicating this and finding a compromise is important instead of just stopping it abruptly.\n\nOverall, the husband's actions are about returning to previous norms, but the wife's expectations might stem from her new role and stress. The question is about mutual consideration. The husband isn't wrong in wanting to adjust to a new normal, but he might not be approaching it with enough empathy. The wife might feel entitled to some of those accommodations during her adjustment period. The key is communication and compromise. If the husband just goes back without discussing it, he might be inconsiderate. However, the original question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be that he's not entirely in the wrong, but his approach could be improved. But according to the given options, the answer is A or B. Considering AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the community often looks at the balance of consideration. The husband made accommodations during pregnancy, which is good. Now, expecting to return to normal is understandable, but if the wife is still struggling, he should be more flexible. The examples given don't show extreme harm, but the wife's perspective is important. The husband might be in the right in wanting to adjust, but the way he's handling it (e.g., calling her stool smell \"insulting\") could be harsh. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, given the examples, the husband's actions are returning to normal, which is reasonable. The wife might need to adjust too, but the husband isn't wrong for wanting to. So the answer is B.\n"
