Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is after the wife gave birth, the husband is going back to old ways but the wife is still expecting the changes he made during her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband made accommodations during pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her have control of the TV, and getting takeout. Now, post-birth, he's reverting, and the wife is upset. The husband feels it's unreasonable now, especially since she's not pregnant anymore. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's break down the arguments. The husband's actions during pregnancy were accommodating, which is common and considerate. Post-birth, he's adjusting back to normal because the circumstances (pregnancy symptoms) have changed. The wife, however, is still expecting those accommodations, possibly due to postpartum needs or habits formed during pregnancy.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband isn't obligated to continue the same level of accommodation once the original reason (pregnancy) is over. However, the wife might be struggling with postpartum adjustments, which can be physically and emotionally taxing. Maybe she's not realizing that her needs are still valid, just in a different form now. \n\nThe husband's examples: the bathroom issue is a bit sensitive. It's true that bathrooms can smell, but during pregnancy, nausea was the main concern. Post-birth, the smell is just part of life. As for TV control, giving up control is a small concession. Food delivery affecting the budget is a practical concern. The husband is right to address financial issues, but maybe there's a middle ground.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong for not continuing the accommodations. If the wife's expectations are unreasonable now that the pregnancy is over, then he's not wrong to revert. However, if the wife is still dealing with postpartum challenges that require some flexibility, then the husband might need to adjust in other ways, not necessarily the same as during pregnancy.\n\nI think the key here is the change in circumstances. The husband isn't in the wrong for not maintaining the same level of accommodation post-birth, but there's room for communication. The answer is B (No), because the husband isn't wrong to adjust back to their normal routine after the pregnancy, especially when the original reasons no longer apply. The wife might need to adjust her expectations now, but that doesn't make him wrong for doing so.\n"
