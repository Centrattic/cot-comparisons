I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author says they gave in to their wife's requests during her pregnancy, even if some were ridiculous. Now that their daughter was born, the wife is still expecting those changes, but the author is trying to go back to normal. They mention specific examples: not using the upstairs bathroom because of smell, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout. The author finds the bathroom rule unfair now, the TV control is an issue, and the takeout is hurting the budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, hormonal changes and physical discomfort can make certain things more sensitive. The author complied out of consideration. After birth, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum changes, both physically and emotionally. It's possible she's struggling with the transition back to normal routines, especially with a newborn.\n\nThe bathroom issue: The author stopped using the upstairs bathroom because the wife found the smell offensive. Now, postpartum, maybe the wife is still sensitive to smells due to lingering hormonal effects or stress. The author finds it insulting, but the smell is a real issue. However, the author is now choosing to deal with it, which is reasonable. They might need to find a compromise, like using air fresheners or cleaning more.\n\nTV control and takeout: During pregnancy, the author let the wife watch whatever she wanted, which is a common accommodation. Post-birth, maybe the wife is still adjusting to the new routine and hasn't regained her usual energy. The author is now frustrated because the takeout is a financial strain. It's important to communicate about budgeting and perhaps find a middle ground, like cooking meals together or planning ahead.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're trying to revert to their previous habits, which is understandable. However, the wife might be struggling with the transition. The key here is communication. If the author is approaching this with empathy and discussing the changes rather than just reverting suddenly, they might be in the right. But if they're being dismissive of her needs, that's a problem.\n\nThe examples given don't show outright disrespect, but they do show a shift without considering the wife's possible ongoing challenges. It's a balancing act between respecting each other's needs. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to return to normal, but they should consider the wife's perspective and work together to adjust gradually.\n"
