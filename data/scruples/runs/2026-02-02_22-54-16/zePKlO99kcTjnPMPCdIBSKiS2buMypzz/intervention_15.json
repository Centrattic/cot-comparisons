Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reverting to old habits after his wife gave birth. He had made a lot of sacrifices during her pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom because she thought the smell was bad and letting her control the TV. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to go back to normal, but she's still expecting him to follow the same rules.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, he gave in to her requests, which he found ridiculous but did anyway. Now, after birth, he's trying to assert his old habits. The key here is that pregnancy can be physically and emotionally challenging, so people often make temporary adjustments for the well-being of the mother and baby. But after giving birth, those adjustments might not be necessary anymore, right?\n\nHe mentions specific examples: the bathroom, TV control, and takeout. The bathroom issue now seems to him like she's being unreasonable because \"her shit does stink,\" but maybe during pregnancy, her sensitivity was real and necessary. Now, after birth, her body is recovering, and maybe she's still sensitive to smells? Or maybe she's just used to the convenience. But he feels it's insulting. \n\nTV control is another point. During pregnancy, he let her watch reality shows because she couldn't do much else. Now, with a newborn, he's handling baby duty, and she might want to relax in the same way. But he's taking over the baby, so maybe he's overextending himself? Also, the takeout issue: she's used to him getting food for her, which is affecting the budget. He's trying to cut back but maybe hasn't communicated this effectively.\n\nThe author's perspective is that he's being unreasonable now. But maybe the wife is still adjusting postpartum, both physically and emotionally. Postpartum can be a time of stress, and she might expect some continuity in the adjustments made during pregnancy. The author might be acting out of frustration, but maybe he should communicate better instead of just reverting.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, the original adjustments were made for her comfort during pregnancy, which is a temporary state. After birth, those adjustments might not be necessary anymore. However, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, so it's possible that some accommodations are still needed. But the bathroom smell issue seems like an unreasonable expectation if it's just about the smell. The TV control and takeout are more about convenience and habits. \n\nHe might be justified in wanting to return to old ways, but maybe he's not considering her perspective. If he's just abruptly stopping the adjustments without discussing it, that could be where the problem lies. The key is communication. If he's not talking to her about his feelings and the budget, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if he's trying to communicate and she's still being unreasonable, then maybe he's not. The story doesn't specify if he's had those conversations. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation. Since he's trying to return to normal after the temporary adjustments of pregnancy, it's reasonable. However, the way he's handling it (e.g., thinking her shit stinks) might be dismissive, but the core issue is about reverting to old habits, which is understandable. The real problem might be the lack of communication rather than the actions themselves.\n"
