I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he gave in to many of her requests, even the ridiculous ones. Now, after the baby was born, he's reverting to their previous habits, but the wife is still expecting those changes to continue. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can be physically and emotionally challenging, so it's common for partners to adjust their behavior to accommodate the pregnant person's needs. The author stopped using the upstairs bathroom because the wife was sensitive to smells. That's a reasonable accommodation during pregnancy. However, after the baby's birth, the author feels it's no longer necessary and finds it insulting to continue. \n\nThe example about the bathroom usage: The wife's request was based on her physical condition during pregnancy. Once the baby is born, that specific need might not persist. So, the author resuming his normal bathroom use isn't unreasonable. \n\nThen there's the TV control issue. Allowing the wife to watch her shows during pregnancy makes sense as a way to support her. But now that the baby is born, the author might feel it's time to share that control again. It's a matter of balance. The wife might still be adjusting postpartum, so communication is key here.\n\nFood is another point. The author ran out for takeout during pregnancy, which was likely to keep the wife comfortable. Postpartum, with financial concerns, he wants to stop doing that. It's understandable, especially if the budget is tight. The wife might feel that the adjustments were part of marital support, but the author is trying to manage household logistics.\n\nI should also consider societal norms and expectations. Supporting a partner during pregnancy is often seen as a positive, but after the birth, partners need to readjust. The author isn't being cruel; he's trying to return to a balanced relationship. However, it's possible the wife still needs some level of support postpartum, which might be why she's insisting on the changes.\n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing his feelings of being taken advantage of, especially with the examples given. The bathroom issue is about a temporary accommodation that's no longer necessary. The TV and food examples are about habits that were formed during pregnancy, which the author now wants to change. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not being unreasonable. The wife might need some adjustments postpartum, but the author's perspective is that the initial accommodations were temporary and not meant to be permanent. The fact that he took over baby watch duties shows he's contributing in other ways. \n\nHowever, there's a potential for misunderstanding here. The wife might feel that the author is being dismissive of her needs now, especially if she's still dealing with postpartum challenges. But the author's examples don't indicate any current health issues for the wife\u2014just habits formed during pregnancy. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's adjusting back to a normal routine after a temporary period of accommodating his wife's pregnancy needs. The wife might need to adjust her expectations postpartum, but the author's actions are reasonable given the context. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
