I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.

I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after going back to old habits after his wife gave birth.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband says he gave in to a lot of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even some he thought were ridiculous. Now after the baby was born, he's reverting to the old ways, but she's still expecting those changes to continue. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, giving her control of the TV, and buying takeout for her.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to accommodate physical and emotional needs. But after the baby is born, the dynamics might shift. The husband feels that some of the accommodations aren't necessary anymore, especially when it comes to the bathroom smell and takeout costs. He's trying to readjust to the new normal.\n\nBut the wife is still expecting those changes, which might be because she's dealing with postpartum recovery and the challenges of a new baby. Her needing control of the TV or takeout might be a way to cope with stress or exhaustion. The husband's frustration is valid, especially with the financial aspect and wanting to resume normal routines. However, dismissing her needs as \"insulting\" could be seen as insensitive, even if he's trying to reassert balance.\n\nIt's important to consider both perspectives. The husband's right to set boundaries is important, but so is the wife's need for support during a vulnerable time. The key issue here is whether reverting to old ways without considering her ongoing needs is dismissive of her postpartum experience. The husband might not be in the wrong if he's trying to find a middle ground, but if he's ignoring her valid needs, he might be. However, the post doesn't mention if he's communicated this or discussed compromises. The answer hinges on mutual understanding and whether he's respecting her current needs while addressing his own. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might depend on the balance between their needs. If he's being reasonable and not cruel, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's being dismissive, then he might be. Given the examples, he's expressing frustration but not outright cruelty. So maybe B (he's not in the wrong) is the answer, but with the caveat that communication is key. However, the initial question is a yes/no for the AITA framework. In typical AITA, if both sides have valid points but the husband isn't being unreasonable, the answer might be B. But if the wife's needs are still valid postpartum, then maybe A. Hmm. I think the answer is B because he's trying to adjust back, and the wife should also be open to finding a new balance. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, he might be in the wrong for not considering her ongoing needs. Wait, the bathroom issue: he says the smell is normal, but maybe she's still sensitive postpartum. The TV and takeout could be about her needing some normalcy. The husband's frustration with the budget is valid, but he might need to communicate better. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but the situation needs discussion. So the answer is B.\n"
