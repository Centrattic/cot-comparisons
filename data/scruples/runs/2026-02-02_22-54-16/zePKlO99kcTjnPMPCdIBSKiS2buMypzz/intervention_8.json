Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during her pregnancy, he made several accommodations, even some he found ridiculous, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now, after the birth, he's reverting to their old habits but she's still expecting those changes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of pregnancy and postpartum. During pregnancy, women often experience physical discomforts, like nausea or sensitivity to smells, which can be severe. The author's compliance during that time was probably a way to support her, even if some requests seemed trivial. Now, with the baby born, those specific needs might have changed. The wife might still need some adjustments for postpartum recovery, but the author is pushing back because he feels the old accommodations are no longer necessary.\n\nThe key points are whether the author's actions are reasonable. Allowing the wife to use the upstairs bathroom now, instead of avoiding it due to smell, seems practical. Similarly, controlling the TV and takeout might have been more about her comfort during pregnancy, but postpartum, the author wants to return to normalcy. However, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum challenges, so expecting some flexibility is understandable.\n\nBut the author is also dealing with the stress of caring for a newborn and managing the household. It's a balance. The author isn't being cruel; he's trying to return to how things were. The question is whether his behavior is inconsiderate. The wife's continued insistence might be due to lingering physical or emotional needs, which the author isn't acknowledging now that the baby is here.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't wrong to want to revert to old habits if the reasons for the changes no longer apply. However, communication is key here. Both partners need to discuss their needs and compromises. The author isn't being malicious, just perhaps not considering that some adjustments might still be necessary for his wife's recovery. But overall, his actions don't seem unjustifiable. So, the answer would be B.\n"
