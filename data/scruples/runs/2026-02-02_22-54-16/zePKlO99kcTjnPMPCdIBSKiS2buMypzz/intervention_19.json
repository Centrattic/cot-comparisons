Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who went back to his usual habits after his wife gave birth, but she's still expecting him to follow the changes he made during her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband made accommodations during her pregnancy because she was unwell. Now that the baby's born, he's reverting to old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and getting takeout. The husband feels these are unreasonable now, especially with the financial strain.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. The husband's actions were based on the temporary situation of pregnancy. Once that's over, it's reasonable for him to expect adjustments. However, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum challenges and might appreciate the continued support. \n\nBut the husband's reasoning is that the accommodations were temporary. The bathroom issue, for instance, was due to her nausea. Now, it's not fair to expect him to avoid the bathroom just because she doesn't like the smell. The takeout is affecting the budget, which is a valid concern. The husband is trying to balance his own needs and the family's financial health.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the changes were necessary for her comfort, especially during the stressful postpartum period. There's a potential for misunderstanding here. The husband might not be considering how reverting could affect her emotionally or physically, even if the reasons (like smell) are less urgent now.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and common expectations. In many relationships, partners make temporary adjustments during pregnancy. After birth, those adjustments are typically re-evaluated. However, postpartum is a time when women might need more support, so sudden changes in behavior could be stressful for the wife.\n\nThe husband's frustration is understandable, especially if these changes are impacting his daily life and finances. But maybe he should communicate better with his wife about the reasons for reverting. The wife might not realize the financial impact or that the smell isn't a health issue anymore. Alternatively, there might be other, more effective ways to address the smells without restricting bathroom use.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to return to normal, but he might need to approach the situation with more empathy and find compromises. Similarly, the wife might need to acknowledge that the temporary changes aren't necessary anymore unless there's a new reason for them.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The temporary adjustments made during pregnancy were appropriate, and expecting them to continue indefinitely without discussion is perhaps unreasonable. The husband is seeking to balance his own needs and the family's well-being, which is a valid stance. However, better communication could help both sides understand each other's perspectives more fully.\n"
