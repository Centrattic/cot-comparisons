Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going back to old habits after his wife gave birth. He mentions he gave in to many of her requests during pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and her controlling the TV and takeout. Now, post-birth, he's reverting, and she's still expecting those changes.\n\nHmm, first, pregnancy can be tough physically and emotionally. The author adjusted during that time out of love and support, which is commendable. But after birth, things might not go back to normal immediately for the mother. Postpartum is a time when women often need more support, not less. The examples given: the bathroom issue. During pregnancy, maybe she was sensitive to smells, but after birth, she might still be dealing with postpartum recovery. The smell might not be as bad to him, but it could be a trigger for her. Similarly, controlling the TV might be her way of coping with stress or fatigue. As for food, maybe she's dealing with postpartum depression or anxiety, making her rely on takeout because she's overwhelmed.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author might feel entitled to his old ways, but the wife might be struggling and still need those accommodations. The author's frustration is valid, but expecting her to drop those needs post-birth without discussion could be harsh. It's possible he's right to want to reset some things, but he should approach it with empathy and talk to her about the changes rather than just reverting. The answer might not be a clear-cut A or B. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's dismissing her ongoing needs without understanding, that could be the issue. Maybe he's not wrong entirely, but his approach could be problematic. The community often looks at these factors, so perhaps the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but there's room for dialogue. Wait, but if he's being insensitive to her postpartum state, then maybe he is. This is a bit tricky. I think the community often sides with the person adjusting post-pregnancy, but if the husband is being inconsiderate, he's wrong. The examples given are about daily things, but the wife's well-being is also important. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong for not considering her ongoing needs. But I'm not sure. Let me check similar cases. In AITA threads, when someone reverts without considering the other's continued needs, especially postpartum, they often get called out. So maybe A is the answer. But the husband's side is understandable too. Hmm. The key is balance. If he's being reasonable and communicating, maybe not wrong. But the way he's phrased it, like \"insulting\" and \"hurts the budget,\" might indicate he's not being empathetic. So leaning towards A.\n"
