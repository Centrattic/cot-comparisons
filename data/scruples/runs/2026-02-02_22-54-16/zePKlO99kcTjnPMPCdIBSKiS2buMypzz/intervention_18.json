I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let me read the situation again. The author is a husband who, during his wife's pregnancy, gave in to her requests even if they were ridiculous. Now, after the birth of their daughter, he's trying to go back to their old ways, but she's still enforcing those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out money for takeout.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. From the husband's perspective, he was accommodating during pregnancy, which is common for partners to do. However, after the baby was born, he feels that some of those accommodations aren't necessary anymore. The key here is whether the wife's continued demands post-pregnancy are reasonable or if the husband is justified in wanting to revert to their previous habits.\n\nFor the bathroom issue: During pregnancy, some women have heightened sensitivity to smells. The husband complied then, which was considerate. Now, he's being asked to still avoid the upstairs bathroom, even though the smell is normal. It might be unreasonable for the wife to still expect that, especially if she's not pregnant anymore. But maybe she's still sensitive or the baby's presence has made her more so? The husband says it's insulting, implying it's unnecessary.\n\nTV control: During pregnancy, he let her watch whatever. Now, post-birth, maybe she's still stuck on that. The husband wants to take over the TV when he gets home. It's about shared household responsibilities and mutual respect. If she's insisting on control without considering his needs, that could be an issue. But if the baby is the focus now, maybe her needs are different.\n\nTakeout: He's running out for her, which is costing money. Postpartum, she might need comfort food or have less energy. But the husband is concerned about the budget. There's a balance between supporting her and managing finances. If she's still in need of takeout, maybe she should be understanding of the budget, but if he's been doing it for months, it's reasonable for him to want to stop.\n\nThe author's actions are about returning to normal after accommodating during pregnancy. The wife, on the other hand, might be struggling with postpartum emotions or adjusting to caring for the baby. If she's still in a vulnerable state, her demands might be a result of that. However, if the husband is trying to balance his needs and the household, he's not entirely wrong.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the wife's continued demands are unreasonable. The husband is within his rights to expect some compromise. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
