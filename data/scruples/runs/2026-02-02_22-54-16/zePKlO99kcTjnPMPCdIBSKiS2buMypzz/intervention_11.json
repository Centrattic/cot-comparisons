That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who changed his behavior during his wife's pregnancy but is now going back to his old ways after she gave birth. The wife is still expecting those changes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband says he gave in to many of his wife's requests during pregnancy because he loved her and she was going through a tough time. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to return to normal, but she's still expecting the same things. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her have control of the TV, and taking out orders.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me break this down. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to make accommodations because of the physical and emotional challenges. But after birth, the dynamics can change. The husband might feel that some of these accommodations are no longer necessary, especially if they were based on temporary conditions like pregnancy-related nausea.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The husband's actions might be seen as reasonable, especially if the accommodations were temporary. However, the wife might feel that some of these changes are still important for recovery or adjusting to motherhood. For example, maybe the bathroom issue isn't just about smell but about her postpartum recovery. The TV control and food might relate to her needing rest and time to adjust.\n\nBut the husband's frustration is valid too. He's taking care of the baby and might be overextended. The financial strain from takeout is a practical concern. The question is whether his actions are dismissive of his wife's needs or if he's just adjusting back to normal.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. However, the husband's intention seems to be about restoring balance after a period of adjustment. The wife, on the other hand, might still need support. The problem might stem from a lack of communication. If the husband didn't explain his feelings or listen to her perspective, that could be an issue. But based on the post alone, the husband is expressing his own feelings and the impact on his life, which is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's trying to balance his own needs and the practical aspects of their new life with the baby. The wife's expectations might need to be reassessed, but the husband's actions are a response to his situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
