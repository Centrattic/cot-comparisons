That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who made a lot of concessions during his wife's pregnancy but is now trying to go back to normal after the baby was born. The wife is still expecting those changes to continue, and he's upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to make adjustments to support their spouse's health and comfort. The husband mentions things like avoiding the upstairs bathroom due to smells and letting his wife watch TV. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to revert to their old ways, but the wife is still holding onto those rules. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if his actions are justified. The key here is whether the changes made during pregnancy were necessary for her well-being. The husband says some requests were \"ridiculous,\" but he complied. Now, he's frustrated because the rules are still in place even after the pregnancy period.\n\nHowever, postpartum is a time when women might still need support. The wife might be dealing with recovery, new responsibilities, and hormonal changes. Maybe she's not realizing that the husband is trying to balance his role as a partner and a new parent. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the wife's continued insistence might be from lingering needs or stress.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks B. I need to consider if the husband is overstepping by not acknowledging that some changes might still be needed. For example, if the bathroom issue was due to pregnancy-related nausea, maybe it's still causing her discomfort. Or perhaps the takeout is part of her postpartum adjustment, and she's not yet back to regular eating habits.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband has a right to his own comfort and the financial responsibility of the household. The takeout affecting the budget is a valid concern. It's a balance between respecting past accommodations and addressing current needs.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation is complex. The husband isn't entirely wrong for wanting to revert to old ways, but the wife's continued expectations might stem from valid postpartum issues. The answer hinges on whether the husband is dismissing his wife's ongoing needs. Since the question is about the husband's wrongdoing, if he's not acknowledging her continued needs, maybe he's partly at fault. But if he's just asserting his own boundaries after the initial period, it's more balanced. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with a need for communication and compromise. However, the husband's frustration is valid, but so is the wife's potential adjustment period. I think the answer is B, but with the caveat that both need to communicate better. So the answer is B.\n"
