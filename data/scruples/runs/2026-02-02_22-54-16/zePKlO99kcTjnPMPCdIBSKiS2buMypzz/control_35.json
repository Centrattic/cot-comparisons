I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that during his wife's pregnancy, he gave in to many of her requests, even some he thought were ridiculous. Now, after the baby was born, he's reverting to their old habits, but the wife still expects him to follow those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for food.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. So, from a relationship perspective, during pregnancy, it's common for partners to make concessions because the pregnant person is dealing with physical discomforts. The author did that, which is understandable. Now, after the baby is born, the wife still expects those changes. The author feels like the restrictions are unnecessary now, like the bathroom smell. He's trying to return to normal but the wife is upset.\n\nIs the author wrong for not continuing to comply with what he sees as unreasonable requests? Well, it's important to consider mutual respect and communication. The author might feel that his needs are being overlooked, especially with the financial strain from takeout. However, the wife might still need some adjustments postpartum, both physically and emotionally. Maybe she's adjusting to new responsibilities and expects some support.\n\nBut the bathroom example: it's a bit odd. The smell is a natural bodily function, but during pregnancy, some women are more sensitive. Postpartum, maybe she's still dealing with recovery. However, the author's point is that the smell is normal and he's tired of accommodating something he sees as trivial. \n\nThe TV control issue: maybe she needs the distraction or relaxation after being in the hospital. Now, with a newborn, she's exhausted and controls the TV to unwind. The author might feel that it's an old habit that's no longer necessary.\n\nThe takeout issue: financially, it's a strain. The author is right to be concerned about the budget, but the wife might be dealing with postpartum fatigue and find it hard to go out or cook. Maybe she expects him to continue helping because she's still adjusting.\n\nSo, the question is about balancing mutual needs. The author is trying to return to old ways, which the wife is resisting. Is he wrong? Well, if the wife's requests are reasonable, maybe she's just adjusting. But the author's perspective is that some of these were unreasonable even during pregnancy. However, postpartum is a time when support is crucial. The author might be missing that the wife is still in a vulnerable period, even though the pregnancy ended.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to his own comfort and the financial concerns. It's a balance. If he's trying to communicate his needs, but the wife is still expecting the same accommodations, there's a conflict. The key here is communication. The author should talk to his wife about his feelings and find a middle ground. But is he in the wrong? If he's not respecting her needs postpartum, maybe. But if the requests were unreasonable, perhaps not. \n\nThe examples given (bathroom smell, TV control, takeout) are things that might be seen as more about his wife's preferences during a time she needed support. Now, postpartum, she might still need some of these for her mental health. The author's frustration is valid, but he should approach it with empathy. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's reverting without considering her ongoing needs, maybe he is. Alternatively, if the requests were always unreasonable, maybe not. The answer might be A (yes) because he's not considering her ongoing needs postpartum. But I'm not sure. It's a nuanced situation. Maybe the answer is B (no) because he's within his rights to want to return to normal, but should communicate better. But I think in terms of the AITA framework, people often criticize the partner who reverts without considering the other's postpartum needs. So perhaps A is the answer.\n"
