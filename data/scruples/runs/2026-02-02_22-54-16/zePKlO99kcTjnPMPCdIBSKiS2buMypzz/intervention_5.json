Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author went back to their old habits after their wife gave birth, which she's now upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The husband says he gave in to his wife's requests during her pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and getting takeout. Now, after the baby was born, he's reverting to his old ways, and the wife is still expecting those changes to continue. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. During pregnancy, the husband made accommodations, which is understandable because pregnancy can be physically and emotionally challenging. However, postpartum is also a time when the mother might have different needs, especially with a new baby. The husband might feel that the accommodations were temporary, while the wife might see them as part of a new normal for their household now that they have a child.\n\nIs the husband wrong for not continuing these changes? Well, he's trying to assert his own boundaries again. The bathroom issue, for example, seems trivial but could be a point of contention if not discussed. The TV and food issues are about shared responsibilities and financial management. The husband might be right to want to balance these things, especially if the takeout is affecting the budget and his ability to take care of the baby.\n\nHowever, the way he's framing his actions might come off as dismissive. He says things like \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink. Surprise, it does,\" which could be seen as disrespectful. That kind of language can hurt his wife's feelings and undermine her needs, even if he thinks they're unreasonable now.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be struggling with postpartum adjustments and could be relying on those accommodations for her comfort or mental health. The husband's sudden return to old habits without discussion could be causing stress for her during a vulnerable time.\n\nSo, the crux is communication. The husband is in the wrong if he didn't talk to his wife about his feelings and expectations after the baby was born. Instead of just reverting, he should have discussed the changes and found a compromise. His initial actions might be justified if both parties agreed, but since they haven't communicated, it's causing conflict. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't address the issue collaboratively and used a dismissive tone.\n"
