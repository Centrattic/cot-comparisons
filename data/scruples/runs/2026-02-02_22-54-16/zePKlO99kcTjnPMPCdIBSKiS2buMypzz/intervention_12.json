Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he made a lot of accommodations, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now, after the baby was born, he's trying to revert back to their normal habits but the wife is still expecting him to follow those changes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author's point is that he was accommodating during pregnancy because he loved his wife and wanted to make her comfortable. Now that the baby is born, he feels like those accommodations are no longer necessary. He gives examples like the bathroom smell, TV control, and takeout food. He feels like he's being unreasonable now because, for instance, everyone's bathroom does stink, and he's not in the budget for takeout anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's perspective might be that after childbirth, she's dealing with a lot of physical and emotional changes, and the baby's needs are also a factor. Maybe she's still feeling vulnerable or tired, and the author reverting back to old habits might be adding stress. The bathroom issue could be about sensitivity during recovery, or maybe she's dealing with postpartum symptoms. The TV control could be her needing more downtime to cope, and the takeout might be about not having the energy to cook. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is inconsiderate by not acknowledging that the wife's needs might have changed, even if the pregnancy-related reasons are gone. The author might think he's being fair by returning to normal, but the wife might still need some accommodations postpartum. \n\nI should also consider cultural expectations. In some cases, the postpartum period is seen as a time where the mother needs extra care, which could be why she's still expecting those changes. The author might not be in the wrong if he's communicating his needs, but the issue is how they're handling the transition. \n\nHowever, the author is making some judgments, like saying the bathroom smell is \"insulting\" and that the wife's preferences are \"ridiculous\" during pregnancy. That could come off as dismissive, which might be part of the problem. If he's not respectful in his approach, even if his actions are reasonable, that could be the issue. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect with takeout is a practical concern. If it's straining the budget, he has a valid point, but maybe the wife sees it as necessary for her well-being. The author might need to find a middle ground, like cooking meals together or finding a cheaper alternative instead of just stopping takeout abruptly.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to return to their normal routine, but he might be in the wrong if he's not considering the wife's ongoing needs postpartum. The way he's communicating his changes could be the problem. The answer might hinge on whether his actions are respectful and considerate, not just the actions themselves.\n"
