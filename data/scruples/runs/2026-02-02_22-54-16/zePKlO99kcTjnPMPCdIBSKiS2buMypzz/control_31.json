Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author going back to their old ways after their wife gave birth, while the wife still expects the changes they made during pregnancy to continue.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband says he gave into many of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even if they were \"ridiculous.\" After the birth, he's reverting to their old habits, but the wife is still expecting him to follow those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out food. The husband feels these things are unfair now that the pregnancy is over.\n\nNow, considering the husband's perspective: He argues that during pregnancy, he made sacrifices out of love and consideration for her comfort, especially since she was feeling unwell. Now, with the baby born, he feels those accommodations aren't necessary anymore. The examples given are about practical things like bathroom use, TV control, and takeout. He's concerned about the budget and his own comfort.\n\nFrom the wife's side, she might be struggling with postpartum adjustments. Hormonal changes, lack of sleep, and caring for a newborn can make it harder to let go of the comfort provided during pregnancy. She might feel that these changes are still important for her well-being or that the husband isn't supporting her post-birth.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong by reverting. The key factors here are mutual respect and communication. The husband made a reasonable effort during pregnancy, which is commendable. However, after the birth, it's important to reassess what's needed for both partners. The wife's continued insistence might be due to lingering physical or emotional needs postpartum. \n\nBut the husband is also within his rights to express that he can't continue things that no longer make sense. For example, not using the upstairs bathroom because of smell isn't a health issue, so the husband's return to normal is reasonable. The takeout issue relates to the budget, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the husband could be approaching this with more empathy. Instead of reverting abruptly, discussing the changes with his wife and finding a middle ground might help. The problem might stem from a lack of communication rather than him being in the wrong. But according to the question, is he the one at fault? The husband is not wrong for wanting to adjust, but the way he's handling it could be improved. \n\nThe examples given don't show him being intentionally hurtful. He's trying to balance his needs and the practical aspects of their life. The wife's expectations might be unreasonable now, especially if her needs have changed. So, considering all this, the husband isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
