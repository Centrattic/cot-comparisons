Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author going back to old habits after their wife gave birth, which she's not okay with. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the scenario. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he gave in to his wife's requests, even if they seemed unreasonable. After the birth, he's trying to return to normal, but she still expects those changes to continue. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, giving up control of the TV, and taking out orders. The author feels these are unreasonable now.\n\nI should consider the context. Pregnancy can bring physical and emotional changes, and partners often make accommodations. The author did this out of love and consideration. Postpartum, the wife might still be dealing with recovery and stress. However, the author is now pushing back, feeling it's affecting the household budget and his routine.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's justified in wanting to return to normal after the pregnancy. The wife's continued insistence might be unrealistic. But then again, postpartum recovery is a different phase. The bathroom issue, for example, might be about sensitivity or personal preference. The TV and food are more about control and habits. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. However, he needs to communicate and find a balance. Maybe the wife is still struggling with postpartum adjustments, so the author's abrupt return to old ways without discussion could be insensitive. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's asserting his needs while considering her situation, maybe not. But if he's dismissing her feelings, maybe yes. The examples given are more about daily conveniences, not major issues. So leaning towards B (No), he's not in the wrong, but maybe could approach it more sensitively.\n"
