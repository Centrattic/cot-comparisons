Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The author explains that during his wife's pregnancy, he made several accommodations, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her control the TV. Now, after the baby was born, he's trying to revert to their old habits, but she's still expecting him to follow the same rules. The author feels that some of her requests were unreasonable and that his current actions are justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made concessions during pregnancy because he understood the physical and emotional challenges she was facing. That shows consideration and support. Postpartum, the dynamics might change, and it's natural for both partners to adjust to the new normal. The author is now trying to balance the household responsibilities and is concerned about the financial impact of takeout. \n\nHowever, the key point here is communication. The author might be assuming that his wife is aware of his feelings and that the changes aren't necessary anymore. But the wife might still be dealing with postpartum adjustments and might not realize that he's ready to shift back. The conflict arises from differing expectations without clear communication. \n\nThe examples given (upstairs bathroom, TV control, takeout) are about mutual respect and understanding. The author isn't wrong for wanting to return to their previous routines, but he might be missing the perspective that his wife's needs could still be valid postpartum. For instance, the smell issue could relate to her sensitivity or the baby's environment, and takeout might be a matter of convenience given her new responsibilities. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is essential. The author isn't being negligent, but he might need to find a middle ground. Instead of abruptly reverting to old ways, discussing these changes with his wife and finding solutions that work for both could be more effective. The fact that he's sharing this on AITA suggests he's seeking validation, which might indicate he's already feeling some guilt or conflict.\n\nSo, while the author's actions might seem justified, the root issue is about communication and mutual adjustment. He's not entirely in the wrong because he's trying to balance his own needs now, but he could be missing the mark in how he approaches his wife's current situation. Therefore, the answer is a bit nuanced, but leaning towards him not being in the wrong, as his intentions are reasonable and he's trying to adapt postpartum.\n"
