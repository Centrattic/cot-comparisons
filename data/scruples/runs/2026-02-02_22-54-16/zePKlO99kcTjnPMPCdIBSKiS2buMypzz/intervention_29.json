I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he gave in to a lot of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, but after the baby was born, he's trying to go back to their old ways, and she's still expecting those changes. The examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and doing takeout for her. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's perspective is that he complied with his wife's requests during pregnancy out of consideration for her health and comfort. Now that the baby is born, he's returning to normal, but she's still insisting on those changes. He feels like some of the requests were excessive, like the bathroom smell, and that things like takeout are hurting the budget.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that these adjustments were necessary for her well-being during pregnancy and perhaps even postpartum. Pregnancy can cause physical discomfort and emotional stress, so her requests might have been justified at the time. Postpartum, she might still be dealing with physical recovery and the challenges of caring for a newborn, making those accommodations important for her mental and physical health. If she's insisting on continuing these changes, maybe she's still dealing with some aftereffects of pregnancy or the stress of motherhood.\n\nThe key is to determine if the husband is being inconsiderate by reverting to old habits now that the pregnancy is over. The bathroom issue: during pregnancy, maybe the smell was a trigger for nausea, which is common. Post-birth, she might still be sensitive or have a low threshold for odors due to hormonal changes or fatigue. The husband might find it trivial, but for her, it could be a real issue. Similarly, controlling the TV might be her way of coping with the stress and limited mobility postpartum. Takeout could be about convenience since she's adjusting to new responsibilities and might not have the energy to cook.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that these were temporary adjustments and he's entitled to his habits now. However, if his wife is still struggling, maybe she needs those accommodations to manage her new role and recovery. The conflict arises from differing needs and expectations postpartum. The husband might not fully understand the ongoing challenges she's facing, leading to him reverting and her feeling unsupported.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's ignoring her ongoing needs without considering her perspective, he might be. But if he's trying to balance household responsibilities and his own well-being, there's a case for his position. However, the expectations during pregnancy don't necessarily carry over, and he might have a right to his own habits. The answer hinges on communication and mutual understanding. If he's not being malicious but rather trying to return to normalcy, he might not be the asshole, but there's room for compromise.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the community often considers the intent and whether anyone is being unreasonably stubborn. The husband's intent seems to be about returning to a balanced life, but maybe he's not acknowledging his wife's continued needs. Without more context on how their communication is going or if there's been a discussion, it's hard to say definitively. But based on the information given, the husband's actions might not be entirely in the wrong if he's making an effort to adjust but not at the expense of his own needs. However, the wife's continued insistence might be valid if she's still dealing with postpartum challenges. So, the answer is B (No), as he's not in the wrong, but there's room for dialogue and compromise.\n"
