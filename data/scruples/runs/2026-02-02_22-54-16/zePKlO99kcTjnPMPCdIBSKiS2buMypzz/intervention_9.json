Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The author is a husband who adjusted his behavior during his wife's pregnancy, but now, after she gave birth, he's reverting to old habits and she's still expecting him to follow the same changes. The key points here are the specific examples given: not using the upstairs bathroom, giving up the TV, and taking out orders for takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to make accommodations due to the physical and emotional changes the pregnant person is experiencing. Morning sickness, sensitivity to smells, and other symptoms can be very real. So, the husband's compliance during that period seems reasonable as an act of support and care.\n\nNow, after the baby is born, the wife is still insisting on these changes. The husband feels these are no longer necessary. The bathroom issue: the smell might not be as problematic for her anymore, and he finds it insulting to still avoid it. The TV control: maybe she's using it as a way to cope with the stress postpartum or the new responsibilities. The takeout: it's affecting the budget, so he wants to stop.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if it's fair for the husband to revert now. On one hand, he's adjusting back to normal after the temporary changes. On the other hand, the wife might still need some support postpartum, especially with a new baby. However, the examples given are things that might not be essential anymore. The smell issue is something everyone deals with, so maybe the accommodation was unnecessary unless there was a medical reason. The TV control could be a matter of household dynamics, but if it's causing friction, communication is key. The takeout might be a financial issue and about dividing responsibilities now that the baby is here.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's changes were made under duress or for the health of the wife. If the wife's requests were reasonable during pregnancy (like avoiding certain smells that trigger nausea), then postpartum, those same rules might not apply. The husband isn't being asked to make those changes anymore, but the wife is still expecting them. It's possible she's struggling with the transition back to normalcy after the intense pregnancy period and the new baby's arrival.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the accommodations were necessary during pregnancy and now are causing conflict, it's a matter of adjusting expectations. The husband is trying to balance his needs and the family's budget. However, the wife might still need some support, but the examples given don't necessarily indicate that. The bathroom smell is a universal issue, so maybe the accommodation was temporary. The TV control is about household management, and the takeout is a financial issue.\n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because the accommodations were during a specific period (pregnancy) and after the baby is born, those might not be necessary. He's trying to find a balance and communicate his limits, which is reasonable. The wife's continued insistence might be a matter of adjustment, but the husband isn't wrong for wanting to return to normal practices. So the answer would be B.\n"
