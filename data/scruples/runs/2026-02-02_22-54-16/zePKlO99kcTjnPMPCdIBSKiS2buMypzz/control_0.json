That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. So the author is a husband who, during his wife's pregnancy, gave in to a lot of her requests, even the ridiculous ones. Now that their daughter was born, he's going back to the old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes to stay. The examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out for takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience nausea, heightened sense of smell, and other physical discomforts. The husband accommodating her by not using a certain bathroom because the smell was too much for her makes sense during that time. Postpartum, though, the wife is still expecting that same accommodation. The husband is now upset about it because he finds it insulting and it's affecting their budget.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a typical perspective, supporting a partner during pregnancy is seen as a positive, even if some requests seem excessive. After birth, the adjustments might still be necessary, especially if the wife is dealing with postpartum issues. The husband is reverting to his old ways, which could be seen as not considering her ongoing needs. For example, the bathroom issue: maybe she's still sensitive to smells after giving birth. The husband's comment about her \"shit doesn't stink\" could come off as dismissive and disrespectful, which is a red flag.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is dealing with the reality of their new life, including the budget and shared responsibilities. He's taking over baby duty and might feel overburdened. The key here is communication. If the husband and wife haven't discussed the changes postpartum, that could be a problem. The husband might feel that after pregnancy, the accommodations aren't needed anymore, but the wife might still need them for her comfort and recovery.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a balance. Both partners need to adjust and communicate. The husband's actions in going back to old ways without discussing them with his wife could be seen as inconsiderate. The wife's insistence might be reasonable if she's still dealing with physical or emotional challenges. The husband's frustration over the budget is valid, but there might be a middle ground, like setting a budget for takeout or finding alternatives.\n\nThe husband's tone in the examples (like calling the TV shows \"trashy\") and the comment about the bathroom smell being \"insulting\" suggest a lack of empathy. This could be contributing to the tension. It's possible that the wife feels her needs are still valid postpartum, and the husband isn't recognizing that. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering that some accommodations might still be necessary and for not communicating his feelings in a respectful way.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the wife is being unreasonable and the husband is justified in wanting to return to their pre-pregnancy norms. But given the typical dynamics, especially the husband's dismissive language and the potential for the wife still needing support, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. But I have to be careful not to assume. The key is whether the husband's actions are respectful and considerate of his wife's situation postpartum.\n"
