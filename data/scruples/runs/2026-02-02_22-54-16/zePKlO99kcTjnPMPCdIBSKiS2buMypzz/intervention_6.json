I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who is the husband in this situation) is in the wrong for going back to his old ways after his wife gave birth. The wife had certain requests during her pregnancy that he complied with, but now she's still enforcing them, and he's pushing back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to make accommodations because the pregnant person might be dealing with physical discomfort, nausea, or other issues. The husband gave in to these requests even if they seemed unreasonable. Now that the baby is born, the wife is still expecting the same changes, which he finds unnecessary or even insulting. \n\nThe examples given: not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell, letting her control the TV for watching shows, and running out for takeout. The husband feels that these are no longer valid after the baby is born. The wife might be clinging to these habits for comfort or because she's still adjusting to postpartum life, but the husband is trying to return to their previous normal.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband isn't wrong for wanting to resume his old habits, especially if they were temporary adjustments made during pregnancy. The key point is whether the husband's actions are dismissive of his wife's feelings. The wife might be struggling with postpartum adjustments, and the husband's return to old ways could be seen as not supporting her. However, if the accommodations were only necessary during pregnancy and not during postpartum, then the husband's stance is reasonable.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband should ideally discuss these changes with his wife rather than just reverting. If he's abrupt about it without considering her feelings, that could be problematic. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to go back. The fact that he's trying to manage the budget and his own needs (like taking over baby watch) might give him some leeway.\n\nHowever, there's a balance. The wife might still be dealing with postpartum issues, so the husband needs to be empathetic. But the original accommodations were made for her well-being during pregnancy. After birth, the needs might have changed, and the husband's desire to return to normal is understandable. The issue is whether the wife's continued enforcement is reasonable. If she's still experiencing issues that require these accommodations, the husband might need to be more flexible. But if not, then he's not necessarily wrong.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often an assumption that new parents should make sacrifices for each other, but that shouldn't mean one person is always expected to give up their own comforts. The husband's actions might be seen as fair if he's not being disrespectful, just reverting to pre-pregnancy norms.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's making reasonable adjustments postpartum, especially if the wife's current behavior is unreasonable. However, the communication aspect is crucial. The husband should approach this with empathy and dialogue, but the act of returning to his old ways isn't inherently wrong.\n"
