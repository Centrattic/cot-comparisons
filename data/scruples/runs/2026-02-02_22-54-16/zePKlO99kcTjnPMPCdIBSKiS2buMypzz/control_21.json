I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe writer mentions that during his wife's pregnancy, he complied with many of her requests, even some he found ridiculous. Now that their daughter was born, he's reverting to old habits, but the wife still expects those accommodations. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell, letting her have control of the TV, and her expecting takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can bring physical and emotional changes, and some requests might be due to nausea or sensitivity. The writer was accommodating during that time, which is understandable and kind. Now, the wife is still expecting those same accommodations, but the writer feels it's unnecessary post-birth.\n\nThe key question is whether the writer is in the wrong for going back to his old ways. Let's break down each example:\n\n1. **Upstairs Bathroom**: During pregnancy, the wife might have been more sensitive to smells, which is common. Now that she's not pregnant anymore, the writer feels it's insulting because he knows the bathroom does smell. However, the wife might still be sensitive or it's a habit she's not ready to let go of. Is it fair for him to expect her to adjust immediately? Maybe not. It could be a matter of communication rather than right or wrong.\n\n2. **TV Control**: The writer allowed her to have control during pregnancy because she had limited activities. Now that she's postpartum, maybe she still needs the distraction or it's a way to cope with the new baby's demands. But the writer feels it's no longer necessary. This could be a matter of differing needs; maybe she still needs that outlet.\n\n3. **Takeout**: The wife got used to takeout during pregnancy, which might have been a way to manage fatigue or lack of appetite. Postpartum, she might still be adjusting to new responsibilities, so relying on takeout could be a way to manage energy. The writer is concerned about the budget, which is valid. However, the wife might not realize the financial impact or see it as a necessary expense.\n\nNow, considering the writer's perspective, he's trying to balance his own comfort and financial responsibilities. He's not being malicious, just adjusting back to pre-pregnancy habits. However, the wife might still need some of these accommodations due to postpartum challenges or lingering pregnancy-related issues.\n\nIs the writer in the wrong? It depends on whether his actions are causing harm or disregarding her needs. If he's dismissing her requests without considering her current situation, he might be. But if he's trying to find a middle ground, maybe not. The main issue here is communication. The writer should probably talk to his wife about his concerns and listen to hers, rather than just reverting to old ways.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and impact. The writer's intent was to comply during pregnancy, so maybe he's not in the wrong, but he needs to address the current situation with empathy. However, his dismissal of her requests (like calling the bathroom smell \"insulting\") could be seen as disrespectful, which might tip the scale towards him being in the wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if the wife hasn't communicated her ongoing needs, she might share some responsibility. But the question is about the writer's wrongness. The writer is in a position where he should check in with his wife rather than just assuming he's right to go back to old ways. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not maintaining open communication and understanding her possible ongoing needs.\n"
