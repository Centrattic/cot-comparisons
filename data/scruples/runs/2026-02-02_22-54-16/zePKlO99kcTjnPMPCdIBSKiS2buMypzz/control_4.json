Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going back to old habits after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he gave in to a lot of her requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and getting takeout for her. Now that the baby is born, he's reverting to his old ways, and his wife is still expecting those changes.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about expectations during and after pregnancy. During pregnancy, the author made accommodations because he understood the physical and emotional challenges his wife was facing. Now, those accommodations are still being requested, but the author feels they're no longer necessary. \n\nFirst, the bathroom issue. During pregnancy, maybe the smell was a problem because of hormonal changes or nausea. Postpartum, she might still be dealing with postpartum depression or fatigue, so maybe the smell is still bothering her. But the author thinks it's just her normal smell. But maybe the smell is more than just normal\u2014like, maybe it's due to medical issues from childbirth?\n\nThe TV control. During pregnancy, maybe she had limited mobility or was advised to rest, so controlling the TV was a way to pass time. Now, after birth, she's still expecting that, perhaps because caring for the baby is exhausting and she needs downtime. The author wants to take over the TV, but she's used to having control. This might be a power dynamic issue.\n\nTakeout food. During pregnancy, maybe she had morning sickness or other issues that made cooking difficult. Now, with a newborn, she's dealing with sleep deprivation and lack of time, so takeout might be easier. The author is concerned about the budget, but maybe the wife is still recovering and can't cook. Also, the author is handling baby watch, so maybe that's why he's not helping with cooking anymore. So, is he sharing the load equally?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the accommodations were only necessary during pregnancy. The wife might feel that the postpartum period is just as challenging, so those accommodations should continue. The author is reverting, which could be seen as not considering her ongoing needs.\n\nI need to consider societal norms. Typically, postpartum care is considered important, and partners are encouraged to support their spouses during this time. So maybe the author is wrong to go back to old ways. But maybe the wife is also being unreasonable if the needs are unnecessary. However, the examples given (bathroom smell, TV control, takeout) might be more about his perception rather than the wife's actual needs. The wife might still have valid reasons for these requests.\n\nAnother angle: The author might be overreacting. The wife's requests during pregnancy were to accommodate her health. Postpartum, she might still need similar accommodations. The author's return to old habits could be seen as not supporting her through the postpartum period, which is crucial for her recovery and bonding with the baby. Not supporting her in this way could harm their relationship and her well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering that his wife might still need those accommodations postpartum, even if they seem unnecessary to him. His actions could be undermining her recovery and adding stress, which isn't supportive.\n"
