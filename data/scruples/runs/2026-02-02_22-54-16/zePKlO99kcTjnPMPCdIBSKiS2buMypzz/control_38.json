That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that after the birth of their child, the husband is going back to his old ways, not following the same rules he did during the pregnancy. The wife was pregnant and had certain requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom and having control of the TV. Now, post-birth, he's reverting, and she's upset.\n\nSo the question is whether the author (the husband) is wrong. Let's break it down. During pregnancy, many women experience nausea and heightened sense of smell, so avoiding certain smells can be necessary. The husband complied then, which was considerate. After the baby's born, the wife is still insisting on these changes, but the husband is pushing back. \n\nThe key here is whether the changes are still necessary. The husband argues that the smell of the bathroom is normal now, and the TV control was just for the pregnancy period. Also, the takeout is affecting the budget. The wife might feel that these accommodations are still needed, maybe due to postpartum challenges, or she's used to the convenience. \n\nBut the husband is reverting, which could be seen as not considering her continued needs. However, some might argue that after the pregnancy, the original reasons (like nausea) are gone, so the accommodations aren't necessary anymore. On the other hand, postpartum can be a stressful time, and the wife might need some adjustments. \n\nThe husband's frustration about the budget is valid, but he should communicate that with his wife. The issue seems to be communication. Maybe the wife expects some changes to continue, while the husband feels they should go back. The husband isn't entirely wrong in wanting to return to normal, but he might be missing the fact that postpartum is a different phase where some needs persist. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If the husband is disregarding his wife's current needs without discussion, that's a problem. But if the reasons for the changes (like the bathroom smell) are no longer valid, then maybe he's not wrong. The answer might depend on whether the wife's current needs are justified. Since the question is about the husband's actions, if he's not considering her postpartum situation, he could be in the wrong. But if the changes were only needed during pregnancy, then he's not. The examples given (bathroom smell, TV control) might not be valid post-birth, so the husband's pushback could be reasonable. However, the way he's framing it as \"insulting\" might be dismissive of her feelings. \n\nHmm. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the accommodations aren't needed anymore. But maybe the wife's perspective is that she's still adjusting, and the husband isn't being supportive. The husband's frustration is about the budget and personal habits, but he needs to negotiate with his wife rather than unilaterally changing things. So maybe the husband is partially in the wrong for not communicating and considering her ongoing needs. However, the original question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be B because the changes were during pregnancy, but he's trying to return to normal. But I'm a bit torn. The key is that postpartum can have its own challenges, so maybe the wife's needs are still valid. The husband's actions could be seen as reverting without considering that. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong). Wait, but the husband's examples are about things that were specific to pregnancy. Like the bathroom smell was due to her sensitivity during pregnancy. After birth, unless she's still sensitive, it's reasonable to go back. But if she's postpartum, maybe she's more sensitive again. The husband's comment about \"her shit doesn't stink\" is dismissive, which is not great. That's probably where the problem is. He's not respecting her current feelings. So even if the reasons are different, he's being rude. So maybe the answer is A. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The husband's actions of going back to old ways might be justified if the original reasons are gone, but his attitude is dismissive. The problem is that the wife is still expecting some accommodations, and he's not being empathetic. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering his wife's possible ongoing needs and is being dismissive in his comments.\n"
