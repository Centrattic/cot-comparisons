Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who, during his wife's pregnancy, gave in to many of her requests. Now that the baby was born, he's trying to return to their old ways, but the wife is still expecting those accommodations. The examples given are using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout food.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The husband argues that he's just going back to normal and that the wife's current demands are unreasonable. For instance, the bathroom smell\u2014during pregnancy, maybe the wife had nausea or sensitivity, so avoiding that bathroom made sense. But now, after childbirth, the smell is just a normal bodily function. The husband is frustrated because he's dealing with it but feels it's unfair. Similarly, the TV and takeout are things he was accommodating during pregnancy, but now he's pushing back because of budget and personal time.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, stress, and fatigue. Maybe she's used to certain comforts and isn't ready to drop them. The husband is taking on baby watch duties, which is a positive, but maybe the wife still needs some adjustments for her own well-being. The key here is communication. Did they talk about this transition from pregnancy to postpartum life? Without that, it's easy for one person to feel they're being unreasonable.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance. The husband's actions are understandable, but perhaps he should be more empathetic to the wife's needs during the postpartum period. The smell issue\u2014while it's true that bodily functions have odors, maybe she's still sensitive or dealing with a medical issue. The takeout could be a habit she's used to, and now that she's home with a newborn, maybe she doesn't have the energy to cook. So, the husband might need to find a middle ground, like using air freshener for the bathroom or planning meals in advance instead of takeout every time.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's just reverting to old habits without considering her postpartum situation, maybe he is. But if he's open to discussion and compromise, then it's a communication issue rather than being wrong. The examples given show the husband's frustration, but not necessarily that he's wrong. It's possible he's not wrong, but he needs to approach it with more understanding. So the answer might be B (No), but with the caveat that communication is key.\n"
