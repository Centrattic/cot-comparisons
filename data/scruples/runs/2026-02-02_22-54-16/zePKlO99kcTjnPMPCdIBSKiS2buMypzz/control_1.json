Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about him going back to his old ways after his wife gave birth, but she wants the changes to stay. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the examples he gave. During pregnancy, he gave in to her requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her control the TV. Now, after the baby was born, he's reverting, and she's upset.\n\nThe key here is whether his actions post-birth are reasonable. Let's consider each point. The bathroom issue: during pregnancy, the smell bothered her, so he avoided it. Now that she's had the baby, maybe she's still sensitive, or maybe she's just used to it. But the writer is saying it's insulting because \"her shit doesn't stink.\" That's a bit harsh; maybe the smell is a real issue for her, or maybe she's still dealing with postpartum emotions. The writer might be dismissing her feelings here.\n\nTV control: during pregnancy, he let her watch whatever she wanted because she couldn't do much. Now, post-birth, maybe she still wants that control, or maybe she's adjusting to new routines. The writer is taking back control, which could be a point of contention. \n\nFood: He used to run out for takeout, which hurt the budget. Now he's stopping, but she's expecting him to keep doing it. This could be a financial issue. The writer might be right about the budget, but his wife might see it as a regression in his support.\n\nThe writer claims he's reverting to old ways, but the wife is still expecting the pregnancy accommodations. The question is whether he's wrong to stop after the baby is born. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. If he didn't talk to her about these changes and their reasons, that's a problem. Also, some of the accommodations during pregnancy were likely out of care and support. If he's now being dismissive of her needs post-birth, that could be hurtful. \n\nBut on the other hand, some of his points are valid, like the budget issue. He's taking over baby duty, so maybe he's overextended. The wife might need to adjust expectations, but if she's still in a vulnerable postpartum state, expecting her to adjust immediately might be too much.\n\nThe writer's tone is a bit dismissive, especially with the \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink\" comment. That could come off as insensitive. However, the core issue is about balancing his own needs and the financial aspect against her needs. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is asking if the writer is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (yes) if his actions are hurtful or not considerate. But if he's just trying to return to normal and the wife is being unreasonable, it's B (no). \n\nConsidering that the wife is still in the postpartum period, which is a time when she might need extra support, the writer's abrupt reversal of accommodations without discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. The financial argument is valid, but he should have addressed it with her instead of just stopping. So, the answer might be A.\n"
