Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went back to their old ways after the wife gave birth, but the wife is still expecting the changes made during her pregnancy to continue. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, the author made accommodations because the wife was pregnant and likely dealing with physical discomfort or health issues. For example, avoiding the upstairs bathroom due to the smell, allowing control of the TV, and taking out the trash. These actions were probably done out of care and support during a time when the wife needed it more.\n\nNow, after giving birth, the author is reverting to their old habits. The wife is upset, still expecting those changes. The author feels that some of the requests were unreasonable and that continuing them is unfair, especially since the baby is now there and the financial situation is tighter. The key points here are about mutual expectations and communication.\n\nI should think about whether the author's actions are reasonable. During pregnancy, there are often physical and emotional changes that require adjustments from the partner. However, after the baby is born, the circumstances change. The author is trying to return to a more balanced routine. But the wife might be struggling with adjusting to new roles as a mother and might need continued support, especially if she's dealing with postpartum issues or caring for a newborn.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid, considering the financial strain and the return to normalcy. However, the wife's perspective is also important. She might feel that the adjustments made during pregnancy were necessary for her well-being, and expecting them to stop abruptly could cause tension. The question is whether the author should have discussed these changes with the wife before reverting or if there's a middle ground.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author didn't mention talking to the wife about these changes. If he just went back to old ways without discussing it, that could be an issue. On the other hand, if the wife had not communicated her expectations clearly postpartum, that's on her. But in relationships, both parties need to communicate their needs and boundaries. \n\nThe examples given (bathroom, TV, food) seem trivial but can be stress points. The author might feel that the wife is being unreasonable, but the wife might feel that the support during pregnancy was important for her mental health. Postpartum can be a challenging time, and adjusting to new roles can cause stress. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has a right to his comfort and financial considerations, but the wife's needs postpartum should also be considered. The lack of communication might be the root of the problem. If the author didn't check in with his wife about expectations after the baby was born, that's a valid point. But if the wife is now expecting continued concessions without considering the new dynamics, that could be the issue.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author acted without communication. If he just went back without discussing, then he might be in the wrong. If he tried to communicate and faced resistance, it's different. But based on the post, he says he's going back to old ways, which implies he didn't seek consensus. Therefore, maybe he's in the wrong because he should have communicated and negotiated rather than unilaterally reverting.\n"
