I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who made accommodations during his wife's pregnancy but now, after the baby was born, is reverting to old habits. The wife is still expecting those accommodations.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. During pregnancy, the husband gave in to requests like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her watch TV, and taking out orders. Post-birth, he's trying to go back to normal, but the wife is still enforcing some of those changes. The husband feels it's unfair, especially since some of the requests are no longer necessary (like the bathroom smell isn't an issue anymore), and the takeout is affecting the budget.\n\nThe user thinks the author (husband) isn't in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. From the husband's perspective, he adjusted during pregnancy because he wanted to support her, but now it's over, so he's trying to return to his previous lifestyle. The wife might be struggling with postpartum adjustments, maybe feeling overwhelmed, and relying on those habits for comfort or routine. \n\nIs it fair for him to stop accommodating her post-birth? Well, pregnancy and postpartum are different, and some needs might persist, especially if the wife is dealing with postpartum depression or anxiety. However, the husband's requests were specific to pregnancy symptoms, like nausea. If those aren't ongoing, then expecting him to keep those changes might not be reasonable. The takeout issue is a financial concern, so that's a separate point. \n\nThe husband's frustration seems valid if the original accommodations were temporary. But the wife might feel that the support should continue, especially with a newborn. The key is communication. Did they discuss these changes post-birth? If not, maybe the husband isn't wrong in wanting to adjust, but he might need to approach it with empathy. \n\nLooking at the examples: the bathroom smell\u2014maybe the wife's sensitivity was during pregnancy. The TV and takeout might be more about her getting used to the routine. The husband's point is that he's now taking over baby duty, so he's overburdened. \n\nIn terms of right/wrong, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to adjust after pregnancy. The wife's expectations might be based on the pregnancy period, which isn't the same as postpartum. However, it's possible the wife needs more support now, and the husband isn't addressing her needs. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the accommodations were during a specific time (pregnancy) and some are no longer necessary, the husband isn't wrong for reverting. The wife might need to adjust her expectations, but that's on her. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
