I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author mentions that during their wife's pregnancy, they gave in to a lot of her requests, even some that seemed ridiculous. Now that the baby was born in October, the author is trying to go back to their old ways, but the wife is still enforcing the changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV during pregnancy, and buying takeout which affects the budget.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's actions during pregnancy were accommodating, which is common and often expected to support a pregnant partner. Postpartum, the author is trying to revert to old habits. The wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery and might need some adjustments. However, the author is pointing out that some of the requests were unreasonable and that it's affecting their life and finances.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing to comply with what they consider unreasonable demands post-pregnancy. The author is trying to balance their own needs and the household's budget. On the other hand, the wife might still need certain accommodations for her recovery or the baby's care.\n\nI need to assess if the author is being selfish by not continuing to accommodate, or if they have a right to expect changes after the pregnancy period. The bathroom issue, for example, the author argues that the smell is normal, so the restriction was unnecessary. The TV and takeout might be about control and habits. The author is trying to maintain boundaries now, which is reasonable.\n\nHowever, postpartum is a challenging time for the wife, and she might be stressed or having a harder time adjusting. The author should consider communication and negotiation rather than just reverting. But the question is about being in the wrong. The wife's continued insistence on the changes could be seen as unreasonable if they're no longer necessary. The author isn't doing anything harmful; they're adjusting their behavior based on new circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is reasonable in wanting to return to normal after pregnancy, especially if the previous accommodations were temporary. The wife's demands postpartum might be excessive if they're unnecessary now. The author isn't being selfish but is seeking balance. However, it's a nuanced situation where communication is key. But based on the given info, the author isn't wrong.\n"
