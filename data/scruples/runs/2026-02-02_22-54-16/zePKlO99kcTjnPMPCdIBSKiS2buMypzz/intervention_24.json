Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that after his wife gave birth, he went back to his old habits, but she's still expecting him to follow the changes he made during her pregnancy. The examples given include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and buying takeout for her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. During the pregnancy, the husband made a lot of accommodations, even some he found ridiculous. Now, after the baby is born, he's trying to return to normal, but the wife is still expecting those changes. The key here is whether his actions post-birth are reasonable.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the wife was dealing with pregnancy-related issues, so the husband's accommodations were considerate at the time. After the baby is born, those reasons might no longer apply. For instance, the bathroom issue: during pregnancy, maybe the smell was more intense for her, but after childbirth, perhaps it's not necessary. Similarly, the TV control and takeout might have been to accommodate her limited mobility or nausea during pregnancy, which isn't relevant anymore.\n\nHowever, there's a potential problem here. The wife might still be adjusting postpartum, both physically and emotionally. The husband's return to old ways could be seen as dismissive of her needs now. Maybe she's still dealing with postpartum recovery, stress, or sleep deprivation, and these accommodations help her cope. The bathroom issue could be about her comfort, and the takeout might be about saving her energy for the baby.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is right that some of these things were temporary. The smell of the bathroom should be a normal part of life, and expecting him not to use it is unreasonable. The TV and takeout can be a financial strain if not addressed. The husband is trying to find a balance between his own needs and his wife's, which is a common issue in relationships.\n\nIt's also important to consider communication. If the husband didn't talk to his wife about his feelings and just went back to old ways, that could be a problem. But the post doesn't mention that. It sounds like he's frustrated and maybe didn't consider her perspective post-birth.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's actions are understandable, but he should also consider that some adjustments might still be needed for his wife. The answer hinges on whether returning to old habits without considering her current needs is inconsiderate. If he's not accommodating her postpartum needs, then he might be in the wrong. But if those accommodations were only necessary during pregnancy, then he's justified in stopping them.\n\nI think the husband is not in the wrong. The accommodations were made for a specific reason during pregnancy, which no longer applies. However, he should communicate with his wife to find a middle ground, especially if she's still needing some support. But based on the information given, the actions he's taking to return to normal aren't necessarily wrong. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
