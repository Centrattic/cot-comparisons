Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The author wrote about returning to old habits after their wife gave birth, which she's not happy with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, the author made accommodations for the wife's needs, which is common. After childbirth, the author wants to revert to their previous routines. The wife is expecting those changes to continue, but the author feels it's unreasonable.\n\nExamples given include not using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout. The author argues that some accommodations are no longer necessary. The key here is whether the author's actions are inconsiderate or if they're within their rights to adjust after pregnancy.\n\nI should consider societal norms and expectations. It's often expected that partners make sacrifices during pregnancy and postpartum. However, the author is now resisting continuing those changes, which might be seen as a return to normalcy. The wife might feel that her comfort is still important, especially with a newborn. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of mutual respect and communication. If the author communicated their feelings and tried to find a compromise, that's different. If they just went back without discussion, that could be problematic. The examples like the bathroom smell and takeout might be seen as practical changes postpartum, but the author feels they're unreasonable.\n\nI should also consider the financial aspect. Taking out money for takeout might be a valid concern. However, the wife might feel that her postpartum needs are not being considered. The balance between personal boundaries and supporting each other is crucial here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners need to adjust. The author might be justified in wanting to ease up, but the way they went back might be abrupt or dismissive. The tone of the examples, like the bathroom smell comment, could come off as disrespectful, which might indicate the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they might not be considering the wife's continued needs postpartum. However, if they made a mutual agreement, it's different. Without that, their actions could be seen as reverting without considering her ongoing challenges.\n"
