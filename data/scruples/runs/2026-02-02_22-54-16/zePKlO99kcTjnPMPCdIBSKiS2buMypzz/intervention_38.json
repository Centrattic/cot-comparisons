Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went along with his wife's requests during her pregnancy, but after the birth, he's trying to go back to their old ways, and the wife is still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, giving up the TV remote, and taking out takeout orders.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, during pregnancy, the author complied with the wife's requests, which he found ridiculous but did them out of consideration. After the baby was born, he's reverting to normal, but the wife is still expecting the same. The key here is whether the author is wrong to stop complying now.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, compromise is important. The author did his part during pregnancy, which was respectful. Now, the wife is still expecting those same concessions postpartum. But postpartum can be a challenging time for the mother, physically and emotionally. Maybe she's still dealing with recovery, stress, or adjusting to the new baby. The author's examples\u2014like avoiding the upstairs bathroom\u2014might be about her comfort, not just being picky. Even if the smell is normal, during pregnancy sensitivity can be heightened. Maybe she's still dealing with that sensitivity or other issues postpartum.\n\nThe food and TV issues: during pregnancy, he gave up control of the TV and takeout. Postpartum, he's not doing it anymore. But the wife might still be recovering and need those things for her well-being. Also, the takeout affecting the budget is a valid point, but maybe the wife is struggling with the new routine and is used to that convenience. There's a balance here between the husband's financial concerns and the wife's needs. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's within his rights to set boundaries, especially if these changes were temporary. However, the wife's needs postpartum might be different. The author isn't being unreasonable by reverting, but the wife's feelings are valid too. The AITA format often looks for who is being unreasonable. The author is expressing frustration with the ongoing demands, but the wife might be struggling with the postpartum adjustment. \n\nBut the author's examples do seem like they were temporary concessions. The wife's insistence on continuing them might be impractical. The husband's point is that he's reverting to normal, which is reasonable. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. However, there's a nuance here. The wife might need support postpartum, but the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. It's a balance. The key is whether the author's actions are disrespectful. He's not being cruel; he's just not continuing to comply. So I think the answer is B.\n"
