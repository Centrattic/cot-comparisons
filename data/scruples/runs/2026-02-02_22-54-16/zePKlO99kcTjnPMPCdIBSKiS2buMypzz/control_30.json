Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who adjusted a lot during his wife's pregnancy, but after she gave birth, he's going back to old habits and she's still expecting the same changes. The examples given are not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her watch TV, and buying takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience nausea and sensitivity to smells, so avoiding certain bathrooms makes sense. After birth, the smell might still be an issue, but the husband feels it's unfair. However, the wife might still be recovering or have sensitivities postpartum. The husband is now refusing to comply, which could be seen as dismissive of her needs.\n\nFor the TV example, during pregnancy, the wife had more time to watch shows. Postpartum, she might still have limited time or energy, especially with a new baby. The husband's role in taking over baby duty might mean he's not available, but she might still need that downtime. The husband's resistance could be seen as not supporting her.\n\nFood is another point. Buying takeout during pregnancy might have been a way to accommodate her changing tastes or nausea. Postpartum, she might still have dietary needs or lack the energy to cook. The husband's concern about the budget is valid, but not supporting her needs could strain the relationship. It's a balance between financial responsibility and emotional support.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's actions are inconsiderate. The wife's needs during and after pregnancy are significant. The husband's return to old ways without considering her ongoing needs might be seen as the problem. However, the husband's perspective is that he was accommodating during pregnancy and now wants to return to normal. \n\nBut postpartum is a time when women often need continued support. The husband's refusal to adjust could be viewed as not being supportive. The wife's insistence on the changes might be because she still needs them, not just out of habit. The husband's comments (like \"her shit doesn't stink\") could come off as dismissive and hurtful, which isn't helpful.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband should discuss these changes with his wife to find a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The fact that he's not considering her ongoing needs, especially after pregnancy, which is a significant life event, suggests he might be. So the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong).\n"
