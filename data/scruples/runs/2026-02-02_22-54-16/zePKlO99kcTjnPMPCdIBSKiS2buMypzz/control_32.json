I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who gave in to his wife's requests during her pregnancy but now, after giving birth, is reverting to their old ways, which the wife is still expecting him to follow.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband felt he was accommodating during the pregnancy because he knew she was going through a tough time. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to return to normal, but the wife expects the habits to continue. The examples given include not using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout food. The husband finds some of these unreasonable now that the pregnancy is over.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1. Did the husband have a valid reason to change his behavior during pregnancy? 2. Is it reasonable for him to go back to his old ways post-birth? 3. Is the wife being unreasonable in expecting the continued changes?\n\nI think during pregnancy, many people do adjust their behaviors to support the pregnant person's comfort. It's common to make certain sacrifices. However, after the baby is born, the physical discomforts that prompted those changes (like nausea or sensitivity to smells) may no longer be present. The husband might feel that those accommodations were temporary and not necessary anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that some of these changes are still important for her recovery or for the baby's care. For example, maybe she's still sensitive to smells because of hormonal changes postpartum. Or perhaps she's adjusting to new responsibilities and relies on the takeout as a convenience. However, the husband's point about the budget and the desire to return to pre-pregnancy routines is also valid.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong for reverting. If the accommodations were made with the understanding that they were temporary, then he's not in the wrong. But if the wife expected these changes to be permanent, there might be a misunderstanding. However, the husband did say he made these changes because she was pregnant and feeling sick, implying they were temporary. Now that the baby is born, he's not obligated to continue unless there's a new reason. \n\nThe examples given (bathroom smell, TV, takeout) might be considered trivial, but they could also be signs of deeper issues like communication or differing expectations postpartum. The husband is trying to balance his own needs and the household budget against his wife's expectations. It's a common situation where both parties have valid points but need to communicate better. However, the key here is whether he's in the wrong. If he's reverting to old habits that were only suspended during her pregnancy, and she's not experiencing the same issues now, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. But if she's still experiencing similar issues postpartum, that's a different scenario. The husband's frustration with the budget and his own time is understandable. \n\nI think the answer would be that the husband isn't in the wrong (B) because he adjusted during pregnancy as a temporary measure, and now it's reasonable to expect that things can return to normal unless there's a new reason to continue. The wife might need to communicate her expectations better if there are ongoing needs. But based on the information given, the husband's actions are understandable, and the wife's continued insistence might be the issue here. So the answer is B.\n"
