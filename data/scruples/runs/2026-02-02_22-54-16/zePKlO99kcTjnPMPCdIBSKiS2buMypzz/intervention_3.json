Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author reverting to old habits after their wife gave birth, while she still expects them to follow the changes they made during her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was accommodating many of their wife's requests during her pregnancy, even if they seemed excessive, like not using the upstairs bathroom. After the baby was born, the author wants to go back to their normal routine, but the wife is still expecting them to stick to those changes. The author feels this is unreasonable now that the pregnancy is over.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and understanding in a relationship. When someone is pregnant, they might have specific needs due to physical discomfort or health reasons. The author complied then, which was considerate. However, after the baby is born, those same requests might not be as necessary. The author is now struggling with the wife expecting the same accommodations post-birth, which the author finds unfair.\n\nI should consider both sides. The wife might be adjusting to postpartum life and the new baby, which can be stressful. She might be used to the changes made during pregnancy and not yet ready to let go of them. On the other hand, the author feels they are being asked to maintain unreasonable habits that affect their daily life and budget, like takeout orders.\n\nThe author's actions after the baby is born are about returning to their previous normal, which is understandable. The wife's insistence on continuing the changes might be due to habit or lingering discomfort, but it's important to communicate and adjust expectations. The author is not being inconsiderate; they're trying to balance their own needs with the new family dynamics.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue here about how the author is framing the situation. Phrases like \"her shit doesn\u2019t stink. Surprise, it does\" might come off as dismissive or disrespectful, which could be a red flag. The way they're expressing their frustration might be contributing to the tension. But the core issue is about mutual adjustment after a major life change.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to adapt. The author's desire to return to old ways isn't inherently wrong, but it's important to approach the situation with empathy and communication. The wife's needs might still be valid during the postpartum period, so finding a middle ground is key. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to resume their previous habits, but they might need to discuss this with their wife more effectively instead of just reverting without addressing the underlying issues.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication and mutual understanding are crucial here. The author's actions are a return to their normal behavior after a period of making accommodations, which is reasonable, but how they approach this with their wife matters a lot.\n"
