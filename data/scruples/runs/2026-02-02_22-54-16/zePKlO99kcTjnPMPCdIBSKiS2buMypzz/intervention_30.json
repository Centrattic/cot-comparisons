Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going back to old habits after their wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he gave in to a lot of her requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now that the baby is born, he's reverting to the old ways but she's still expecting those changes.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can be a stressful time for the expectant mother, and partners often make accommodations to support them. That's understandable. But after the baby is born, the dynamics might shift. The author is now dealing with the aftermath of those accommodations and finding that maintaining them is becoming a burden or financially draining.\n\nHe gives examples like the bathroom usage, TV control, and takeout. The key points here are whether his actions post-birth are reasonable. Let's break it down. The bathroom issue: he's now upset about the smell, which he says is normal. Maybe during pregnancy, he was being considerate, but after the baby comes, the same consideration might not be necessary. But is it fair to say that the smell is an issue? It's a personal thing, but he's the one who decided to avoid it during pregnancy. Maybe she felt better that way, but now he's pushing back.\n\nTV control: During pregnancy, she had control because she couldn't do much else. Now, with a baby, maybe she still needs some downtime, but the author is pushing back. It's a balance between respecting her needs and his own. The author might feel that the TV control is no longer justified.\n\nTakeout: The financial aspect is a practical concern. If he's covering the costs, that's a valid issue. But the wife might feel that since she's the one who needs the food, especially after childbirth, it's something she's used to. However, the author is now finding it's hurting the budget and wants to stop.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to return to a normal that was adjusted during pregnancy. The wife might feel that the accommodations are still necessary for her recovery or mental health. But the author is trying to manage household responsibilities and finances.\n\nI need to think about mutual respect and communication. Did the author communicate his feelings to his wife? If not, maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to adjust things, but perhaps the way he's handling it is the issue. The examples he gives are about his personal discomfort (smell) and financial strain. Those are valid concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be going through postpartum and have different needs. The author might be dismissing her needs by not continuing the accommodations. But if those accommodations were only necessary during pregnancy and not postpartum, maybe he's justified in reverting.\n\nThe key is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. If the accommodations were temporary during pregnancy and the wife is now expecting them to continue indefinitely, that's where the conflict arises. The author isn't in the wrong for adjusting back to the original norms, especially if they were agreed upon as temporary.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's trying to balance his own needs and practicalities after the pregnancy, which is a normal adjustment period. However, communication is crucial here. If he addresses this with his wife and explains his perspective, they can find a middle ground. But based on the situation as presented, he isn't in the wrong.\n"
