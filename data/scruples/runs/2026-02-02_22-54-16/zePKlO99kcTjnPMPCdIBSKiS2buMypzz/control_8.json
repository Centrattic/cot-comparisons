Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he gave in to a lot of her requests, even if they seemed unreasonable. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to go back to their old routines, but she's still expecting those changes to continue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can be a stressful time for both partners. The husband was accommodating to his wife's needs during pregnancy, which is common. Now, after childbirth, there's a shift in dynamics. The wife might still be recovering physically and emotionally, and the new baby adds another layer of stress. \n\nThe examples he gives: not using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout. The husband feels that the wife's requests are no longer justified post-pregnancy. But maybe the wife is still dealing with postpartum issues, which can last longer than just the immediate post-birth period. Postpartum depression or anxiety might make her cling to the habits she was used to. Also, the new baby requires a lot from both parents, so maybe the husband expects her to adjust, but she's struggling to adapt.\n\nThe husband's frustration is understandable, especially regarding the budget and household responsibilities. However, going back to \"old ways\" abruptly might not consider the wife's current state. The wife might feel that the support she received during pregnancy is something she still needs now, even if the reasons have changed. \n\nCommunication is key here. The husband might be in the wrong if he's not discussing these changes with his wife and not considering her feelings. It's possible that she's still adjusting to being a mother and the physical changes post-birth, making her sensitive about these issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's perspective is that the pregnancy-specific reasons are gone, so the accommodations shouldn't be necessary anymore. But the wife might see the situation as needing continued support during the postpartum period. \n\nI need to weigh whether the husband's actions are reasonable. He's trying to return to normal, but if it's causing conflict and he's not engaging in open communication, that could make him at fault. The key is mutual understanding and compromise. If he's dismissing her needs without dialogue, he's in the wrong. If he's trying to adjust but the wife is being unreasonable, maybe not. But given the context, it seems like the wife might still need support, so the husband might be in the wrong for not considering that.\n"
