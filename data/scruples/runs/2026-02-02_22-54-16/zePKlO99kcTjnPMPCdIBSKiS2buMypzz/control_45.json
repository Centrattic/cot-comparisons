Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand.\n\nSo, the author was accommodating his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even some he found ridiculous, like not using the upstairs bathroom. Now that the baby's born, he's reverting to their old habits, but the wife still expects those changes to stay. The examples include the bathroom, TV control, and takeout food. The author feels that the wife's demands are no longer necessary and are straining the budget. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. During pregnancy, many women experience nausea and sensitivity to smells, so the bathroom restriction makes sense as a temporary measure. After birth, the author thinks it's unreasonable to continue that. Similarly, allowing TV control and takeout was during a time when the wife had limited mobility or energy. Now, with a newborn, the author is handling baby duty and doesn't want to keep running for takeout.\n\nThe key points are about temporary accommodations versus ongoing demands. The author is trying to return to their pre-pregnancy norms, which is understandable. However, the wife might still be adjusting to life with a new baby, dealing with postpartum issues, and might need support. The author's frustration is valid, especially financially, but so is the wife's need for consideration.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he's not being malicious. He was accommodating during a difficult time for his wife, and now is trying to balance things again. However, the wife's needs might still be valid. For example, if she's struggling with postpartum depression or fatigue, the changes might still be necessary. The author should communicate this and find a middle ground. However, the author is not wrong for not wanting to continue unnecessary accommodations. It's a matter of mutual understanding and compromise. The author's actions don't seem cruel, just wanting to realign their life post-pregnancy. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong."
