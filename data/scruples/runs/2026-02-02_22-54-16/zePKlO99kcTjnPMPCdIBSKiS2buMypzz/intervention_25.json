That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband gave in to his wife's requests during her pregnancy, but after the baby was born, he's going back to their old ways, and she's still expecting him to follow those changes.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the examples he gave. He stopped using the upstairs bathroom because she didn't like the smell during pregnancy. Now he thinks it's unfair because everyone's bathroom smells. Then there's the TV control issue; he let her watch whatever she wanted because she was pregnant, but now he wants to reclaim control. Also, he used to take out food for her during pregnancy, which is expensive, and he's not willing to do that anymore now.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A for yes (he's wrong) and B for no (he's not wrong).\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, compromise is key. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to make adjustments due to the physical and emotional stress of the pregnancy. But postpartum, the husband is feeling that some of those accommodations are no longer necessary. However, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum changes, both physical and emotional. She might be experiencing fatigue, hormonal shifts, or stress, which could make her cling to those habits for comfort or necessity.\n\nThe bathroom issue: During pregnancy, heightened sense of smell is common, so the smell might have been unbearable. After birth, maybe she's still sensitive or dealing with postpartum issues that affect her perception. The husband might think it's just a normal smell now, but she might not be able to handle it. Insulting her by not respecting that could be seen as dismissive.\n\nTV control: During pregnancy, she had more time on her hands. Postpartum, she might be dealing with a new baby, which is tiring. Watching TV might be her way of decompressing. Taking that away could add stress. Maybe she's not just being lazy, but needs that time to recharge.\n\nFood issue: Running out for takeout was a physical accommodation for her during pregnancy. Now, with the baby, maybe she's too exhausted to cook. The budget is a valid concern, but if she's struggling with postpartum fatigue, making her cook could be unreasonable. The husband needs to consider her current state, not just revert to the pre-pregnancy norm.\n\nBut the husband's point is that he's trying to return to normal. The problem is that the wife hasn't adjusted her expectations. He might feel that he's been accommodating for too long and now wants his life back. However, the postpartum period is a time when the mother might need more support. The husband's actions could be seen as not recognizing her ongoing needs, especially if she's still dealing with the aftermath of childbirth.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband did make sacrifices during pregnancy. But postpartum, the dynamic changes. The wife might be struggling with the transition and the new responsibilities, leading her to hold onto those accommodations. If the husband is now reverting without considering how she's feeling, that could be hurtful. He might need to communicate better and find a middle ground rather than going back to old ways abruptly.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If he's being dismissive of her postpartum needs, then yes. If he's trying to balance practical concerns (budget, normalcy) while also supporting her as best as he can, then maybe not. But the way he's framing it as \"she's wrong to still want these things\" could come off as not empathizing with her postpartum experience.\n\nThe answer could lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering her ongoing needs, but maybe B (not in the wrong) if he's just trying to balance things. The key is whether he's being disrespectful or not. The examples he gave (calling her poop smelly, taking away TV, stopping takeout) might be seen as undermining her, especially if she's still dealing with postpartum challenges. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
