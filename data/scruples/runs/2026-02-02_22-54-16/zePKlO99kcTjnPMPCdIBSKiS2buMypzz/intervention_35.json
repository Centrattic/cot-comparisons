Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author changing their behavior back to normal after their wife gave birth, but the wife is still expecting them to follow the same rules they had during pregnancy.\n\nFirst, the author made accommodations during pregnancy, which is understandable. Pregnancy can be physically and emotionally challenging, so it's common for partners to adjust their habits out of support. The key point here is the transition back to normal after the baby is born. The wife is still insisting on those changes, which the author feels are unreasonable now.\n\nLooking at the examples: not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell is one. The author argues that the smell is a normal part of bathroom use and that the wife's request was unnecessary after the pregnancy. The other example is about control of the TV and takeout food. The author feels these are burdens on the budget and their time, especially since they take over baby duties.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for reverting to their old ways. On one hand, the author had been making sacrifices during a difficult time for the wife. On the other hand, after the baby is born and the immediate needs of pregnancy are over, the author is trying to readjust their lifestyle. The wife's continued insistence might be seen as not acknowledging the author's perspective, especially when the reasons for the original accommodations (like the smell being too much for a pregnant woman) no longer apply.\n\nIt's important to consider mutual respect and communication. The author might feel that their boundaries are being ignored, while the wife might feel that her needs during a stressful time are still valid. However, the post suggests that the author is trying to maintain a balance by taking over baby duties, which shows consideration. The issue seems to be about adjusting expectations post-pregnancy. \n\nIn this context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to return to their normal habits, especially if the reasons for the changes are no longer present. The wife's expectations might be unrealistic if they don't account for the postpartum adjustment period. However, this is a nuanced situation where both parties might need to communicate better. But based on the information given, the author's actions seem reasonable.\n"
