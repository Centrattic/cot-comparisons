I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband made a lot of concessions during his wife's pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now that the baby was born, he's trying to go back to normal, but the wife is still expecting those changes. The husband feels it's unfair and hurting the budget, like with takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to make adjustments to support the pregnant person's comfort and health. The husband did that, which seems reasonable. After the birth, he's trying to return to their previous routines. The wife still expects some of those changes, which might be because she's adjusting to postpartum life, dealing with a newborn, or maybe still experiencing some physical discomfort. \n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and communication. The husband feels like the rules shouldn't apply anymore, but the wife might still need them. However, the husband's frustration about the budget and his own habits is valid. The examples he gives\u2014like avoiding the upstairs bathroom because the smell was too much during pregnancy\u2014might not be a big deal for him, but if the wife is still sensitive, maybe she's dealing with postpartum issues like fatigue or lack of energy to clean. \n\nI should consider if there's a middle ground. For instance, maybe the husband can use the upstairs bathroom but clean it more often, or they can discuss the takeout budget. The problem might be that the husband is reverting too quickly without considering that both of them are adjusting to life with a newborn. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband did make those concessions specifically during pregnancy, which is a temporary state. After birth, it's reasonable to expect that things might return to normal, especially if the wife's medical reasons for needing those changes have passed. However, postpartum recovery can vary, and some women might need continued support. \n\nThe husband's examples include things that were for her comfort during pregnancy. If she's still expecting him to follow those rules without a medical reason, maybe that's where the conflict lies. The husband is right that her stool does smell, and it's normal, so not using the bathroom is a bit absurd. Control of the TV might be more about her needing downtime, and takeout is a financial issue. \n\nThe main question is whether the husband is being unreasonable by stopping these concessions. If the wife is still in a vulnerable state postpartum, maybe the husband should show more understanding. However, if the changes were only needed during pregnancy, the husband isn't wrong to expect them to end. The answer might depend on the wife's current health and needs. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the author is the husband, the answer could hinge on whether the wife's continued demands are reasonable. \n\nIn many cases, communication is key. The husband might not be in the wrong if these changes were time-limited, but if the wife is still struggling postpartum, he might need to adjust again. However, the examples given (like bathroom smell) don't seem health-related, so the husband's frustration is valid. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because the concessions were specific to pregnancy, which has ended.\n"
