Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who adjusted his behavior during his wife's pregnancy but now feels she's still insisting on those changes postpartum. He gives examples like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. He made accommodations during pregnancy, which is common and considerate. After the baby was born, he's trying to return to their normal routine, but she's still expecting the same changes. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to revert to old ways.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that the accommodations were temporary due to her pregnancy symptoms. Now that the baby is here, he feels those changes are no longer necessary and are unfair. The wife, on the other hand, might still need some adjustments postpartum, especially with the added stress of caring for a newborn. \n\nBut the examples given: the bathroom smell. He's saying he's okay with it during pregnancy but now finds it insulting. That could be seen as dismissive of her needs. The TV control and takeout might be about shared responsibilities. Maybe she's still dealing with postpartum recovery and fatigue, so relying on him for certain things makes sense. However, the budget issue is a valid concern.\n\nIt's possible the husband is justified in wanting to adjust, but the way he's communicating it might be part of the problem. The key is whether the wife's continued requests are reasonable. If she's still dealing with postpartum issues, some accommodations might still be needed. But if she's just being stubborn, the husband isn't wrong. However, the examples might not be extreme, and the husband's tone could be coming off as dismissive. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong, because he's not considering her possible ongoing needs postpartum. Or B, because he's trying to return to normal and it's reasonable. Need to consider cultural norms and typical postpartum support. Usually, support continues for some time. If he's reverting too quickly without considering her needs, he's in the wrong. The examples like bathroom smell might be a sensitive issue, and the husband's reaction could be seen as insensitive. So likely A.\n"
