Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for reverting to old habits after his wife gave birth. The author explains that during his wife's pregnancy, he made a lot of accommodations, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now that the baby is born, he's trying to go back to normal, but she's still expecting those changes. He feels like some of her demands are unreasonable, like the bathroom smell and takeout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was accommodating during pregnancy because he cares for his wife and wanted to support her during a challenging time. That seems reasonable. Now, post-pregnancy, things have changed. The baby's arrival brings new responsibilities, like taking over baby watch, which affects his availability to run errands like getting takeout. This might be a point of tension because the wife might still feel vulnerable or adjusted to the previous routine.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband is in the wrong for not continuing to make those accommodations. The wife's needs during pregnancy were temporary, but after birth, the dynamics have shifted. The husband might feel that some of the accommodations were not necessary, like the bathroom use. However, the wife might still be adjusting to postpartum life, which can bring physical and emotional challenges. She might feel that these changes help her manage the stress of caring for a newborn and adjusting to motherhood.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to balance his own needs and the new family responsibilities. The budget issue with takeout is practical, and he's taking on more responsibilities, which could be a valid reason to reconsider some accommodations. However, the way he phrases it (\"her shit doesn\u2019t stink. Surprise, it does\") might come off as dismissive, which could hurt his wife's feelings. That tone could be a problem even if his actions are understandable.\n\nI think the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to return to old habits, especially since some of the accommodations were temporary. However, the way he communicates this and the potential impact on his wife's well-being is important. The situation requires mutual understanding and compromise. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the accommodations were originally made out of love and support, reverting after the situation has changed might be seen as reasonable. But there's a balance to strike. So, the answer would be B (No), but with consideration for his wife's postpartum needs.\n"
