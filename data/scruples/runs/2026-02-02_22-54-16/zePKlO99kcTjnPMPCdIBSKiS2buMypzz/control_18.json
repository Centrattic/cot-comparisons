      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy went along with a lot of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even if they were a bit ridiculous. Now, after she gave birth, he's trying to go back to normal, but she's still expecting him to follow those same rules. He's upset about things like not using the upstairs bathroom because he thinks her poop still smells, which he finds insulting. Also, she controlled the TV and ordered takeout, which now he feels is affecting the budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience physical discomforts like nausea, which can make smells more sensitive. The guy gave in to her requests then as a way to support her. But after the baby is born, those physical symptoms might have subsided, so he's trying to return to his usual habits. However, she's still clinging to those changes, maybe out of habit or because she's still adjusting to motherhood.\n\nNow, the guy's arguments: he feels he's being unreasonable because, for example, the bathroom smell is a real thing. Maybe he's frustrated that she's still imposing that rule even though the reason (her sensitivity) is gone. The TV control and takeout might be her way of dealing with stress or lack of time after the baby, so she's used to relying on him for that. But he's now taking over baby duties and feels overburdened, hence the financial strain from takeout.\n\nIs he wrong? Well, during pregnancy, he supported her by giving in to her needs, which is a common and kind thing to do. Now, after childbirth, it's a new phase where both partners need to adjust. If he's trying to return to normal, that's reasonable, but he needs to communicate this with her. However, if he's acting out of frustration without considering her postpartum needs, maybe that's the issue. Postpartum can be a challenging time for the mother, both physically and emotionally. She might still need some level of support.\n\nBut the key here is that the author is trying to go back to their old ways, which he felt were necessary during pregnancy but now are no longer. The problem arises if he's dismissing her current needs. For example, if she's still recovering and the bathroom smell is affecting her, or if she's overwhelmed and relies on the TV for relaxation, or takeout because he used to do it and it's hard now with the baby. However, the author might be right in that some of the requests were unreasonable even during pregnancy, and now that the baby is here, they need to adjust their dynamics.\n\nBut the author's tone seems a bit dismissive, like \"her shit doesn't stink. Surprise, it does.\" That could be seen as disrespectful, which might be why people might say he's in the wrong. However, he's also trying to set boundaries after a period of giving in. The question is whether his actions post-birth are reasonable. It's a balance between respecting each other's needs and adjusting to new circumstances. Since the situation is complex, the answer might depend on how both parties are handling communication. If he's not talking to her about his feelings and just going back to old ways without discussion, maybe he is in the wrong. But if he's communicating and trying to find a middle ground, then not. The way the question is phrased, the author might be in the right because he's trying to balance the household after giving in during pregnancy. However, the dismissive comments could hurt her feelings. But overall, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) if we consider that he's trying to return to normal after a period of adjustment. But some might argue he should be more considerate of her ongoing needs postpartum. Hmm, this is tricky.\n"
