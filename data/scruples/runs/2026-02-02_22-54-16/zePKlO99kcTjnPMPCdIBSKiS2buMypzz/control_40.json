Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The author wrote that during pregnancy, he gave in to a lot of her requests, like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her watch TV, and taking out orders. Now that the baby is here, he's returning to normal, but she's still expecting those accommodations. He feels it's unfair now that the pregnancy is over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can cause physical and emotional changes, and partners often adjust their behavior to support the pregnant person. It's common to make temporary changes to ensure comfort. But after birth, those changes might not be necessary anymore. The author is trying to return to his usual habits, which seems reasonable. However, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum changes or stress, so maybe she's not ready to stop some of the accommodations yet.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author might not be in the wrong if he's expressing his needs now, but he should approach it with empathy. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The examples given\u2014like the bathroom smell\u2014are practical issues. The author might feel that the smell is a real problem, and the wife's previous request was due to her pregnancy. Now that she's not pregnant, he's justified in not following through. Similarly, the TV and takeout are about his own time and budget. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the new baby. The wife might still need his support in other ways, even if not the same as during pregnancy. The author taking over baby watch while working and managing takeout could be seen as balancing responsibilities. However, expecting the wife to adjust postpartum might be a challenge. \n\nIt's possible the author is in the right because the initial changes were temporary. On the other hand, if the wife is still struggling, he might need to find a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be B (No) because returning to normal after pregnancy is reasonable, but it's important to handle it with care and communication.\n"
