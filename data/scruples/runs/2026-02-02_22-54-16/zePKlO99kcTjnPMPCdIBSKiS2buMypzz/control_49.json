That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that after his wife gave birth, he's going back to old habits, but she's still expecting the changes he made during her pregnancy. The author is frustrated because things like not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out takeout for her are causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many people experience physical discomfort, like nausea, which can make certain smells or situations unbearable. The husband adjusted to accommodate that, which is common and kind. Now, after the baby's birth, he's trying to return to normal routines, but the wife is still expecting those accommodations. She might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, which can include physical and emotional challenges. The bathroom issue: if she's still sensitive, maybe she's avoiding using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell, or maybe she's dealing with postpartum fatigue or depression. The husband's comment about the smell being insulting suggests he's dismissing her needs, which could be hurtful.\n\nFor the TV control, during pregnancy, she had limited mobility or energy, so TV time might have been important for her. Now, with the baby, she might still need downtime. The husband taking over baby watch when he gets home means she might not have time to relax, so she relies on him to take care of her needs. If he's not willing to continue helping with takeout, it could be adding stress to her.\n\nFinancially, takeout might not be the best for the budget, but if the wife is struggling with postpartum, maybe she needs comfort food to cope. The husband's frustration about the budget is valid, but it's a balance between financial responsibility and emotional support.\n\nThe key here is communication. The husband might feel he's doing the right thing by adjusting his behavior during pregnancy but not after, but the wife might feel that her needs are still valid. The husband's tone, like calling her stool smell \"insulting\" and the takeout being a financial burden, could come off as dismissive. It's possible that the wife is still experiencing challenges postpartum that require some adjustments beyond the pregnancy period.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? He's not entirely wrong because it's reasonable to expect that some accommodations are temporary. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014without considering her ongoing needs and communicating openly\u2014might be the issue. The wife's perspective is that she's still adjusting, and maybe the husband isn't being as supportive as before. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the husband being in the wrong because he's not maintaining the support she needs postpartum, even if some changes are no longer necessary due to her condition. Alternatively, if the accommodations were only for pregnancy, he's justified in reverting. But the problem is that she's still expecting them, which might not be fair. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. I need to weigh both sides but consider that postpartum can be a different phase where some needs persist. The husband's frustration is understandable, but his approach might be dismissive. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
