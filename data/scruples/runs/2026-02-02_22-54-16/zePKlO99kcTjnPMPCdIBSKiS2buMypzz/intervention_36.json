Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the husband made a lot of accommodations during his wife's pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Now, after she gave birth, he's reverting to his old habits, but the wife is still expecting those changes to continue. The husband feels it's unfair now that the pregnancy is over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's saying he did all these things out of love and consideration during the pregnancy, even if some requests were unreasonable. Now he's trying to return to their normal routine, which makes sense because the temporary situation (pregnancy) is over. The examples given\u2014like the bathroom smell and ordering takeout\u2014are things that might be more about personal habits and financial concerns. He feels it's unreasonable to continue these accommodations post-birth.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, which can be physically and emotionally challenging. She might feel that some accommodations help her manage the stress of caring for a newborn. Communication is key here. The husband is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable, especially if the demands are affecting their budget or his well-being. However, he might need to approach this with empathy, understanding that the wife's needs might still be adjusted due to the new responsibilities of motherhood.\n\nThe core issue is about mutual respect and communication. The husband isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to revert to old habits, but he needs to talk to his wife and find a middle ground. If he's abrupt or dismissive, that could be problematic. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not continuing the accommodations. Since the pregnancy is over, it's understandable he wants to return to normal, but the way he's expressing it\u2014calling her requests \"insulting\"\u2014might not be the best approach. The answer hinges on whether his actions are within reason given the circumstances and how they communicate.\n"
