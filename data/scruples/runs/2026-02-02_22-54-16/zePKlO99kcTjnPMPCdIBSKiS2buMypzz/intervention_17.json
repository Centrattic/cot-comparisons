I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The user is asking if the person who wrote this (AITA) is wrong for going back to old ways after their wife gave birth. The author mentions that during the pregnancy, they gave into a lot of the wife's requests, even if some were ridiculous. Now, after the baby was born, the author is trying to go back to the old normal, but the wife is still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, giving up control of the TV, and taking out food orders.\n\nFirst, I should consider what's normal in such situations. Pregnancy can cause physical discomfort and emotional changes, so it's common for partners to accommodate certain requests. Postpartum is also a time when the new mother might be dealing with recovery, sleep deprivation, and hormonal changes. However, the author is now saying that some of these accommodations are no longer necessary, like the bathroom smell. The wife's insistence on these things might be leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points are: the author made accommodations during pregnancy, which is understandable. Now, the author wants to return to their previous habits, but the wife is still enforcing those changes. The author feels that some requests are unreasonable now, like the bathroom issue. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants to know if others agree.\n\nI should consider the balance between respecting the wife's needs and the author's own needs. It's possible that the wife is still dealing with postpartum issues and might need some adjustments, even if they seem trivial. On the other hand, the author is concerned about their own comfort and the financial impact of takeout. The bathroom issue is a bit strange\u2014maybe the wife found the smell during pregnancy but not now? Or maybe she's still sensitive? The TV and takeout are about control and habits. The author is trying to reclaim some normalcy, which is valid. However, the wife might feel that these changes were necessary for her well-being during pregnancy, and now she's expecting them to continue for her adjustment postpartum.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might need to discuss this with their wife, explaining their perspective and understanding hers. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing frustration, which is normal. However, if the changes were reasonable during pregnancy, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to continue them postpartum. However, if the wife is still struggling with postpartum depression or anxiety, maybe some adjustments are needed. But the examples given seem more like habits than necessary accommodations.\n\nSo, the author's position is that they were accommodating but now feel it's unreasonable. The wife's insistence might be causing tension. The author is not being cruel, just trying to return to their old life. I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to expect some return to their normal life after pregnancy, and the wife might need to adjust her expectations. However, this is a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points. The author is expressing their feelings, and it's important to address this through communication rather than judging right or wrong. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the examples given don't seem malicious, the answer is probably B.\n"
