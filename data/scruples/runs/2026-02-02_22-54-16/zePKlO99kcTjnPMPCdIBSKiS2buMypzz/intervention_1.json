Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author made changes during his wife's pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and giving her control of the TV, but after the baby was born, he's going back to normal. The wife is still expecting those changes, but he's pushing back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says he's not being unreasonable. He's just trying to return to their old ways. He mentions things like the bathroom smell, which he now thinks is insulting. The TV thing: he allowed her to control it during pregnancy because she was confined, but now she's not. Also, the takeout thing is affecting the budget.\n\nFrom his perspective, he's adjusting back to life post-pregnancy. He's doing his share by taking over baby duty. But the wife is still expecting those accommodations. Is it fair for her to keep those up after the pregnancy is over? Pregnancy and postpartum are different, but maybe she's still dealing with recovery, fatigue, or other issues. Maybe the changes weren't just for her comfort during pregnancy but for her health or recovery.\n\nBut the author feels it's going too far now. The bathroom smell example: maybe during pregnancy, she was more sensitive to smells, so avoiding the upstairs bathroom was a temporary measure. Now, he's saying it's just normal, but she might still be dealing with postpartum issues or the stress of caring for a newborn. The TV control: during pregnancy, she couldn't do much else, so the TV was her entertainment. Now, maybe she's still using it as a way to unwind after caring for the baby.\n\nThe takeout issue: maybe she's struggling with postpartum fatigue and finds it hard to cook. The author is concerned about the budget, but maybe she's not in a position to cook. It's a balance between financial responsibility and her well-being.\n\nThe author might be right to want to adjust back to their normal, but the wife's perspective is also important. If the wife is still in need of those accommodations, pushing back could be seen as not supporting her. On the other hand, if those were temporary changes, the author isn't wrong to expect them to revert.\n\nBut the key here is communication. Did they talk about these expectations? If the author didn't ask her why she still wanted those things, maybe he's not in the wrong, but it's possible he's not considering her ongoing needs. The question is whether he's being unreasonable by not continuing the changes that were made during a specific time period. The wife might be struggling, and him not continuing could add stress.\n\nI think the author's intentions are good\u2014he's trying to maintain his usual habits and help with the baby. But if the wife is still in need, his pushback might be causing her unnecessary stress. However, the original changes were made during pregnancy, which is a temporary state. So maybe it's reasonable to expect them to return. The answer depends on whether the wife's needs are still valid postpartum. If they are, then the author might be in the wrong. If not, then he's justified.\n\nBut the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe because the changes were specific to pregnancy, which is over. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to be careful. It's a balance between empathy and practicality.\n"
