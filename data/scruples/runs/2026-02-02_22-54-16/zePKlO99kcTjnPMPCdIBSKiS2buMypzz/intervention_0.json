Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he gave in to his wife's requests, even if they were \"ridiculous.\" Now, after the baby was born, he's reverting to their old habits, and the wife is still expecting those changes to stay.\n\nSo, the key points here are: During pregnancy, the husband made accommodations, but postpartum, he's pushing back. The examples given are using the upstairs bathroom, TV control, and takeout. The husband feels that some of these were unreasonable and that he shouldn't have to continue them. The wife, on the other hand, seems to still want those changes enforced.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can bring about physical and emotional changes, and sometimes women experience nausea or heightened sensitivities. Letting a pregnant partner avoid certain smells or have more control over their environment can be about comfort and health. However, after birth, the husband feels that these accommodations are no longer necessary. \n\nThe husband's argument is that he's not in the wrong because he tried to be accommodating when it was needed (during pregnancy) but now that the baby is born, he's returning to normal. The wife might feel that her needs during pregnancy were valid, but maybe she's not considering that those were temporary. \n\nBut wait, postpartum is also a time when new mothers can experience stress, physical recovery, and adjusting to the baby's schedule. If the husband is reverting to old habits, maybe the wife is struggling with the transition. However, the husband is also dealing with the new responsibilities of parenthood and the financial strain of takeout.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for going back. It seems like he's acting within his rights to adjust once the temporary situation (pregnancy) has passed. However, communication is key here. Both parties should be discussing their needs. The husband is expressing his feelings of being taken advantage of, which is understandable. The wife might need to acknowledge that the temporary changes were specific to her pregnancy and that postpartum, they need to find a balance. \n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? If he made a conscious effort to accommodate her during a time when it was medically or emotionally necessary, and now is trying to restore normalcy, that might be reasonable. However, if the wife is still in a vulnerable postpartum period, being abrupt about it could be hurtful. But the husband isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially if those accommodations were not necessary anymore. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The main issue is whether the husband is wrong for not continuing the temporary measures. Since the accommodations were during pregnancy and not postpartum, reverting makes sense. So, the answer should be B.\n"
