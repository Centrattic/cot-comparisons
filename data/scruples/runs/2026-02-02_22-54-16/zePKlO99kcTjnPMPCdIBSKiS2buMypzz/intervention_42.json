I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a husband who went along with his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even some he found ridiculous. Now that the baby was born in October, he's going back to their old ways, but the wife is still expecting those changes. The examples given are avoiding the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out takeout for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, it's common for partners to make accommodations because pregnancy can be physically and emotionally challenging. The husband did that, showing flexibility and care. After the birth, the wife might still be recovering, dealing with postpartum issues, or adjusting to life with a newborn. It's possible she's still sensitive or has lingering needs from pregnancy.\n\nThe husband's frustration is understandable. He might feel that the accommodations were temporary and now wants to return to normal family routines. However, the wife might see these as necessary adjustments that continue to help her manage the stress or physical demands of postpartum life. The bathroom issue: maybe the smell is still bothering her after giving birth, or she's dealing with postpartum recovery where smells are more sensitive. The TV control could be because she's dealing with the new baby and wants some mental respite. Takeout might be about energy levels or time management with a newborn, making it hard to cook.\n\nThe key here is communication. If the husband hasn't discussed these changes with his wife and simply reverted to old ways, that could be an issue. The wife might feel her needs are being dismissed, especially if she's still adjusting. On the other hand, the husband has valid points about the budget and personal space. But is he in the wrong? It depends on whether he considered her ongoing needs and communicated his concerns. If he just assumed she no longer needed those changes without talking to her, he might be overstepping. But if he's trying to find a balance and the wife is being unreasonable, he's in the right.\n\nThe examples given don't show that the wife is being irrational postpartum, just that she's continuing what was done during pregnancy. The husband's actions could be seen as reverting without considering her current state. So maybe the husband is not entirely in the wrong, but the situation needs mutual understanding and discussion. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to resume normalcy and the wife is resisting, perhaps the answer is B (No), but with the caveat that both need to communicate better.\n"
