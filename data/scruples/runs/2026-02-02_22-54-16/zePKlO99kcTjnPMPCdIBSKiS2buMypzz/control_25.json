Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The setup is that the author went back to their old ways after the baby was born, but the wife is still expecting the same changes they had during her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the specific examples. The wife asked not to use the upstairs bathroom because the smell was too much during her pregnancy. Now, the author is going back to using it, which he finds insulting. The wife might have had a valid reason during pregnancy, but postpartum, maybe she's still sensitive or there's another issue. But the author feels it's unreasonable now.\n\nThen there's the TV control. During pregnancy, he let her watch trashy reality shows because she couldn't do much else. Now he wants to take over the TV when he gets home. It's about shared space and time. Maybe the wife is still adjusting to her new role as a mother and the TV is her way of decompressing.\n\nFood is another issue. The author was getting takeout for the wife during pregnancy, but now it's affecting the budget. He feels he shouldn't have to do that anymore. The wife might be used to that routine and finds it hard to ask for food now, especially with a newborn.\n\nThe key here is understanding the postpartum period. After giving birth, women often experience physical and emotional changes. The wife might still be dealing with postpartum depression, anxiety, or fatigue. The author might be returning to old habits too quickly without considering that she might still need support. The line \"Like her shit doesn't stink. Surprise, it does.\" is dismissive and could be hurtful. It's important to approach this with empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to balance the household budget and his own needs. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's needs postpartum are significant. The author might not be considering that some accommodations during pregnancy have lingering effects. For example, maybe the smell of the bathroom is still a trigger, even if it's not the same as before. Or the wife might be overwhelmed with the baby and needs the TV as a coping mechanism.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not have addressed this with his wife, assuming she should just let go, but the wife might need more time or support. The answer hinges on whether the author is being dismissive of her ongoing needs versus trying to return to a balanced household. Since the author is being critical and not showing empathy, it's possible he's in the wrong. But there's also the aspect of shared responsibility. The wife might need to adjust as well. However, the tone of the examples suggests the author is not being understanding, which could make him at fault.\n"
