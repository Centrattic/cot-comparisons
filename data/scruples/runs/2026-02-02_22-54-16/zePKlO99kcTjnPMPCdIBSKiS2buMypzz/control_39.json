I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband gave in to a lot of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even if they were ridiculous. Now that the baby is born, he's reverting to his old habits, and the wife is still expecting the same changes. The husband feels like the wife is being unreasonable now.\n\nExamples given include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and buying takeout food. The husband thinks these were temporary accommodations during pregnancy but the wife still wants them continued postpartum. He's frustrated that these things are affecting his comfort and the budget.\n\nNow, I need to consider if he's wrong. The key here is understanding the dynamics of their relationship and the transition period after childbirth. During pregnancy, hormonal changes and physical discomfort can make a woman more sensitive to smells, fatigue, etc. The husband was making sacrifices to support her during that time. Now, postpartum, the wife might still be dealing with recovery, sleep deprivation, and the stress of a new baby. Her expecting some accommodations to continue could be due to ongoing needs, not just stubbornness.\n\nThe husband is returning to his old ways, which might be seen as not considering his wife's continued needs. The bathroom issue\u2014maybe the smell is a real issue for her, especially if she's recovering and more sensitive. The TV control might be because she's overwhelmed with the baby and needs downtime. Takeout could be because she's not up for cooking after giving birth, even if it's not as necessary as during pregnancy.\n\nBut the husband does have valid points too. He's working extra hours, the budget is tight, and he wants to reclaim some of his old habits. The balance here is tricky. The question is about whether his actions are in the wrong. From a general perspective, supporting a spouse during pregnancy and postpartum is important, but there's also the aspect of mutual respect and communication. If the husband didn't communicate his feelings and just reverted, that could be problematic. However, if the wife isn't acknowledging his efforts and the financial strain, that's another side.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. The husband might be wrong if he's dismissing his wife's legitimate needs without discussion. But if the wife is holding onto unreasonable demands without considering his perspective, that could also be an issue. However, the husband's actions seem to be the trigger here. He's the one who changed his behavior postpartum without considering that some adjustments might still be necessary, leading to conflict. So, the answer might be that he is in the wrong because he's reverting without understanding if those changes were still needed for his wife's well-being. Alternatively, maybe not, because he's also trying to return to a normal life.\n\nBut the key is that the wife was asking for these changes during pregnancy, and the husband complied. Now that the baby is here, the wife's needs might still be significant, especially postpartum. The husband's frustration is valid, but so is the wife's need for support. The problem is that he's not addressing this with her but just going back to old ways. In that case, he's in the wrong because he's not communicating and considering her ongoing needs. So, answer A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
