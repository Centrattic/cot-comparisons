I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the husband) is in the wrong for going back to his old ways after his wife gave birth. The situation is that during pregnancy, he gave in to her requests, but now that the baby was born, he's reverting and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, it's common for women to experience nausea, especially in the first trimester. The husband not using the upstairs bathroom was probably to avoid any unpleasant smells that could trigger her nausea. After birth, maybe the smell isn't as bad, but the wife might have become used to that arrangement and now sees it as something she's entitled to, even if it's not necessary anymore. \n\nThe control of the TV: during pregnancy, maybe she had less energy or mobility, so he let her have it. Now, postpartum, she might still be adjusting, dealing with new responsibilities, and the TV is a comfort. But he's frustrated because he's taking over baby duty and expects her to manage her own entertainment. \n\nFood is another issue. She got used to takeout during pregnancy, which is common because of nausea and possible appetite changes. Now, postpartum, maybe she's still recovering, and buying takeout helps her rest. The husband is concerned about the budget, which is valid, but she might be relying on that as a way to manage energy and time with a newborn.\n\nThe husband might feel he's being unreasonable, thinking she's overstepping, but the wife might feel her needs are still valid postpartum. The key here is the shift from pregnancy accommodations to postpartum adjustments. \n\nIs the husband wrong for reverting? Well, pregnancy and postpartum are different phases. What was necessary during pregnancy might not be during postpartum, but the wife might still expect some level of consideration. The husband's frustration is understandable, especially with the added stress of a new baby. However, expecting her to go back to exactly how things were before pregnancy might be unreasonable given the physical and emotional challenges of postpartum. \n\nThe wife might be struggling with the transition and feeling overwhelmed. The husband's actions could be seen as dismissive of her ongoing needs. But the husband is also managing the baby's care and financial concerns, which are valid too. \n\nIt's a balance of mutual respect and understanding. The husband might not be entirely in the wrong, but he could be missing the point of why she's still expecting those changes. It's possible that the wife needs support beyond pregnancy, and the husband needs to communicate his feelings without being dismissive. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards the husband not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife is still in a vulnerable postpartum state, expecting some accommodations is reasonable. But if the husband is just reverting without considering her ongoing needs, that could be the issue. The examples given (bathroom smell, TV, food) might be trivial, but they could also be symptoms of deeper issues. The husband's frustration is valid, but his approach might be lacking empathy.\n"
