Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who, during his wife's pregnancy, complied with many of her requests, even some he found ridiculous. After she gave birth, he went back to their old ways, but she's still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband was accommodating during pregnancy, which is common and often expected. Pregnancy can bring physical discomfort and mood changes, so giving in to requests is usually seen as supportive. Postpartum, the husband wants to revert to normal habits. The wife is still expecting those changes, which might be due to postpartum adjustments or lingering pregnancy-related issues.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the husband isn't doing anything to harm her. The requests during pregnancy were temporary, so ending them after birth isn't inherently wrong. However, the wife's continued insistence might stem from postpartum challenges. The husband's actions are about restoring his own comfort and the household's normalcy. The financial aspect of takeout is also a valid concern.\n\nBut does that make him right? Well, communication is key here. The husband might be within his rights to stop accommodating, but the way he's expressing it (calling her stool smelly, not respecting her) could be part of the problem. The wife might need support postpartum, which includes some adjustments. However, the husband isn't wrong for wanting to return to their original routines after the temporary pregnancy period. The core issue is mutual understanding and adjusting expectations post-birth.\n\nIn many cases, people expect that temporary accommodations during pregnancy don't extend indefinitely. The husband's actions are about reclaiming his own habits, which isn't unethical. However, the situation could be improved with better dialogue between both parties. But based on the question of right or wrong, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for reverting to old ways after a temporary period of adjustment.\n"
