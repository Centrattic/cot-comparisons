Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who gave in to his wife's requests during her pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom and doing takeout, but now after the baby was born, he's going back to his old ways. The wife is still expecting those changes, but he feels it's unreasonable now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, hormonal changes and physical discomfort can make women more sensitive to smells or need more rest. The husband was accommodating then, which is common and caring. Now, the baby's here, and the wife might still be dealing with postpartum changes. Maybe the bathroom issue isn't just about smell but something else, like hygiene or stress. The husband is frustrated because he's reverting, but the wife wants those accommodations to continue or until she's ready to let go.\n\nThe examples given: the bathroom, TV control, and takeout. The husband thinks the smell shouldn't matter, but maybe she's still sensitive. The TV control was about her having nothing else to do during pregnancy; now, with a baby, maybe she's still overwhelmed and needs downtime. Food is a budget issue, but takeout might be a way for her to get rest, not just a luxury.\n\nThe key here is understanding that postpartum is a critical time. New mothers often experience physical and emotional challenges. The husband's frustration is valid, but expecting her to drop all the accommodations immediately might not consider her needs. Communication is key here. If he didn't discuss this with her, just went back to old ways, that could be the issue. Maybe he should have talked about the budget and found solutions together. Also, the wife's insistence might be about feeling supported, not just stubbornness.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From an outsider's view, if he suddenly stops all support without discussing it, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the wife is being unreasonable and not listening to his side, that's another angle. However, in these situations, the general advice is to prioritize the partner's well-being during postpartum, as it's a vulnerable time. So the husband's actions might be seen as selfish if he's not considering her ongoing needs. So the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he's reverting without considering her possible ongoing needs postpartum and not communicating properly.\n"
