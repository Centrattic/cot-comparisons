I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after going back to old habits after his wife gave birth. The situation involves him accommodating her during pregnancy but now not wanting to continue some of those accommodations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wife wanted certain things during pregnancy, like not using the upstairs bathroom, control of the TV, and takeout food. The husband complied during pregnancy but now, postpartum, he's reverting and there's conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. So, the user thinks he's not in the wrong and wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nDuring pregnancy, the husband gave in to the wife's requests, which he found ridiculous but did anyway. Now, after the baby was born in October, he's trying to go back to their old normal. The wife still wants some of those changes continued. The examples given are the bathroom, TV control, and takeout food.\n\nThe husband's reasoning: The bathroom smell is normal, so he shouldn't have to avoid it. The TV control was because she was pregnant and had limited activities, but now it's unreasonable. The takeout is expensive and he's the one handling baby duty, so he doesn't want to do that anymore.\n\nFrom a general perspective, during pregnancy, many people adjust their habits to make the pregnant partner more comfortable. Postpartum, the adjustments might change. However, the wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery and stress, which can affect her needs. The husband's frustration is understandable, especially with financial and household responsibilities.\n\nThe main issue is communication. The husband might feel that his previous accommodations were temporary and the wife is now not respecting that. The wife might feel that some needs are still valid post-birth, especially if she's recovering or dealing with the baby's needs. \n\nBut the husband's actions\u2014like using the bathroom, controlling the TV, and not getting takeout\u2014are about returning to their normal. The wife's continued insistence on the old rules could be seen as not considering his perspective. However, the wife might be feeling that her needs are still important, especially postpartum.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The husband is probably not wrong to want to return to their normal life, especially if the wife's requests were based on temporary pregnancy conditions. However, the way he's expressing his frustration (e.g., \"her shit doesn't stink\") might come off as dismissive of her past needs. That could contribute to the conflict.\n\nThe key is whether the husband is being considerate of his wife's postpartum situation. If the wife is experiencing postpartum depression or physical discomfort, her requests might still be valid. But if it's about habits formed during pregnancy that aren't necessary anymore, the husband has a right to set boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong), but it depends on the context. Since the question is straightforward and the user is seeking a yes/no answer, the best fit is B.\n"
