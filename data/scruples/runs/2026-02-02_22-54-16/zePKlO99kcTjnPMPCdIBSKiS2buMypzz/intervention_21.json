Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband who, during his wife's pregnancy, gave in to her requests even when he found them ridiculous. Now that their daughter was born, he's trying to go back to their old ways, but she's still expecting him to follow the same rules. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom because of the smell, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for takeout which he feels is hurting their budget.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. They think he's not, but want my opinion. The options are A for yes (he's in the wrong) or B for no (he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband made accommodations during pregnancy, which is common. Now, postpartum, he's trying to adjust back, but the wife is still holding onto those same expectations. The key here is whether the husband is being unreasonable by reverting to old habits or if the wife is being too controlling.\n\nThe husband's actions seem to be about reclaiming his previous lifestyle. Using the upstairs bathroom is a practical issue; the smell is a natural bodily function, and expecting someone to avoid using a bathroom because of that might be unreasonable. The TV control issue is about shared space and personal freedom. The takeout issue is financial, and he's trying to manage the budget.\n\nHowever, postpartum is a time when the mother might still need support. The wife might be struggling with the transition back to normal routines, especially if she's dealing with the physical and emotional challenges of postpartum recovery. It's possible that the husband's abrupt return to old habits could be seen as dismissive of her needs during this sensitive period. \n\nBut the user argues the husband isn't in the wrong. The husband's perspective is that he made sacrifices during pregnancy, and now he's trying to balance things again. It's about mutual respect and compromise. The wife might need to adjust her expectations, but perhaps the husband could communicate his needs better instead of just reverting without discussion. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If the wife is still expecting the same accommodations postpartum, maybe she's being unreasonable. For example, not using a bathroom because of smell isn't a valid long-term request. Similarly, controlling the TV all the time isn't fair. The takeout issue is about financial responsibility. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of postpartum stress. The wife might be struggling and latching onto these rules as a way to handle the new dynamics. The husband's return to old habits could be seen as not considering her possible ongoing needs. However, the husband did accommodate her during pregnancy, and it's reasonable to expect some mutual adjustment now. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a balance. The husband isn't in the wrong for wanting to resume his previous habits, but he might need to approach the situation with more sensitivity. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong based on the given scenario. The examples he gives do seem like reasonable adjustments for him to make. The wife's continued insistence might be the issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). The husband is trying to adjust postpartum, and the wife's continued demands might be the problem. But I'm a bit conflicted because postpartum can be a time when the mother still needs support. However, the specific examples given by the husband seem like common issues that both partners should negotiate, and he's justified in wanting to address them. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
