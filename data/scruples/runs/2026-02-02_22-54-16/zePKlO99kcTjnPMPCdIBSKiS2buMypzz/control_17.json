Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going back to old ways after his wife gave birth. The author mentions that during pregnancy, he complied with her requests, even if they were unreasonable. Now, post-birth, he's reverting to old habits, and his wife is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. During pregnancy, the author made accommodations to support his wife's health and comfort. It's common for partners to adjust their behavior to help with morning sickness, fatigue, etc. But after the baby is born, those reasons might not exist anymore. The author is now trying to return to normal, but the wife expects those changes to continue.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for stopping those accommodations. The wife might feel that the adjustments are still needed for her recovery or for baby care. The author feels the requests are no longer reasonable. For example, the bathroom issue: during pregnancy, maybe the smell was triggering, but postpartum, maybe the author is expected to maintain the bathroom's cleanliness more, or the smell isn't an issue anymore. The author finds it insulting, but maybe the wife still finds it bothersome. \n\nThe TV and food examples: during pregnancy, the author gave up control of the TV and took on takeout. Post-birth, he's trying to take back those habits. The wife might be adjusting to new routines and relying on these habits for stress relief or time to herself. The author is concerned about the budget and wants to share responsibilities. \n\nI need to consider if the author is overstepping by not continuing the accommodations. However, it's also important to note that during pregnancy, the author adjusted for her comfort, but postpartum, the situation has changed. The wife might not be considering that the author's habits are part of his normal life and that he's trying to balance shared responsibilities. \n\nThere's a balance between mutual respect and shared responsibilities in a marriage. If the wife expects the same level of accommodation without considering the author's perspective, that could be an issue. On the other hand, if the author is dismissing her needs postpartum, that's also a problem. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if reverting to old habits is causing significant stress or harm to the wife's recovery. However, if those accommodations were only necessary during pregnancy and the wife is now capable, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The line here is whether the wife's requests postpartum are still necessary or if they've become unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of communication, maybe the author should discuss with his wife to find a middle ground. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the wife is still needing those accommodations for her well-being, then the author is in the wrong. If the accommodations were only temporary, then he's not. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the accommodations were during pregnancy, which is a temporary state. Postpartum, the reasons for those changes may no longer apply. However, there's a need for open communication. Since the author is trying to return to normal and the wife is struggling with it, maybe the problem is more about communication than the author being wrong. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
