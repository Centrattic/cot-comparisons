Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is asking about whether they're at fault for returning to their old habits after their wife gave birth. They mention that during pregnancy, they accommodated a lot of their wife's requests, even if they seemed ridiculous. Now that the baby is born, they're reverting to the \"old normal,\" but the wife still expects those changes to continue. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many women experience physical and emotional discomforts, which might justify some temporary changes in behavior. For example, not using the upstairs bathroom could be due to pregnancy-related nausea or sensitivity to smells. The author complied then, which shows they were considerate.\n\nAfter birth, the situation might change. The wife might still be dealing with postpartum recovery, fatigue, or other challenges. The author's feelings of being infringed upon, like the bathroom smell, could be valid. However, the wife's perspective might still need special considerations postpartum, perhaps for her health or well-being. \n\nThe TV example: the author let the wife control it during pregnancy, maybe because she couldn't go out much. Now, after birth, maybe the wife is still recovering and needs rest, so controlling the TV might be part of her routine. But the author feels it's unreasonable now. It's a bit of a shift from pregnancy to postpartum, but the wife's needs could still be significant.\n\nFood is another issue. The author is concerned about the budget, as they were often getting takeout. Postpartum, women sometimes have specific dietary needs or lack the energy to cook. The author might be feeling overwhelmed with baby duties and not wanting to take on extra responsibilities. But the wife might still expect support, especially if she's adjusting to new routines and the demands of a newborn.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being inconsiderate by not continuing to support their wife's needs postpartum. While pregnancy is a unique time with its own challenges, postpartum care is equally important. The author might be reverting too quickly without considering that their wife's needs could persist or change. \n\nHowever, the author argues that some of the requests were \"ridiculous,\" so maybe they felt they were overdoing it during pregnancy. But the transition back to normal should be mutual and considerate. Communication is crucial. If the author hasn't discussed this with their wife and is just expecting her to drop the expectations, that's where the problem might be. \n\nThe bathroom issue: the smell was a problem during pregnancy, but now the author is upset. It's possible the wife might still have health issues that make the smell uncomfortable, or maybe she's just not ready to return to the old setup. The author's frustration is understandable, but so is the wife's possible discomfort. \n\nIn terms of takeout, it's a practical concern. The author is right about the budget, but the wife might need that comfort food or not have the energy to cook. The author could be expected to find a middle ground, like cooking together or splitting responsibilities. \n\nOverall, the author's actions might be seen as lessening their support for the wife when she might still need it. While it's natural for life to return to some normalcy, the wife's postpartum period is a critical time where continued support is important. The author might be in the wrong if they're dismissing their wife's ongoing needs without discussion. But if the wife's needs have genuinely changed and the author is trying to adjust while communicating, maybe not. The question is whether the author is being inconsiderate without considering the wife's current situation. Since the postpartum period can be challenging, the author might be in the wrong by not maintaining the support they provided during pregnancy. \n\nBut I need to check if \"old ways\" are entirely unreasonable. The examples given (bathroom, TV, takeout) might not be major issues. The author's frustration is valid, but the wife's perspective is also important. Without communication, the author might be making assumptions. So the answer might be that they are in the wrong (A) because they didn't discuss the changes with their wife and are expecting her to let go of the accommodations that might still be necessary for her well-being.\n"
