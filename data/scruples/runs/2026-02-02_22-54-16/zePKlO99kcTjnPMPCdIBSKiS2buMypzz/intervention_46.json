Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband went along with a lot of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, but after the baby was born, he's reverting to their old ways, and she's still expecting those changes to continue. The examples given are using the upstairs bathroom, letting her control the TV, and taking out orders for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Pregnancy can bring physical and emotional changes, and it's common for partners to make accommodations during that time. The husband did that, which is good. Now, after the baby, maybe the wife is still adjusting or has lingering needs. The wife might feel that some of these changes should stay, perhaps for her well-being or to cope with postpartum challenges.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that things like the bathroom smell are a given and that taking out food is a budget issue. But the wife might see it as her needing support during a stressful time. The key here is communication. Did they discuss why she still needs these things? Maybe she's dealing with postpartum depression or fatigue, and these small comforts are important for her mental health. \n\nThe husband's frustration is understandable, especially the financial aspect. But it's important to balance his needs with hers. If he just goes back to old ways without considering her feelings, that could be hurtful. The question is whether he's being reasonable. If he's not communicating and is dismissing her needs, he might be in the wrong. But if he's trying to find a middle ground, maybe not. \n\nThe examples: The bathroom issue. During pregnancy, she had nausea, so avoiding the smell made sense. Now, maybe she's still sensitive? Or maybe she feels it's her way of controlling something. The TV control\u2014maybe she's still dealing with a lot and wants to relax with shows. The food: postpartum can be a time when women feel they can't do much, so having someone help with meals is a comfort. \n\nThe husband might think these are unreasonable, but from her perspective, they might be necessary. The question is whether he's being inconsiderate by not continuing these accommodations. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for both sides. The husband did make an effort during pregnancy, which is good. But now, if he's just giving up without discussion, that could be the issue. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's not being considerate of her needs postpartum. Or B (not in the wrong) if he's balancing his own needs. \n\nBut I think the key is that after pregnancy, the wife might still have needs, and the husband is reverting without considering that. So he might be in the wrong. But maybe not, if he's communicating and they're finding a middle ground. The examples don't mention communication, so maybe the husband is just assuming she doesn't need it anymore. So answer A.\n"
