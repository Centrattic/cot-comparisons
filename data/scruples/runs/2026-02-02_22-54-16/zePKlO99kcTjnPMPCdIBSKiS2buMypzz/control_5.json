Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband adjusting back to their old routines after their child was born. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband says he gave into many of his wife's requests during her pregnancy, even when they were \"ridiculous.\" Now, post-birth, he's trying to revert to their previous normal, but the wife is still expecting those changes. Examples include not using the upstairs bathroom (because of the smell, which he now finds insulting), letting her control the TV for reality shows, and her relying on him to get takeout, which is hurting the budget.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. I should consider the context. During pregnancy, many people make adjustments for the comfort of the expecting parent. It's common to avoid certain things like strong smells to prevent nausea. After giving birth, the physical changes might still linger, especially if the wife is recovering or dealing with postpartum issues. \n\nThe husband's frustration is understandable, but maybe he's not considering that some of these needs could still be valid. For instance, postpartum depression or anxiety might affect her mental state, making her cling to the comfort she had before. Also, the takeout issue could relate to her still being in a postpartum phase where meal preparation is difficult, physically or due to time constraints. \n\nHe mentions that the smell was insulting, implying he's annoyed. Maybe he should approach it with more empathy, understanding that her body is still recovering. The TV control part: maybe she's had a hard time and needs some mental escape, or perhaps she's still tired and wants to relax. \n\nThe budget issue is a practical concern. However, it's important to find a middle ground. Maybe they can discuss setting a limit on takeout or taking turns with baby watch. The husband's tone seems dismissive, using phrases like \"her shit doesn't stink. Surprise, it does,\" which might come off as insensitive. \n\nI should also consider societal expectations. After childbirth, there's often a period where the mother needs more support. If the husband is suddenly removing all the concessions made during pregnancy, it could add stress to her recovery. The key here is communication and mutual understanding rather than abruptly reverting to old ways. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the examples given are about him not accommodating his wife's ongoing needs postpartum. If she's still experiencing discomfort or needs time to adjust, he should be supportive. His approach seems to be about personal convenience rather than considering her current situation. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not acknowledging her post-birth needs and is being dismissive. However, if the wife is being unreasonable and hasn't discussed the changes with him, maybe B. But based on the info given, it's more about him not being understanding, so AITA would likely be A.\n"
