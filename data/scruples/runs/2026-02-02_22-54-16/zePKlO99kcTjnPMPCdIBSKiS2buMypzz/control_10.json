I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who went back to his old ways after his wife gave birth, and she's still expecting him to follow the changes he made during her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the specific actions he's talking about. He mentions not using the upstairs bathroom, giving her control of the TV, and doing takeout for her. During pregnancy, many people experience nausea and sensitivity to smells, so avoiding the upstairs bathroom might have been a consideration for her comfort. Similarly, being in charge of the TV could be about her needing mental stimulation or something to do while pregnant. The takeout thing might have been a way to accommodate her food preferences or inability to cook, but now it's affecting the budget.\n\nThe husband is frustrated because he's reverting to normal, but the wife still wants those accommodations. He feels it's unreasonable now. The key here is the transition from pregnancy to postpartum. During pregnancy, there are specific physical and emotional needs, but after giving birth, the dynamics might change. However, the wife is still dealing with postpartum recovery, which is a significant period. Her needs might still be valid, even if the initial reasons (like pregnancy-related nausea) have lessened.\n\nHe says the smell of the upstairs bathroom is \"insulting\" and that she's still watching reality shows. The problem is that he's not considering her current situation. Postpartum can be a time when new parents are stressed, sleep-deprived, and dealing with physical discomfort. She might still need the bathroom restriction for health reasons or just because the smell is a trigger. TV control could be because she's tired and needs to relax, or maybe she's not able to go out much with a newborn. The takeout issue is about budget, but maybe she's still recovering and can't handle cooking, so it's a necessary expense.\n\nHowever, the husband's justification for giving in before was because she was pregnant and had needs. Now, after the baby is born, he's saying \"I did it all\" and wants to return to old habits. The wife might be struggling with postpartum depression or anxiety, and these accommodations were part of supporting her. It's important to consider her well-being and the transition period. The husband might be underestimating her current needs and overemphasizing his own discomfort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about empathy and support. If the wife is still in a vulnerable state, the husband's actions might be seen as not being supportive. On the other hand, if the wife is now healthy and the changes are unnecessary, he might have a point. But the examples given (bathroom smell, TV, takeout) could still be relevant postpartum. The husband's frustration is valid, but the approach matters. He should communicate and find a balance rather than just reverting without considering her current state. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not being supportive during her recovery and the new parenting role.\n"
