Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who adjusted his behavior during his wife's pregnancy, but now, after she gave birth, he's reverting to old habits, and she's upset about it. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the specific examples given. The husband stopped using the upstairs bathroom during pregnancy because the wife was sensitive to smells. Now he wants to use it again, but she's still insisting he doesn't. He also mentions letting her control the TV and ordering takeout, which are now causing tension.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. During pregnancy, the husband made accommodations because he understood her needs. However, after the baby was born, those needs might have changed or still persist. The wife might still have health or personal reasons for these requests. The husband feels that the changes aren't necessary anymore, but it's important to consider if the wife's needs are still valid.\n\nThe husband's actions might come off as dismissive. For example, saying \"her shit doesn't stink\" could be seen as disrespectful. Communication is crucial here. If he stopped accommodating without discussing it with her, that could be the issue. The wife might be adjusting to motherhood and dealing with postpartum challenges, so her requests could be about comfort or stress reduction.\n\nThe financial aspect of takeout is also a factor. If it's straining the budget, that's a valid concern, but the husband should approach it by discussing alternatives rather than just stopping. The wife might rely on those small comforts during a stressful time.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to return to his old ways, but he needs to consider his wife's ongoing needs and communicate better. The initial accommodations were made with understanding, but after the birth, it's important to check in and see if those adjustments are still necessary. Not discussing the changes and reverting abruptly could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not maintaining open communication and respecting his wife's current situation.\n"
