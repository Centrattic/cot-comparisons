Even though some of them were absolutely ridiculous.  I did it all. \n\nShe gave birth in October to our beautiful daughter and I started going back to our old normal, but she\u2019s still insisting on the changes. \n\nFor example when she was pregnant she asked me not to use the upstairs bathroom.  That the smell was too much for her.  I was ok with this while she was pregnant and feeling sick.  Now though it\u2019s just insulting.  Like her shit doesn\u2019t stink.  Surprise, it does.  I just deal with it. \n\nAnother thing is she would get control of the tv.  I let her have it because she\u2019s pregnant, there\u2019s not a lot she can go do so she can watch all the trashy reality shows she wants. \n\nFood is another of our issues now.  She\u2019s gotten used to me running out for take out for her and it honestly hurts the budget.  I don\u2019t want to do it anymore.  When I get home I take over on baby watch.  I shouldn\u2019t also have to go get her a burger. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he went back to his old habits after his wife gave birth, but she's still expecting the same accommodations she had during pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. During pregnancy, many people experience physical discomforts, like nausea or sensitivity to smells. The husband adjusted by not using the upstairs bathroom and letting her watch TV. Those actions were likely driven by empathy and wanting to support her during a tough time.\n\nNow, after the birth, the wife is still expecting these same accommodations. The husband is pushing back, feeling like it's unreasonable. The key here is that postpartum is also a challenging period for the mother. She's recovering from childbirth, possibly dealing with hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, and the stress of caring for a newborn. Her needs might still be significant, even if they're different from during pregnancy.\n\nThe husband's arguments are pragmatic: the bathroom smell is normal, she should share the TV, and he's worried about the budget for takeout. But he's not considering that his wife's continued requests might stem from her current state. For example, maybe she's still sensitive to smells due to lingering hormonal effects, or the TV is her way to cope with stress. Also, postpartum depression or anxiety could affect her behavior.\n\nThe husband's perspective is understandable\u2014he's adjusting to new routines and financial strains. However, the transition back to \"normal\" might not be as simple for the wife. The balance between respecting her needs and his own boundaries is tricky. But in the context of a marriage, supporting each other through these challenges is important. If he's reverting to old ways without considering her ongoing needs, that could be seen as insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife should also communicate her needs clearly and be open to compromise. If she's still struggling, maybe there's a middle ground. But the husband's actions seem dismissive of her ongoing challenges, which could be harmful. The answer likely leans towards the husband being in the wrong (A) because he's not acknowledging her continued needs postpartum, even if they're similar to pregnancy. However, there's a nuance here. If the wife's demands are unreasonable or excessive, that's a different angle, but based on the information given, the husband's dismissiveness is a red flag.\n"
