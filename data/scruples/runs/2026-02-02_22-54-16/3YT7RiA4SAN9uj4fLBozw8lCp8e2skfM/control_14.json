I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation details. The daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent initially recommended Karla when she worked at the hospital. Now, Karla works independently, and the parent wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about it, feeling it's an invasion of privacy.\n\nThe key points here are confidentiality, the daughter's feelings, and the therapist's professional opinion. The parent argues that since the therapist approves and they both can benefit from her services, it's acceptable. They also mention that the daughter isn't giving valid reasons for her objection and that the parent wants to introduce family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with the parents present.\n\nI should consider ethical guidelines for therapists. Typically, having both a parent and child as clients can complicate the therapeutic relationship. There's a potential for dual relationships, which might create conflicts of interest or issues with confidentiality. However, if the therapist is experienced and can maintain boundaries, it might be manageable. The therapist in this case says it's okay, but the daughter is clearly upset. \n\nThe daughter's perspective is important. She's a teenager dealing with her own issues, and feeling that her privacy is being invaded might be a legitimate concern. The parent is trying to balance respecting her feelings while also addressing their own needs. The parent's comparison to a surgeon isn't perfect because therapists deal with confidential information that's different from medical procedures. \n\nThe parent might be overlooking the daughter's emotional needs here. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's distress could indicate that this isn't the best approach. The parent's insistence might undermine the daughter's trust in therapy. Also, the parent's motivation to push for family therapy might not be the right way if the daughter is resistant. \n\nSo, while the therapist's approval is a point in the parent's favor, the daughter's valid concerns about privacy and the potential for the parent to dismiss her feelings as irrational could mean the parent is overstepping. The answer might hinge on whether the parent is respecting the daughter's boundaries despite their own needs.\n"
