I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author, a parent, has a daughter named Ashley who has been seeing a therapist named Karla for a year. The parent introduced Karla to Ashley when she worked at the base hospital. Now Karla has her own practice and the parent wants to start seeing her as well. However, Ashley is upset about this, feeling it's an invasion of her privacy. The parent argues that Karla said it's okay and that they trust her, and they want to use this as a way to involve the family in therapy since Ashley refuses to have sessions with them present.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's privacy concerns, the therapist's approval, the parent's intentions for family therapy, and the daughter's emotional response.\n\nI need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Typically, therapists avoid treating family members of existing clients to prevent potential conflicts of interest or breaches of confidentiality. However, the therapist here, Karla, says it's okay. But maybe the parent didn't consider the daughter's feelings enough. The daughter is a teenager going through a lot, and her privacy is a big concern. Even though the parent knows a lot from patient confidentiality, which doesn't apply here, the daughter might feel uncomfortable if the therapist shares anything about her with the parent, even if it's just general advice.\n\nThe parent's argument about the surgeon analogy might not hold because a surgeon's job is different from a therapist's. A surgeon doesn't need to maintain the same level of confidentiality between patient and practitioner in the same way a therapist does. The parent wants family therapy, but the daughter refuses, so using the same therapist might not be the same as traditional family therapy where all parties are involved together. There's a risk that the daughter's trust in Karla could be damaged if she feels her parent is monitoring her.\n\nAlso, the daughter's resistance could stem from valid feelings of needing space and privacy during her therapy. The parent might be dismissing her concerns as irrational or territorial, which could be a mistake. Validating her feelings and finding another therapist for themselves might be a better approach. Even though Karla approves, the parent should consider the daughter's emotional well-being and respect her boundaries, even if they don't fully agree.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions might be good, the daughter's privacy and comfort are important. The parent might be overstepping by not taking her concerns seriously and potentially complicating the therapeutic relationship. So, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A), but I need to check if there's any other angle. The therapist's okay might mitigate some issues, but the core issue is the daughter's feelings. The parent might not be in the wrong if the therapist is on board, but maybe they are being too dismissive of the daughter's feelings. It's a bit of a grey area, but given the emphasis on client confidentiality and the daughter's distress, the answer might be A. Wait, but the parent is following the therapist's advice. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B. Wait, but the daughter's perspective is valid here. The parent is pushing despite her discomfort. So maybe the answer is A. I'm a bit torn here.\n"
