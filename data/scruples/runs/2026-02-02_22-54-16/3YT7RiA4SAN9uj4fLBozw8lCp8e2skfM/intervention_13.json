I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The situation is that the daughter is uncomfortable, but the therapist, Karla, says it's okay. The author feels the daughter's reaction is irrational and wants to use this as a way to start family therapy since Ashley refuses to have sessions with the parents present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, which is a time when privacy and personal boundaries are really important. Even though the author knows a lot about her situation, she might feel that having her parent in the same therapist's sessions could compromise her trust and openness. Therapists usually maintain confidentiality between patient and therapist, so having the parent involved could make her feel like she's not getting a safe space to talk freely. That's a valid concern.\n\nThen there's the therapist's role. The therapist, Karla, is the one who says it's okay. But therapists also have ethical guidelines to follow. In many cases, having a parent involved in the same therapist's sessions could present a conflict of interest or complicate the therapeutic relationship. The therapist might not be able to be completely neutral or might have to navigate different confidentiality requirements. Karla might be okay with it, but the daughter's feelings need to be considered here.\n\nThe author mentions that they want to introduce family therapy since Ashley refuses to do it otherwise. Family therapy typically involves all family members, so if the parent is seeing the same therapist, that might not be the same as formal family sessions. It could lead to confusion or a lack of structure in addressing family dynamics.\n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction is anger and feeling that her privacy is being breached. The author dismisses this as irrational or territorial behavior, but teenagers often act out as a way to assert independence. The author's insistence might be seen as dismissive of her feelings, which could damage their relationship. Respecting the daughter's autonomy and her need for privacy is important, even if the author disagrees with her stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to seek help for themselves, which is a positive step. They also mention that Karla is the only therapist they trust, which makes sense if she's been helpful with their daughter. However, the key issue here is the daughter's discomfort. Even if the therapist approves, the daughter's emotional well-being and trust are crucial. If she feels her privacy is invaded, that could affect her willingness to continue therapy, which is the opposite of what the author wants.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might be well-intentioned, but they're not respecting the daughter's boundaries and feelings. The therapist's approval isn't enough if it's causing the daughter distress. The author should consider the daughter's perspective and find an alternative way to seek their own therapy without involving the same provider. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they aren't respecting the daughter's privacy and emotional needs.\n"
