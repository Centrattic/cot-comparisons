I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's daughter has been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The author introduced the daughter to Karla through a military hospital connection. Now, Karla works independently and has a good office. The author wants to start seeing Karla too, but the daughter is upset about it. The daughter feels it's a breach of privacy, while the author argues that Karla has confirmed there's no conflict and that it's similar to sharing a surgeon. The wife and daughter think the author is at fault, but Karla says it's okay.\n\nThe key points here are professional boundaries, confidentiality, and the daughter's feelings. The therapist, Karla, has stated there's no conflict, which is important because therapists are trained to manage these situations. However, the daughter's privacy is a valid concern. The author mentions that they already know a lot about Ashley's issues, but patient confidentiality is a legal and ethical obligation. Even if the author is aware of some details, the therapy sessions are confidential, so the daughter might feel that sharing with Karla is less safe if the parent is also a client.\n\nThe author is pushing back against the daughter's objections, comparing it to a surgeon scenario. But the analogy isn't perfect because therapy involves more emotional and personal data, and the therapist-patient relationship is different from a surgeon-patient. The author wants to use this as a step toward family therapy, which Ashley resists, so maybe there's an underlying issue of control or not respecting the daughter's autonomy.\n\nThe daughter is described as a \"troubled teenage girl,\" which the author mentions, but that could be a way to justify their actions. The author is trying to balance respecting the daughter's feelings with their own need for therapy. However, forcing the situation might not be the best approach. The therapist's approval is there, but the daughter's emotional response shouldn't be dismissed entirely. The author might be overlooking the daughter's right to privacy and comfort in her therapy sessions.\n\nIn professional ethics, therapists usually avoid treating family members of existing clients due to potential conflicts. Even if Karla says it's okay, it's possible there are unconsidered dynamics. The daughter's discomfort is a red flag that needs addressing, not just dismissing as irrational. The author might be in the wrong by not fully considering the daughter's perspective and the potential impact on both their therapy relationships.\n"
