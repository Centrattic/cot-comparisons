I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The key points here are the daughter's feelings about privacy, the therapist's approval, and the parent's reasoning.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions that the therapist, Karla, is fine with seeing both the parent and the daughter. Since the therapist is a licensed professional, their opinion matters a lot in determining if there's a conflict of interest or ethical issues. Karla's approval suggests that she's considered the potential dynamics and believes it's acceptable.\n\nNext, the daughter is upset about privacy concerns. The parent acknowledges patient confidentiality but points out that they already know a lot about Ashley's issues. However, therapy is a private space, and sharing the same therapist could make the daughter uncomfortable, even if the parent isn't being intrusive. Teenagers often value their privacy, especially if they're in therapy themselves, which might be a sensitive topic for them.\n\nThe parent also wants to use this as an opportunity for family therapy since Ashley refuses to have sessions with them present. The parent's intention here is to involve the family in the therapeutic process, which is a valid goal. However, if Ashley isn't on board, forcing the issue might backfire, making her more resistant.\n\nThe parent is challenging the daughter to give a reason against it, but the daughter just feels it's a privacy breach. The parent compares it to a surgeon treating both, which is a different context. Surgeons operate, but therapists deal with sensitive, personal information. The analogy might not hold because the nature of the relationship is different.\n\nThe wife and daughter think the parent is wrong, but the parent is relying on the therapist's professional judgment. It's important to consider that the therapist is in the best position to assess the dynamics. However, even with the therapist's approval, the daughter's feelings shouldn't be dismissed. The parent needs to balance their desire for shared therapy with respecting Ashley's autonomy and comfort.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent isn't necessarily at fault for seeking therapy with the same professional, they might need to consider the daughter's perspective more carefully. The therapist's okay is a key point, but the daughter's emotional response is valid. The parent should ensure that Ashley's consent is respected and that the therapy environment remains safe for both parties. The parent's intention to address family issues is positive, but it's crucial to approach it in a way that doesn't force Ashley into discomfort. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that sensitivity to the daughter's feelings is necessary.\n"
