I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter is uncomfortable with this, but the therapist is okay with it. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter feels that it's a breach of her privacy. Even though the parent knows a lot already, the daughter's concern about confidentiality is valid. The therapist is okay with seeing both, but the daughter is a teenager, which can make things tricky because they're developing their own sense of autonomy.\n\nThe parent wants to use this as a way into family therapy since the daughter refuses to have sessions with the parent and spouse present. But the daughter is resistant, possibly feeling territorial or worried about losing privacy. The parent is trying to balance respecting the daughter's feelings while also not giving in to what they see as irrational behavior.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, confidentiality is crucial in therapy. Even if the parent has the best intentions, sharing the same therapist might make the daughter feel that her private thoughts could be discussed with someone else, even if the therapist maintains boundaries. The daughter's reaction might stem from a need for independence, especially during her teenage years.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention to seek therapy is understandable. They might believe that having a trusted therapist can help both them and their daughter. But the daughter's comfort and trust are important. If the daughter doesn't feel safe, that could hinder her therapy progress. The parent should consider the daughter's perspective and perhaps explore alternative ways to involve the therapist without overlapping sessions. Maybe family therapy with separate sessions first could be a better approach.\n\nThe therapist's role here is to maintain professional boundaries. While the therapist says it's okay, they need to ensure that both client relationships remain unaffected. However, the daughter's discomfort is a red flag that needs addressing. The parent's challenge is to respect the daughter's feelings without forcing the issue. Maybe the parent isn't wrong in wanting therapy, but the way they're approaching it might not consider the daughter's need for autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting therapy, but they might not be considering the daughter's emotional needs adequately. The key is finding a balance between the parent's desire for support and the daughter's need for privacy and independence. So, the answer would be B, the parent isn't in the wrong, but they should address the daughter's concerns more thoughtfully.\n"
