I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The story says that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author, the parent, approached Karla and asked if it's okay for them to see the same therapist, and Karla said it's fine. However, the daughter is upset about it, thinking it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that Karla is inclusive with the daughter's progress and that they need to address family issues through therapy, even though the daughter refuses family sessions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the professional ethics of therapy. Therapists are supposed to maintain confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest. If the therapist, Karla, has evaluated the situation and agreed it's acceptable, then that's a point in favor of the parent. However, the daughter's discomfort is significant. Even though the parent is right about confidentiality, the daughter might feel that her privacy is invaded, leading to potential trust issues. Therapy is about making the patient feel safe, so if the daughter is resistant, it could affect her treatment.\n\nAlso, the parent's intention to use this as a way into family therapy is understandable, but the daughter's refusal to have family sessions suggests she might not be ready for that. The parent might be trying to push their agenda, which could come off as overstepping. The daughter's \"territorial\" behavior mentioned by the parent could be a red flag\u2014maybe the parent is being too controlling. However, the parent is trying to address their own mental health as well, which is important.\n\nThe key points are: therapist's approval, daughter's privacy concerns, and the potential impact on both the daughter's therapy and family dynamics. Since the therapist has given the green light, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. But the daughter's feelings should be respected. The parent might not be in the wrong, but they need to be cautious. Answer B (No) seems right because the therapist agrees and the parent is seeking help, but there's a need for sensitivity towards the daughter's feelings.\n"
