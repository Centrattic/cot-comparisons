I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let's break down the details. The parent wants to see the same therapist their daughter is seeing. The therapist, Karla, works independently now and agreed there's no conflict of interest. The daughter, Ashley, is upset about it, feeling it's a breach of her privacy. The parent argues that since they already know a lot about each other's lives and that Karla is trustworthy, it's not an issue. The wife and daughter think the parent is in the wrong, but the parent feels they're justified.\n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy and boundaries. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when they often seek independence and privacy. Even if the parent has a good relationship with the therapist, the daughter's concern about privacy is valid. Therapists are bound by confidentiality, so the parent's access to the same therapist might make the daughter feel like her private sessions aren't safe. The parent mentions that Ashley can't give a reason beyond privacy, but that's a common and legitimate concern, especially for teens who have been through a lot.\n\nThe parent wants to use this as a way to introduce family therapy, but the daughter is already resistant to having her parents in sessions. Making her share a therapist might not be the best approach. Even though the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's emotional reaction should be considered. The parent might be overstepping by not respecting her feelings about privacy, even if the therapist is fine with it. It's possible that the daughter's \"territorial\" behavior is a defense mechanism given her troubled history, so dismissing it as irrational could undermine her need for personal space.\n\nThe parent's comparison to a surgeon is flawed because a surgeon's role is different from a therapist's. Surgeons don't keep detailed private information about patients that would be shared between family members. Therapists deal with sensitive, personal issues, and confidentiality is crucial for building trust. If the parent is involved, even if the therapist is professional, it might affect Ashley's openness during sessions.\n\nSo, while the parent has good intentions and the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's right to privacy and her emotional state need to be prioritized. The parent might not be in the wrong, but their approach could be causing more harm by not respecting the daughter's boundaries. The answer is more nuanced, but since the options are AITA (Am I the Asshole), the parent's actions could be seen as the wrong if they force the situation without considering the daughter's valid concerns.\n"
