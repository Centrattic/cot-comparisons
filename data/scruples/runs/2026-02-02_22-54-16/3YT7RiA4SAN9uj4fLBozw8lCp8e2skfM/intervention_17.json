I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The situation is that the daughter is upset about this, while the therapist, Karla, thinks it's okay. The parent wants to respect their daughter's feelings but also doesn't want to indulge what they see as irrational behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Therapists usually have strict confidentiality rules, and treating family members in the same practice could complicate that. The daughter's privacy is a key concern here. Even though the parent knows a lot, patient confidentiality is a legal and ethical requirement. If the parent and daughter both see the same therapist, there might be situations where the therapist has to navigate whose confidentiality to protect, which could conflict.\n\nThe daughter is a teenager, and adolescence is a time when privacy and autonomy are important. The parent's argument about it being like a surgeon is a bit of a stretch because therapy involves more personal and confidential information than surgery. Also, the parent mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy sessions, so introducing the parent as another client might not address the underlying issues that prevent collaboration.\n\nKarla, the therapist, says it's okay, but the parent should consider if Karla's judgment is unbiased since she's already working with the daughter. There's also the question of whether Karla is equipped to handle the complex dynamics of treating both parent and child without compromising the therapeutic relationship with either.\n\nThe parent's intent is to seek help for themselves and possibly start family therapy. However, forcing this without the daughter's consent could damage trust. The daughter's anger might be valid if she feels her privacy is being invaded. The parent might need to find an alternative, like a different therapist for themself, to respect the daughter's boundaries while still getting the support they need.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's intentions might be good, the situation raises ethical and practical concerns about confidentiality and the daughter's autonomy. The parent might be overstepping by not fully respecting the daughter's objection, even if the therapist is okay with it. So, the answer could lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A), but I need to make sure I'm not missing any points where the parent is justified.\n"
