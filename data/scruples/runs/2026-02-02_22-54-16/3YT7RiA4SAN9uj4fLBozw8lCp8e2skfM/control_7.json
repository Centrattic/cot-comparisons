I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (a parent) is \"in the wrong\" for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about this, citing privacy concerns, while the therapist, Karla, says it's okay. The parent feels the therapist is trustworthy and sees it as a way to possibly start family therapy, which the daughter refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical guidelines for therapists. The American Psychological Association (APA) has strict rules about dual relationships. A therapist shouldn't have multiple relationships with a client's family member if it could impair objectivity or harm the client. Even if the therapist here, Karla, says it's okay, there might be unspoken professional boundaries she's not considering or is violating.\n\nThe daughter's privacy is a key point. Even if the parent knows a lot, sharing the same therapist could breach confidentiality. The daughter might feel her private issues are being discussed with her parent, which could erode trust in the therapeutic relationship. That could make the daughter less likely to open up, which is counterproductive to her therapy.\n\nThe parent mentions that Karla is inclusive and involved them in the daughter's progress. But including the parent in therapy sessions might not be the same as the parent having their own sessions with the same therapist. The therapist's role is to maintain the daughter's best interests, and taking on the parent as a client might create conflicts of interest, especially if there are family dynamics to navigate.\n\nThe parent also argues that it's similar to a surgeon treating multiple family members. However, therapy involves more personal and emotional issues, and the therapeutic alliance relies heavily on confidentiality and trust. A surgeon doesn't typically discuss a patient's personal issues in the presence of family unless it's part of a structured family session, which isn't the case here.\n\nThe daughter's resistance should be taken seriously. As a teenager dealing with her own troubles, she might feel that her privacy is being invaded. The parent's approach could be seen as dismissive of her feelings, especially if they're framing her anger as irrational or territorial without validating her concerns.\n\nWhile the therapist's approval is noted, therapists might not always recognize potential conflicts, especially if they're already treating a family member. The parent should consider seeking a different therapist to avoid any ethical dilemmas and to respect the daughter's boundaries. This would also model respect for privacy, which is important for the daughter's development.\n\nIn summary, even though the parent's intentions might be good, the potential ethical issues and the daughter's right to privacy suggest that the parent is overstepping by wanting the same therapist. The correct answer is likely A (the parent is in the wrong).\n"
