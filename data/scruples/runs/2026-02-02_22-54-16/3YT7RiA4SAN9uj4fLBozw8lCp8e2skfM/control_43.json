I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the parent) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the parent, let's call them Parent, has a daughter who's been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The Parent introduced Karla to the daughter initially. Now Karla works independently and the Parent wants to see her too. The Parent argues that there's no conflict since Karla agreed, and the Parent wants family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with them present. The daughter thinks it's a privacy breach, but the Parent dismisses her concerns, saying they already know most things except confidential info.\n\nSo, the key points here: The daughter's privacy vs. the Parent's desire to involve the same therapist. The therapist's office is independent now, and she's okay with seeing both. The daughter is upset, but the Parent isn't budging, comparing it to a surgeon treating both. The wife also thinks the Parent is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider ethical and psychological aspects. Therapists have ethical guidelines. For example, in many places, a therapist shouldn't have dual relationships with a client, like being a therapist to both a parent and their child. This can create conflicts of interest, especially if the parent wants to discuss the child's therapy. The daughter's privacy is a big part here. Even if the Parent already knows a lot, patient confidentiality is sacred. The therapist might be breaching ethical standards by seeing both, potentially violating the daughter's confidentiality.\n\nAlso, the daughter's feelings matter. She's a teenager, which is a time of seeking autonomy. The Parent is dismissing her concerns as \"territorial\" behavior, but that's not invalid. The daughter might feel her privacy is being invaded, which can affect trust in therapy. The Parent's comparison to a surgeon isn't quite the same\u2014surgeons don't discuss private medical details with family unless the patient consents.\n\nThe therapist's role here is crucial. If Karla agreed, maybe she's aware of the ethics, but maybe not. If she's violating any ethical guidelines, that's a problem. The Parent might be pushing for family therapy, but the daughter's refusal to have the parent present complicates things. The Parent's approach could be seen as not respecting the daughter's autonomy and privacy.\n\nSo, is the Parent in the wrong? Possibly. They might be ignoring the daughter's right to privacy and the potential ethical issues for the therapist. Even if the therapist thinks it's okay, professional standards might say otherwise. The Parent's insistence could damage the daughter's trust in therapy and their relationship. The wife's opinion also suggests that the Parent isn't considering the daughter's perspective enough. \n\nOn the other hand, the Parent is trying to address their own needs and possibly improve family dynamics. But the method\u2014dismissing the daughter's concerns and using the therapist's approval\u2014might not be valid if ethical lines are crossed. The daughter's refusal for family therapy indicates she's not ready, and pushing might not be respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all this, the Parent is likely in the wrong (Answer A) because they're not respecting the daughter's privacy and may be forcing a situation that could ethically conflict with the therapist's role. The therapist's agreement might not override professional ethics, and the Parent's approach undermines the daughter's autonomy.\n"
