I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author (parent) met Karla through their military hospital and sent Ashley to her. Now Karla has her own practice, and the parent wants to see her too. The daughter is upset, feeling it's an invasion of privacy. The parent argues that Karla has experience with both of them and that it's similar to sharing a surgeon. The wife also thinks the parent is in the wrong, but the therapist says it's okay.\n\nHmm, boundaries in therapy are important. Therapists usually maintain confidentiality between sessions. If the parent and daughter are both seeing the same therapist, the therapist needs to handle each case separately. But maybe there's a conflict here. The daughter feels her privacy is breached, which is a valid concern. Even if the parent claims to know most things, the professional boundary is there for a reason. Also, the daughter refuses family therapy, so forcing the same therapist might not help. The parent is dismissing the daughter's feelings as irrational, which could be a problem. However, the therapist says it's fine, which might mean there's a professional agreement on managing both cases. But the daughter's emotional response is significant here. It's about respecting her autonomy and privacy. Even if the parent has good intentions, the daughter's discomfort is real. So maybe the parent is overstepping by not respecting her feelings. The answer could lean towards AITA being the parent (A), but if the therapist is okay with it, maybe there's a way to manage it. But the daughter's right to privacy is a big factor. I think the parent is in the wrong here because they're ignoring the daughter's valid concerns about privacy and boundaries, even if the therapist is okay with it. So answer A.\n"
