I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter, Ashley, is upset about it. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay. The author feels that Karla is the only therapist they trust and that it could help with family therapy since Ashley refuses to do sessions with them.\n\nHmm, first, the daughter's privacy is a big concern here. Even though the author mentions patient confidentiality, sharing the same therapist might make the daughter feel her privacy is invaded. Teenagers are often sensitive about their privacy, especially if they're already troubled. The author is trying to balance respecting her feelings but not giving in to what they see as irrational behavior.\n\nThe therapist's approval is important, but maybe the therapist isn't considering the daughter's emotional response. The author is using an example about a surgeon to justify the situation, but that's different because surgeons don't have the same confidentiality issues. Therapy involves sensitive topics, so having the same therapist could complicate things for the daughter. The author might not fully grasp why the daughter is so upset, thinking it's just territorial behavior. But maybe there's more to it. \n\nAlso, the author wants to push for family therapy, but if the daughter is resistant, forcing the issue by using the same therapist might backfire. The daughter might feel coerced, leading to more resistance. The author's intention is good\u2014they want to help and be involved\u2014but the approach could be causing more harm. \n\nI think the key points are the daughter's privacy, her emotional state, and the therapist's role. Even though the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's well-being should be the priority. The author might not be in the wrong, but they need to consider the daughter's perspective more. So, maybe the answer is B, but there's a nuance here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is acting in good faith and the therapist approves, maybe B is correct. But I'm a bit conflicted because the daughter's feelings are valid too.\n"
