I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, thinking it's a privacy breach, but the therapist says it's okay. The author is a military parent, their daughter Ashley has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author introduced Ashley to Karla initially and now wants to see her too. The daughter is against it, but the author feels it's important for family therapy since they can't do sessions together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. Teenagers, especially those in therapy, might feel their privacy is invaded if a parent joins the same therapist. Even if the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's feelings are valid. She might feel like her personal issues are being shared with her parent, which could make her uncomfortable or less open in therapy. That could affect the effectiveness of her sessions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to engage in family therapy, which is a valid approach. The therapist's approval is a key point here. If Karla, as a professional, thinks it's fine, that might indicate there's no conflict of interest. But the author should also consider the daughter's feelings seriously. The daughter's resistance might be part of her therapy process; she might be testing boundaries or dealing with issues that would be exacerbated by having her parent in the same sessions.\n\nThe author mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy and gets angry. The parent wants to address this by seeing the same therapist, but if the daughter is already resistant, forcing the issue might not be the right approach. Respecting the daughter's autonomy and her right to privacy is important. Even if the parent's intention is good, pushing through without the daughter's consent could backfire, leading to more resistance or harm in the therapeutic relationship.\n\nThere's also the aspect of patient confidentiality. The therapist can't share details from the daughter's sessions with the parent without the daughter's consent, so the parent might not get the information they expect. The author's argument about the surgeon analogy might not hold because surgery is a different context than therapy, where confidentiality and emotional boundaries are crucial.\n\nThe wife's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, which adds another perspective. The author might be dismissing the daughter's valid concerns by challenging her to give a reason, which could come off as dismissive. The daughter's \"territorial behavior\" might actually be a justified reaction to privacy concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, the daughter's feelings and privacy concerns are significant. The therapist's approval is professional, but the emotional impact on the daughter should be considered. The author might be in the wrong for not fully respecting the daughter's boundaries despite the therapist's okay. So the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
