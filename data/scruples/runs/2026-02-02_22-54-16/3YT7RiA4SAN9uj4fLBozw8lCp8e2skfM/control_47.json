I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent (the author) met Karla through the military hospital and thought she was perfect for Ashley. They sent her to group sessions, and she transitioned to one-on-one. Now Karla has her own practice and the parent wants to see her too. The therapist said it's okay, but the daughter is upset about it, feeling it's a privacy breach.\n\nThe parent argues that they already know a lot about Ashley's issues, and that patient confidentiality covers the rest. They also mention that the daughter is a troubled teen and that they want to use this as a way to introduce family therapy, which Ashley refuses. The wife and daughter think the parent is at fault (TA), but the therapist is okay with it.\n\nSo, the key points here are confidentiality, the daughter's feelings, and the therapist's professional opinion. The parent is trying to balance their own mental health needs with respecting their daughter's privacy and boundaries. The therapist's approval is a factor, but the daughter feels her privacy is being invaded.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, therapists usually advise against having a therapist who treats multiple family members because it can create conflicts of interest. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's discomfort is valid. The parent might not be \"wrong\" in wanting to seek therapy, but imposing on the daughter's space could be problematic. The parent should consider the daughter's feelings and perhaps look for another therapist themselves to avoid complicating the therapeutic relationship. So, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they're disregarding the daughter's privacy concerns despite her being a minor and needing her own safe space. But I need to check if the parent's actions cross a line here.\n"
