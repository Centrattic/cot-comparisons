I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. \n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent approached Karla about also being her therapist, and Karla agreed there's no conflict. The daughter is upset, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that since the therapist is okay with it, it's not a problem and might help with family therapy.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and consent. The daughter is a teenager who is already in therapy, which suggests she might be dealing with sensitive issues. Even though the parent has a good relationship with Karla, the daughter's comfort and trust are important. Therapy is a confidential space, and having a parent involved could make her feel her privacy is invaded. The parent mentions that Karla is fine with it, but the daughter's feelings are valid. The parent is using a surgeon analogy, but that's different because in surgery, the same surgeon doesn't typically have to manage both patients' emotional disclosures. \n\nThe parent wants to push through despite the daughter's objections, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The daughter's resistance might be rooted in a desire for independence or fear of judgment. The parent's approach could undermine the therapeutic relationship if the daughter feels pressured. Even if Karla approves, the daughter's consent is crucial. The parent's dismissal of the daughter's concerns as \"irrational\" could worsen the conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent is not considering the daughter's perspective adequately. They should respect her feelings and perhaps explore family therapy with a different therapist to avoid boundary issues. So, the answer would be A (the parent is in the wrong).\n"
