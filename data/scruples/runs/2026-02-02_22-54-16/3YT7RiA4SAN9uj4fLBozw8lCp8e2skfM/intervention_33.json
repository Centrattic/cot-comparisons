I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The parent arranged for Ashley to see Dr. Karla after meeting her through the military hospital. Now, the parent wants to see the same therapist too, but Ashley is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Therapists usually have boundaries about treating multiple family members. Even though Dr. Karla says it's okay, there might be potential conflicts. For example, discussing one family member in sessions could affect the other's confidentiality. The daughter feels her privacy is being invaded, which is a valid concern. Teenagers might be more sensitive about this, especially if they're already dealing with personal issues.\n\nThe parent mentions that Ashley refuses family therapy, and they want to use this as a step towards it. But if Ashley is resistant, forcing the issue might backfire. The parent's argument about a surgeon being okay is a bit of a stretch. Therapy isn't the same as surgery; it's more about trust and personal conversations. The parent might not realize how important confidentiality is in therapy, especially for a teenager who might feel exposed if their parent is also a client.\n\nThe therapist's approval is part of the equation, but the parent should also consider their daughter's feelings. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's distress is significant. The parent might be dismissing her valid concerns as \"territorial behavior,\" which could be undermining her legitimate need for privacy. It's possible the parent isn't recognizing the psychological impact this could have on Ashley.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the American Psychological Association has guidelines about dual relationships. While it's not explicitly prohibited, it can create conflicts. The therapist needs to ensure that treating both parent and child doesn't compromise either's care. If the daughter is actively opposed and the parent is pushing regardless, it might not be in the best interest of the daughter. \n\nSo, while the parent isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in wanting support, they might be overlooking the daughter's emotional needs and the professional boundaries that should protect her. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because they're disregarding the daughter's privacy concerns despite her valid reasons.\n"
