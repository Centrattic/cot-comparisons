I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let's look at the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The parent introduced her to the therapist initially through a group session. Now, the therapist is independent, and the parent wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that they already know a lot about Ashley's issues and that it's similar to being treated by the same surgeon. They also mention that the daughter refuses family therapy with them present.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, therapists usually avoid dual relationships to prevent conflicts of interest. However, the therapist here seems to consent and thinks it's fine. The parent is trying to access a trusted professional, which is understandable. The daughter's concern about privacy is valid; sharing a therapist with a parent could make her feel uncomfortable, especially if they're already close. But the parent is trying to be reasonable, acknowledging the daughter's feelings while also considering their own needs and the potential for family therapy.\n\nThe daughter's resistance might stem from a desire for independence, which is common in teens. The parent wants to respect her feelings but also not reward what they see as irrational behavior. It's a balancing act. The therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's comfort is also crucial. Since the therapist is okay with it and the parent is trying to navigate this respectfully, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, there's a potential for the daughter to feel her privacy is invaded, which could affect her therapy. But the parent isn't forcing the issue and is considering the possibility of family therapy, which might be a better approach. So, considering all angles, the parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
