I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent wanting to see the same therapist as their teenage daughter. The daughter is upset about this, citing privacy concerns. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the parent and the daughter. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when they might push back against parental authority more. She might feel that sharing a therapist with her parent could breach her privacy, even if the parent isn't getting all the details. The parent argues that the therapist has the skills and that they could use family therapy, but the daughter refuses family sessions. The parent is trying to get the daughter to open up, but she's resistant.\n\nThe therapist's role is important here. The therapist is the one who agreed to see both the parent and the daughter, which suggests that from a professional standpoint, there's no conflict of interest. However, the daughter's feelings about privacy are valid. Even if the parent knows a lot already, the daughter might feel that having her parent involved in her therapy sessions could make her feel less safe to share openly. Therapists typically maintain confidentiality, but the parent's presence, even if they aren't in the sessions, might create a sense of violation for the daughter. \n\nThe parent is trying to balance respecting the daughter's feelings with not giving in to what they perceive as irrational anger or territorial behavior. However, the daughter's resistance could be a legitimate emotional response. The parent's comparison to a surgeon is a bit of a stretch because therapy involves more personal and emotional aspects than a physical procedure. The parent might not fully grasp the emotional weight of sharing a therapist with a family member, even if the therapist approves.\n\nIn family therapy, all parties are involved in the sessions. The daughter isn't open to that, but the parent is trying to use this approach by having both of them with the same therapist. The therapist might think it's okay, but the daughter's discomfort is still a factor. The parent's decision to proceed without the daughter's consent could harm the therapeutic relationship. The daughter might feel coerced, which could lead to her disengaging from therapy altogether.\n\nSo, while the parent's intentions might be good\u2014seeking support from a trusted therapist\u2014they might be overlooking the daughter's emotional and privacy concerns. The daughter's right to confidentiality and her feelings about privacy are significant, even if the parent doesn't see them as valid. The therapist's approval doesn't negate the daughter's emotional response. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong by pushing forward despite the daughter's clear discomfort, even if the therapist is okay with it.\n"
