I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The situation is that Ashley is already seeing a therapist named Karla, and the author (probably a parent) wants to start therapy with the same person. The daughter is upset about this, citing privacy concerns, while the therapist thinks it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The daughter feels it's a breach of her privacy. Parents might not see privacy the same way as teenagers, especially if they feel they're already involved in their child's therapy. But the daughter is a teenager, which is a time when they start asserting their independence, so her resistance could be valid. The therapist, Karla, says there's no conflict of interest and is okay with it. That's a professional opinion, so maybe the parent is justified in trusting her. However, the daughter's resistance is significant\u2014she's a \"troubled\" teenager, which might mean she's more sensitive to issues of autonomy and privacy. The parent wants to use this as a way to introduce family therapy, which could be a good idea if done consensually, but the daughter is refusing family sessions, so forcing her might not help. The parent is concerned about not giving into anger or territorial behavior, but that doesn't mean the daughter's feelings are invalid. Therapy should be a safe space, and if the daughter feels her privacy is compromised, that could affect her trust and effectiveness of her therapy. The therapist's agreement is important, but the parent should also consider the daughter's emotional needs. Maybe there's a middle ground, like different therapists who can collaborate, but the parent is set on Karla. The parent's reasoning about a surgeon analogy is a bit off; that's different because there's no confidential information shared between the parent and surgeon. The main issue is whether the parent is respecting the daughter's privacy versus their own needs. The author might not be wrong, but the situation is complicated. However, the daughter's right to privacy in therapy is a fundamental ethical consideration. The parent's insistence might override the daughter's comfort, which could be harmful. So, even though the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's feelings matter. The parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but the daughter's perspective is valid. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with caveats. Wait, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. But according to ethical guidelines in therapy, having the same therapist for parent and child can be problematic if the child feels their privacy is invaded. So maybe the parent is in the wrong here. But the therapist said it's okay. Hmm. This is tricky. The parent's intention is to include the family, which is good, but the method might be bad. So, the parent's action is not wrong, but the approach could be improved. The daughter's feelings are important, and the parent should address them, maybe find another therapist for themselves to respect the daughter's wishes. But the parent is convinced the therapist is the best. I think the answer is A, the parent is in the wrong because they are ignoring the daughter's privacy concerns despite those concerns being valid, even if the therapist says it's okay. The parent's reasoning about the surgeon is flawed because that's different. The daughter's right to privacy in therapy is a key factor here. So, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
