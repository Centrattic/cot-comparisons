I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the father wants to see the same therapist as his daughter. The daughter is upset about it, saying it's a breach of her privacy. The therapist, Karla, thinks it's okay. The father argues that since they're both patients, it's similar to seeing the same surgeon, and he wants to do family therapy since the daughter refuses to have sessions with him or his wife present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when kids often push boundaries and value their privacy more. Even if the father has a good relationship with the therapist, the daughter might feel uncomfortable sharing personal issues if her parent is also a patient. There's also the aspect of professional boundaries. Therapists usually maintain strict confidentiality between themselves and their patients. If the therapist is treating both parent and child, there could be potential conflicts in maintaining that confidentiality, even if the therapist says it's okay. Maybe the therapist isn't fully aware of all the implications or is downplaying them.\n\nThe father might be right that the therapist is okay with it, but the daughter's feelings are valid. Privacy is important, especially for teens dealing with emotional issues. If the daughter is resistant to family therapy already, adding the father's presence as a patient might make her even more uncomfortable. The father's comparison to a surgeon doesn't hold because a surgeon's work is more clinical and doesn't involve the same level of personal, emotional disclosure as therapy does.\n\nAlso, the daughter's anger might not be just about privacy. It could be about feeling that her autonomy is being invaded. Even if the father thinks he already knows most things, the therapy sessions might be the only space where the daughter feels safe to share things she doesn't want her parents to know. The therapist's role is to create a safe, confidential environment, and involving the parent might undermine that.\n\nOn the other hand, the father's intention is to seek help for himself and possibly encourage family therapy. If the therapist is okay with it, maybe there's a way to handle it without breaching confidentiality. But the daughter's opposition is significant. It's possible that the father is not considering how his actions might affect the daughter's trust in both the therapist and the treatment process. If the daughter feels her privacy is violated, she might disengage from therapy altogether, which would be counterproductive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the father's intentions might be good, the daughter's feelings about privacy and autonomy are important. The therapist's approval doesn't negate the daughter's valid concerns. The father might be overstepping by not respecting her boundaries, even if he's trying to get help. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's disregarding his daughter's feelings and potential professional boundaries.\n"
