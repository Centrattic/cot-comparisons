I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been seeing a therapist named Karla for a year. The parent met Karla through the military's on-base hospital, thought she was a good fit for Ashley, and introduced her. Now Karla works independently and the parent wants to see her as well. Karla says it's okay, but the daughter is against it, feeling her privacy is breached.\n\nThe parent argues that since Karla is trustworthy and the daughter isn't giving a valid reason, they should proceed. They also mention that the daughter refuses family therapy and that they want to model healthy behavior. The wife also thinks the parent is wrong.\n\nHmm. From a privacy standpoint, having the same therapist might make the daughter uncomfortable. Even if the parent is aware of some things, the therapist-patient relationship is confidential, and the daughter might feel her private issues are being shared. The parent might not realize the emotional impact this has on the daughter. They mention the daughter is \"troubled,\" so this could be a sensitive situation.\n\nKarla's professional opinion is that it's fine, but the daughter's consent is important. Therapy is a personal space, and the daughter might feel her autonomy is being invaded. The parent's analogy about a surgeon doesn't quite match because that's a different type of relationship. The parent might be dismissing the daughter's valid concerns as just teenage behavior, which could be a mistake.\n\nThe parent's intention is to seek help, but the method might not consider the daughter's feelings. Respect for the daughter's boundaries is crucial here. Even if the therapist approves, the daughter's comfort and trust are important for her continued therapy. The parent might need to find another therapist to avoid causing further conflict and to respect the daughter's privacy. So, maybe the author is in the wrong here because they're not fully respecting the daughter's boundaries despite Karla's approval.\n"
