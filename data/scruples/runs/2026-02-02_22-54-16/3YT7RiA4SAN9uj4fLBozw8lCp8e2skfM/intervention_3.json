I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley.\n\nFirst, the author and their daughter both see Dr. Karla. The daughter is upset about this. The author argues that the therapist agreed it's fine, and they see no issue beyond privacy. They also mention the daughter's resistance to family therapy and their military background as part of the context.\n\nI need to consider ethical guidelines for therapists. Typically, therapists have strict boundaries to maintain confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest. If a therapist is treating multiple family members, there are specific protocols. But the therapist here, Karla, has already agreed. However, the daughter feels her privacy is invaded. Even if the therapist thinks it's okay, the daughter's feelings matter. Therapists might recommend separate sessions to avoid transference issues or breaches of confidentiality. The daughter's refusal to engage in joint sessions might indicate she's not ready, which the author is trying to address, but pushing could backfire. Also, the daughter's \"territorial\" behavior vs. valid privacy concerns is a point. The author might not realize the depth of the daughter's resistance or the potential for power dynamics in the therapy relationship. While the author's intent is good, the situation might require a more nuanced approach, respecting the daughter's boundaries even if they seem irrational. The therapist's approval doesn't necessarily override the daughter's comfort. So, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely wrong, but there are aspects where they could be misunderstanding the daughter's needs.\n"
