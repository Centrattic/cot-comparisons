I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent, let's call them Parent, and their daughter Ashley has been seeing a therapist named Karla for a year. The Parent met Karla through the military hospital and thought she'd be a good fit for Ashley. Ashley started attending group sessions and later went to individual sessions with Karla. Now Karla works independently, and the Parent wants to start seeing her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset, thinking it's a privacy breach. The Parent argues that Karla is the only therapist they trust and that it's no different than sharing a surgeon. The wife and daughter think the Parent is in the wrong (TA), but the Parent thinks the therapist's approval makes it okay.\n\nFirst, I should consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, which can be a time of wanting privacy and independence. Sharing a therapist with a parent might make her feel her privacy is invaded. Even though Karla is a professional and confidentiality applies, the daughter might feel uncomfortable. The Parent acknowledges that there's patient confidentiality, but maybe the daughter still feels uneasy. The Parent is challenging the daughter to give a reason, but she can't, which might indicate it's more about feeling than a logical reason.\n\nTherapists have guidelines about dual relationships. If Karla agreed to see both the Parent and Ashley, she might have considered potential conflicts. However, having both parent and child with the same therapist can complicate boundaries. The therapist's role is supposed to be neutral, and if the Parent is involved, it might affect the therapy dynamics. The daughter's refusal to do family therapy suggests she's not ready for that step, so adding the Parent to her individual sessions could create tension.\n\nThe Parent's reasoning includes wanting family therapy and not wanting to reward the daughter's anger. But forcing the issue might backfire. The daughter's anger could be valid if she feels her privacy is being invaded. The Parent might be projecting their own needs (trust in the therapist) onto the situation without fully considering the daughter's emotional boundaries.\n\nThe therapist's approval is a point for the Parent, but it's possible the therapist didn't consider the daughter's emotional response. Professional guidelines usually advise against dual relationships if they could harm the client. Even if the therapist is okay, the daughter's consent isn't there, which is important. The daughter is a client too, and her consent matters in her treatment.\n\nSo, while the Parent's intention is to seek trusted help, the daughter's feelings about privacy and autonomy are significant. The Parent might not be in the wrong entirely, but they might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's boundaries despite the therapist's approval. The daughter's refusal to engage in family therapy might indicate she's not ready, and pushing could harm the therapeutic relationship. The Parent needs to consider that the daughter's distress is valid and that forcing the issue could make things worse.\n\nIn conclusion, the Parent's actions might be well-intentioned, but they could be disregarding the daughter's need for privacy and autonomy. The therapist's approval doesn't override the daughter's consent. Therefore, the Parent might be in the wrong by proceeding without considering the daughter's perspective adequately.\n"
