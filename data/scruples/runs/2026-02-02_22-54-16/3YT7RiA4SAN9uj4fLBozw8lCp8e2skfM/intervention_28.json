I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a daughter (Ashley) who's been seeing a therapist named Karla for a year. The parent met Karla through work and recommended her to Ashley, who liked her and then started one-on-one sessions. Now Karla works independently, and the parent wants to see her too. The daughter is upset about it, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that Karla said it's okay and that it's similar to a surgeon treating multiple family members. The wife and daughter think the parent is wrong, but the parent feels they're justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical guidelines for therapists. Therapists have strict rules about dual relationships, which can include seeing multiple people from the same family. If Karla is a licensed professional, she would know whether this is appropriate. The fact that she agreed to see the parent suggests she's comfortable with the boundaries. However, the daughter's concern about privacy is valid. Even if the therapist believes it's okay, the daughter might feel uncomfortable if her information is discussed between parent and therapist. \n\nBut the parent mentions that Karla is inclusive with Ashley's progress. That could mean the parent is already part of the therapeutic process to some extent. However, patient confidentiality is a key issue. The therapist should ensure that the daughter's private information isn't shared without consent. The parent says they reminded Ashley about confidentiality, which is important. \n\nThe daughter is described as a troubled teenager, which might make her more sensitive about privacy. The parent wants family therapy, which the daughter refuses. The parent's reasoning is that Karla is the only therapist they trust and that the daughter isn't giving a good reason for her objection. The parent compares it to a surgeon treating multiple family members, which is a common scenario but doesn't exactly parallel the therapy situation.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because the therapist has approved it and there's no clear ethical violation on the parent's part. However, the daughter's feelings about privacy should be respected. The key point is whether the therapist is managing boundaries properly. If Karla is competent and the parent is aware of confidentiality, then it's okay. But the parent should also be sensitive to the daughter's concerns and ensure that the daughter's privacy isn't compromised. The answer seems to be B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's a need to balance the daughter's feelings and privacy.\n"
