I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The scenario involves the author's daughter, Ashley, who's been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author met Karla through the military hospital and recommended her to Ashley, who then started seeing her. Now Karla works independently, and the author wants to see her too, but Ashley is against it, citing privacy concerns. The therapist says it's okay.\n\nHmm, the key points here are privacy, professional boundaries, and the daughter's feelings. The daughter is a teenager, which can make these situations more sensitive. The author argues that the therapist has no issues with it and that there's no conflict of interest. But the daughter feels it's a breach of her privacy. \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, therapists usually have strict confidentiality rules. Even if the therapist is okay with seeing both, the daughter's discomfort is valid. The daughter might feel that her private information could be shared, even if it's not legally or ethically allowed. The author is challenging her feelings as irrational, but teenagers often have strong emotional reactions, especially if they're already troubled.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy with them present. This might indicate that the daughter is struggling with trust or feels unheard. Pushing to see the same therapist despite her objections could be seen as dismissing her feelings, even if the therapist is okay with it. \n\nWhile the therapist's approval is important, the daughter's emotional well-being is crucial. Respecting her boundaries, even if they seem irrational, might be necessary to maintain trust. The author might not be in the wrong legally or professionally, but emotionally, they could be overstepping by not fully considering the daughter's perspective. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the therapist says it's okay. Wait, but the therapist's role is to ensure confidentiality and professional standards, so if she's okay with it, maybe it's manageable. However, the daughter's feelings are still a significant factor. The author might be prioritizing their own needs over the daughter's comfort, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, if the therapist is maintaining confidentiality and the author is just seeking help, maybe it's not wrong. But the daughter's privacy is a big deal here. Maybe the author should find another therapist to avoid causing conflict. I think the answer is A, because even though the therapist approves, the daughter's privacy is a key ethical consideration, and the author might be ignoring her feelings. So the author is in the wrong by not respecting her daughter's boundaries.\n"
