I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a parent wanting to see the same therapist their daughter is seeing, even though the daughter objects.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The daughter has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent, who initially connected the daughter with Karla, now wants to have sessions with Karla too. The therapist is okay with it, but the daughter is upset about privacy. The parent argues that since the therapist works independently and there's no conflict of interest, it's acceptable. They also mention that the daughter refuses family therapy and see this as an introduction.\n\nI should think about boundaries here. Therapists usually have strict confidentiality rules. Even if the therapist is okay with seeing both, the parent is a family member of the daughter. If the parent and daughter are both clients, there could be potential conflicts in confidentiality. For example, if the parent shares details about the daughter's sessions, that could violate the daughter's privacy. But the parent might not be aware of all the specific information the daughter discusses. However, the daughter's concern is valid because she might feel that her private information could be shared with the parent, even if the therapist is supposed to keep it confidential.\n\nThe therapist's role is to maintain confidentiality for all clients. If the therapist is agreeing to see both, they must have protocols in place to ensure that no information is shared between the two. But from the daughter's perspective, it's still possible she might feel uncomfortable, especially if she's a teenager dealing with personal issues. The parent's argument about family therapy is a point, but the daughter isn't open to that, so maybe the parent is trying to push through this method instead of finding another way.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the daughter is \"troubled\" and has been through a lot. This might mean that the daughter has sensitive issues she's discussing in therapy, which she wouldn't want the parent to know about. The parent might not realize the depth of the daughter's concerns or the importance of maintaining that privacy. The parent's desire to see the same therapist might stem from wanting support and understanding from someone they trust, but they might not be considering the daughter's emotional boundaries and need for privacy.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes, therapists have policies against treating family members together to avoid conflicts of interest or boundary issues. Even if the therapist says it's okay, there might be ethical considerations. The parent should check if the therapist has a clear policy on this. If the therapist is comfortable with it, maybe they've considered these factors, but the parent's main issue is the daughter's reaction.\n\nIn summary, while the parent isn't necessarily wrong in wanting support from a trusted therapist, they might be overlooking the daughter's valid concerns about privacy. The daughter's feelings about her therapy being a safe space could be compromised. The parent's approach might be dismissive of the daughter's emotional response, even if they're trying to be logical. So, the answer could lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A) because they're not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns and might be pushing despite her discomfort.\n"
