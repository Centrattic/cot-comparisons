I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the parent, let's call him \"John,\" already has his daughter, Ashley, seeing a therapist named Karla. He approached Karla about joining the sessions, and she agreed there's no conflict. However, Ashley is upset about it, feeling it breaches her privacy. John argues that since Karla is a professional and has the daughter's best interest in mind, it's acceptable. He also mentions that his wife and daughter think he's at fault, but he doesn't see why.\n\nThe question is whether John is in the wrong (A) or not (B). To determine this, I need to consider boundaries, privacy, and professional ethics. \n\nTherapists typically have strict confidentiality rules. If John starts seeing Karla, even if she agrees, there could be complications. For example, if Karla needs to discuss Ashley's private issues with John, that might violate the confidentiality between Ashley and Karla. The daughter's concern about privacy is valid here. Even if Karla is comfortable, the daughter's feelings and comfort are crucial in this situation. \n\nJohn's reasoning about family therapy is interesting. However, if Ashley refuses family therapy, forcing it by having the same therapist might not be the best approach. It could make her feel her privacy is not respected, which might worsen the situation. \n\nAlso, the parent's role in the therapist's office changes if they become a client. The dynamic between Karla, Ashley, and John could become complicated, especially if Karla needs to maintain professional boundaries with both. \n\nWhile the therapist's approval is a point in John's favor, the daughter's emotional well-being and right to privacy are significant factors. The parent might be overstepping by not respecting Ashley's clear discomfort, even if he thinks he's justified. \n\nIn conclusion, even though Karla agrees, the daughter's privacy concerns are valid. The parent might not be in the wrong from Karla's perspective, but respecting Ashley's feelings is essential. However, considering the potential breach of confidentiality and the daughter's distress, the parent could be in the wrong for not prioritizing her comfort and boundaries.\n"
