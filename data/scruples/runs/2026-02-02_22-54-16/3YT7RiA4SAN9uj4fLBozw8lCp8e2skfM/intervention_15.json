I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent introduced her to the therapist through the military hospital. Now Karla works independently and the parent wants to see her too. The daughter is upset about it, saying it's a privacy breach. The parent thinks it's similar to a surgeon treating multiple family members and doesn't see an issue. The therapist also says it's okay.\n\nI should consider therapist boundaries and confidentiality. Therapists usually avoid treating family members of their existing patients to prevent conflicts. Even if Karla says it's okay, ethical guidelines might advise against it. The daughter's privacy is a key point here. Even if the parent knows a lot, the therapist-patient relationship is confidential. The daughter might feel her privacy is invaded, which could affect her trust in the therapy.\n\nThe parent argues that the therapist is okay with it, but professional ethics might override the therapist's personal opinion. Also, the parent's motivation to involve the therapist for family therapy could be valid, but the daughter's resistance suggests it's not the right time. The parent might not realize the potential negative impact on the daughter's therapy experience.\n\nSo, even though the therapist agrees, the parent might be in the wrong by not considering the daughter's feelings and the ethical implications. The daughter's privacy and therapy effectiveness are important factors here.\n"
