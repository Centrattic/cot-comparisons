I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The scenario is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author, who's a parent, now wants to see Karla too, but Ashley is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Therapists usually avoid dual relationships to prevent conflicts of interest. But Karla says it's okay, and the author is seeking individual sessions, not family therapy. The daughter is worried about privacy. The parent argues that the therapist has given the green light and that it's similar to being treated by the same surgeon.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, if Karla is comfortable and there's no conflict, maybe it's acceptable. But the daughter's feelings are valid too. Parents might want to be involved, but teenagers value their privacy. The parent might be overstepping, even if the therapist agrees. The daughter's resistance could indicate she's not ready for that dynamic. But the parent is trying to address family issues and improve communication.\n\nI need to weigh the parent's intentions against the daughter's rights. The parent isn't forcing the daughter to be in sessions together, just wanting individual sessions. If the therapist is okay with it, maybe the parent isn't wrong. However, the daughter's privacy is important. The answer might depend on whether Karla can maintain separate, unbiased sessions with both. If there's a risk of information being shared, that's a problem. Since the parent is seeking individual therapy, maybe it's okay. The key here is that the therapist has a professional opinion that it's fine. So perhaps the parent isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
