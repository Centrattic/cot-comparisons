I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The scenario is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent, the author, also wants to see Karla now. The daughter is uncomfortable, feeling it's a breach of privacy, but the therapist says it's okay. The author argues that there's no conflict, and maybe it could lead to family therapy since the daughter won't have sessions with family present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical boundaries in therapy. Therapists are trained to maintain confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest. Karla, the therapist, has already assessed the situation and said it's fine. That's a key point. If the therapist is comfortable, maybe there's professional reasoning there. However, the daughter is upset, so the parent's decision might affect the daughter's trust in therapy. \n\nThe parent's intention is to seek therapy with someone they trust, which is understandable. But the daughter's privacy and autonomy are important, especially for a teenager. The parent mentions the daughter is \"troubled,\" so maybe family therapy could help, but if the daughter refuses, pushing for the same therapist might not be the best approach. \n\nHowever, the parent isn't forcing the daughter to attend sessions with them; they're just seeking their own therapy. The daughter might feel territorial or that her privacy is invaded, which is a valid concern. The parent is challenging the daughter to give reasons against it, but the daughter's feelings are valid even if she can't articulate them clearly. \n\nOn the other hand, the therapist's approval is significant. If Karla is professional and has boundaries, she would ensure that the parent's sessions don't compromise the daughter's. The parent might not be in the wrong if they've considered the therapist's opinion and the daughter's feelings, even if the daughter is resistant. \n\nBut there's a risk of the parent dismissing the daughter's concerns as \"irrational,\" which could harm their relationship. The parent wants to respect the daughter's feelings but also not reward anger, which is a tough balance. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because they've taken the therapist's professional opinion into account. However, they should also consider the daughter's emotional state and find ways to address her concerns without dismissing them. The answer is likely B (No), as the parent's actions are within their rights and supported by the therapist, though they should be cautious about the daughter's perspective.\n"
