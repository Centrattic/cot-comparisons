I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, is already seeing therapist Karla, and the parent (the author) wants to see Karla too. The daughter is upset about it, thinking it's a privacy breach. The therapist says it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parent has a good relationship with the therapist and feels it's important for their own mental health. The daughter is a teenager, which can be a tricky time, especially if she's already dealing with some issues. She might feel that the parent is encroaching on her space or trying to control her therapy experience. \n\nTherapists generally have strict confidentiality rules, so the parent mentioning they know most things already might not be entirely accurate. Patient confidentiality is a big part of therapy, so the daughter's concern is valid. Even if the parent is told about general progress, specific details should remain confidential. The parent might not realize how much their presence could affect the daughter's openness in sessions.\n\nThe therapist's approval is important, but maybe the parent didn't consider the daughter's feelings enough. The daughter's refusal to have family therapy with the parent and spouse suggests there might be underlying issues they're not addressing. The parent's comparison to a surgeon isn't quite the same\u2014therapy involves more personal and emotional aspects, so the dynamic is different. \n\nAlso, the daughter feeling territorial might stem from a need for autonomy, especially if she's been through a lot. The parent wants to model healthy behavior by getting therapy, which is good, but they need to balance that with respecting their daughter's boundaries. Maybe the parent is overstepping by not giving the daughter enough space to process her own therapy without the parent's presence. \n\nIn terms of professional ethics, therapists often advise against multiple relationships if they could interfere with treatment. The therapist might say it's okay, but the parent should still consider if it's truly the best for the daughter. The parent's approach might be causing more conflict than needed. \n\nSo, while the parent's intention is good, the action might be infringing on the daughter's privacy and could hinder her therapy progress. The answer leans towards the parent being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. However, based on the daughter's clear discomfort and the nature of therapy confidentiality, the parent might not be entirely right here.\n"
