I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the father) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as his daughter. The father's daughter, Ashley, is against it, thinking it invades her privacy. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay. The father wants to do family therapy but the daughter refuses to have sessions with him or his wife present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The father found a therapist for Ashley a year ago through their hospital. Now he wants to see Karla too. The daughter objects, citing privacy concerns. The father argues that Karla confirmed there's no conflict, and he sees it as beneficial for family therapy. The wife also thinks he's in the wrong, but the therapist is okay with it.\n\nPrivacy is a big issue here. Even though the therapist says it's fine, the daughter might feel uncomfortable sharing things if her parent is also a client. There's a potential for boundary issues. Therapists usually have strict confidentiality, but the daughter might feel that having her parent involved could somehow affect the trust in therapy. The father's comparison to a surgeon is a bit simplistic\u2014therapists deal with personal, emotional issues which are different from physical surgeries. Family therapy could be a solution, but the daughter refuses that as well.\n\nThe father is pushing back against what he sees as irrational anger, but maybe the daughter's feelings are valid. The father might not be considering her emotional perspective enough. Even if the therapist is okay, the daughter's discomfort matters. The father's approach could be seen as dismissive of her feelings, which might escalate the conflict. The therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's consent is also crucial. Maybe the father isn't respecting her autonomy here. So, while the therapist's okay is a point in his favor, the daughter's privacy concerns are significant. The answer might hinge on whether the father is acknowledging her feelings or just overriding them for his own needs.\n"
