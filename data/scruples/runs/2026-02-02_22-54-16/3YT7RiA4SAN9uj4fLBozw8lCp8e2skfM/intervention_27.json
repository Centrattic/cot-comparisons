I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The parent approached Karla and she agreed to see them too. But Ashley is upset about it, feeling it's a privacy breach. The parent argues it's similar to a family having the same surgeon and that Karla is the only therapist they trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical guidelines for therapists. In many places, therapists can see multiple family members, but there are boundaries. The key factors are whether there's a conflict of interest, potential for boundary violations, and if the therapist can maintain impartiality. The therapist here, Karla, says it's okay. But the parent is not a client yet, so the therapist's assessment matters. However, the daughter's feelings about privacy are significant. \n\nThe daughter might feel her private issues are being shared, even if the therapist maintains confidentiality. The parent's argument about not rewarding the daughter's anger or territorial behavior is a point, but the daughter's emotional reaction needs to be respected. Also, the parent wants to use this as a way to introduce family therapy, but the daughter refuses family sessions with the parent and wife present. \n\nThe parent's motivation is to have a trusted therapist and possibly improve family dynamics. But the daughter's discomfort could lead to her feeling pressured or losing trust in Karla. Even if Karla approves, the parent should consider the daughter's perspective and maybe seek an alternative therapist to avoid family tension. \n\nSo, while the parent's intentions are good, the potential for boundary issues in the therapeutic relationship and the daughter's right to privacy are important. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the therapist approves and the parent's reasoning is reasonable. But there's a strong argument that the parent is ignoring the daughter's feelings, which complicates it. However, the therapist's okay gives it some legitimacy. I think the correct answer is B.\n"
