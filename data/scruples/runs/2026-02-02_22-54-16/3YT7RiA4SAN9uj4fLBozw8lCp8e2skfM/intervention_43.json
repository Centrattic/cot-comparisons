I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The situation involves a military family where the parent introduced Ashley to Karla, a therapist they met through the on-base hospital. Ashley started with group sessions and later moved to one-on-one. Now Karla has her own practice and the parent wants to be her patient too.\n\nThe daughter is against it, citing privacy concerns. The parent acknowledges patient confidentiality and compares it to a shared surgeon, suggesting that the therapy setting is a professional one. The therapist Karla says it's fine, so there's no professional objection. The parent's wife and daughter think the parent is at fault (AITA), but the parent feels they're justified because the therapist agrees.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Therapists are trained to handle multiple clients in the same household, but they must ensure there's no conflict of interest. The key here is that Karla has assessed the situation and said it's okay. That implies she's confident there's no overlap that would compromise her ability to serve both clients. \n\nThe daughter's concern is about privacy. Even though the parent knows much about her life, the daughter might feel that sharing in a therapeutic setting is different. The parent is right about confidentiality, but the daughter's emotional reaction suggests she feels her privacy is being invaded. The parent is trying to push through, which could be seen as dismissive of the daughter's feelings, but they do mention wanting to respect her feelings while not giving in to anger or territorial behavior. \n\nFrom a family therapy perspective, having a shared therapist could be a way to introduce family sessions, which the parent is interested in. However, the daughter is resistant to any sessions with family present. The parent might be using their own desire for family therapy as a reason to proceed, but the daughter's refusal to include family in therapy could mean that this approach is premature. \n\nThe parent's reasoning is that if Karla is the only therapist they trust, and she's okay with it, then it's acceptable. The daughter's perspective is about personal boundaries. The parent is in a position of authority and might not realize the emotional impact on Ashley. Even though the therapist says it's fine, the daughter's emotional response is valid and should be considered. \n\nBut the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent is acting on their own need for therapy and hasn't forced the daughter to do anything. The daughter's privacy is legally protected by confidentiality, which the parent is aware of. The therapist's approval is a key point here. Ethically, if the therapist can maintain professional boundaries and ensure both clients' needs are met, then it's acceptable. However, the daughter's emotional reaction might stem from a deeper need for independence or fear of judgment. \n\nSo the parent isn't necessarily wrong, but they might be overlooking the daughter's emotional needs. The answer seems to depend on whether the parent is respecting the daughter's feelings beyond just the logistical aspects. Since the parent is trying to balance respect and not rewarding irrational behavior, and the therapist is okay with it, the parent might not be in the wrong. However, it's important to consider the daughter's comfort and find a solution that respects her while also addressing the parent's needs. Maybe suggesting an alternative therapist for the parent could be a way to compromise, but the parent feels that Karla is the best choice. \n\nIn the end, the therapist's professional judgment is a major factor here. If Karla is comfortable managing both clients without conflict, then the parent isn't in the wrong. The daughter's feelings are important, but if the parent's actions don't breach confidentiality and are professionally managed, the parent isn't at fault. The answer is likely B for No.\n"
