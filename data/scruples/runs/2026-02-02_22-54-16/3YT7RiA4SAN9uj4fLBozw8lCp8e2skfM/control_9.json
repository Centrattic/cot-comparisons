I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, but the therapist is okay. The parent argues that the therapist isn't the problem, and that family therapy could help since the daughter refuses to have sessions with them. The wife also thinks the parent is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager who might value her privacy more, especially if she's going to therapy. Sharing a therapist with a parent could make her feel that her privacy is being invaded. Even though the parent might know a lot already, the daughter might feel that the therapist should be a safe space where she can talk freely without worrying about the parent finding out. The parent mentions patient confidentiality, but maybe the daughter still feels uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent wants to use the therapist they trust, and the therapist is okay with it. The parent also sees it as an opportunity for family therapy. But the key issue here is the daughter's consent and comfort. Therapy is a personal process, and if the daughter is against it, the parent might be overstepping. The parent is insisting despite the daughter's objections, which could be seen as dismissing her feelings. The parent compares it to a surgeon treating the whole family, but that's a different context where the surgeon isn't also the therapist. The therapist's role involves trust and confidentiality, which might be compromised if the daughter feels her privacy is at risk. The wife supporting the daughter's stance might indicate that the parent isn't considering the daughter's needs enough. So the parent could be in the wrong for not respecting the daughter's boundaries.\n"
