I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The situation involves the daughter being upset about this, while the therapist, Karla, is okay with it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter started seeing Karla first, and the parent approached the therapist about joining. The daughter feels it's a breach of privacy, which is a valid concern. Therapists typically have boundaries about sharing clients' information, so having a parent also in therapy with the same provider could complicate that. Even though the parent mentions patient confidentiality, the daughter might still feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe parent argues that it's similar to a surgeon seeing both the patient and the parent, but there's a difference between medical and therapeutic relationships. Therapy often involves more personal, sensitive issues, and the therapeutic alliance relies heavily on trust and confidentiality. If the daughter feels her privacy is compromised, that could affect her willingness to open up.\n\nThe parent wants to use this as a way to introduce family therapy, but the daughter refuses sessions with the parent and spouse present. The therapist's agreement is important, but the daughter's feelings shouldn't be dismissed just because the therapist approves. The parent might be overlooking the daughter's emotional needs here. The daughter's anger could stem from feeling that her privacy isn't respected, especially if she's already in therapy dealing with personal issues.\n\nThe parent also mentions not finding a good reason from the daughter but that might be because the daughter isn't articulating her feelings well. However, the parent's approach could be seen as disregarding the daughter's boundaries, which is a key aspect of respecting her autonomy. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the parent should consider the daughter's perspective more carefully. It might be better to seek a different therapist for the parent to avoid conflict and ensure the daughter feels safe in her therapy sessions.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but there are valid concerns from the daughter's side. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since the daughter's privacy and comfort are at stake, and the parent is pushing despite the daughter's objections, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A), or maybe not. Wait, but the therapist is okay with it. The parent is following the therapist's advice, which complicates things. But the daughter's feelings are still important. The parent might be in the right in thinking it's a good therapeutic approach, but the daughter's autonomy should be respected. So maybe the answer is AITA? Hmm. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (not). I think the answer is that the parent is not in the wrong (B) because they're seeking therapy with a trusted professional, but the daughter's concerns are valid. However, the parent might not be the one at fault here. Alternatively, maybe the parent is in the wrong because they're disregarding the daughter's feelings. It's a tough call. The therapist's approval is there, but the daughter's feelings are still valid. So the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they need to handle the situation more sensitively. Given the options, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because they followed the therapist's advice and have their own reasons, but the daughter's feelings are still a factor. Wait, but the key is whether they're in the wrong. If the daughter's privacy is being breached, but the therapist says it's okay, then perhaps the parent isn't in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B.\n"
