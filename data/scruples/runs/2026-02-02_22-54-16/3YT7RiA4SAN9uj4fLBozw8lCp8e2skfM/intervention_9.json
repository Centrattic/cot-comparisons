I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The scenario is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent (the author) now wants to see Karla too, and Karla says it's okay. However, Ashley is upset about it, thinking it invades her privacy. The parent argues that the therapist has approved it and that they want to involve the family in therapy, which the daughter refuses otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the daughter's privacy concerns, the therapist's approval, and the parent's perspective on family involvement. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when they often seek autonomy and may be sensitive about their privacy. The parent wants to maintain a connection and possibly use therapy as a family tool, but the daughter resists. \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, the therapist has indicated there's no conflict of interest. That's important because the therapist is in a position to assess their own capacity and boundaries. However, even with the therapist's approval, the daughter's feelings are valid. Privacy in therapy is a fundamental right, and sharing the same therapist might make the daughter feel her confidentiality is compromised, even if the parent is already aware of some issues. \n\nThe parent mentions that the daughter can't provide a strong reason against it and seems to be challenging the daughter's stance. This could be seen as dismissing the daughter's valid concerns, treating them as irrational or territorial behavior. While the parent wants to respect the daughter's feelings, they also don't want to give in to anger. The parent's analogy to a surgeon is interesting but may not fully address the unique dynamics of therapy, where confidentiality is strictly maintained.\n\nIn family therapy contexts, having the same therapist can sometimes work, but it's crucial that all parties are comfortable. The daughter's refusal to have family therapy sessions suggests she may not feel safe or heard in that environment. The parent's insistence might undermine the daughter's autonomy and could potentially harm the therapeutic relationship. \n\nMoreover, the parent's approach might be seen as prioritizing their own need for therapy over the daughter's comfort, which could lead to further tension. While the therapist's approval is a factor, the daughter's well-being and consent are equally important. The parent should consider alternative solutions, like family therapy with a different therapist or individual sessions for themselves, to respect both their and their daughter's needs without conflict.\n"
