I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author, the parent, met Karla through their military base hospital and referred Ashley to her. Now that Karla is independent, the parent wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but Ashley is upset about privacy.\n\nI need to consider the ethical guidelines for therapists. Usually, therapists have boundaries about treating family members of existing clients. There could be conflicts of interest, like dual relationships, which are often discouraged because they can complicate the therapeutic relationship. But the therapist here says it's fine. However, the daughter is uncomfortable. \n\nThe parent argues that Karla's approval makes it okay. But even if the therapist is okay, the daughter's privacy concerns are valid. Sharing the same therapist might lead to information being shared between them, which could breach confidentiality from Ashley's perspective. The parent mentions patient confidentiality, but maybe they're not considering how the daughter feels about discussing personal issues in front of the parent.\n\nAlso, the parent wants to use this as a way to start family therapy, but Ashley refuses. The parent might be pushing their own agenda rather than respecting Ashley's boundaries. The daughter's reaction could indicate she needs a safe space without her parent's presence. The parent's analogy about a surgeon doesn't quite fit because therapy involves more personal and emotional information, which is different from a medical procedure.\n\nSo, even if the therapist is okay with it, the parent's decision might not respect Ashley's boundaries and privacy. The therapist's approval doesn't necessarily override the daughter's feelings. The parent might be in the wrong by not adequately respecting Ashley's comfort level and privacy concerns, even if the therapist thinks it's fine. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
