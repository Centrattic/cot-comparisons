I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist that their daughter is seeing. The daughter is upset about this, feeling it's a breach of her privacy. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries in therapy. Therapists usually have strict confidentiality rules. If the daughter has a therapist, and the parent is now also a client, could that create a conflict? Even though Karla said it's fine, maybe there are professional guidelines that make this problematic. Like, if the therapist is treating both family members, there could be issues with dual relationships. The American Psychological Association has ethical standards about that. Dual relationships can be a problem if they impair the therapist's objectivity or exploit the patient. But if the therapist is comfortable and the daughter is not, maybe the issue is more about the daughter's feelings.\n\nThe parent is trying to use the same therapist as a way to maybe get the daughter to do family therapy, which she currently refuses. The daughter might feel that having her parent involved in the same therapist's sessions undermines her confidentiality and trust. Even if the parent argues that they already know a lot, the daughter might feel that the therapist's perception of her could be influenced by the parent's input. That could make the daughter less likely to be open in sessions, which would be counterproductive.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is coming from a place of wanting to seek help from someone they trust and believe is effective. The therapist's agreement might suggest that she's confident in handling the situation without conflict. But the parent should also respect the daughter's feelings. The daughter's anger might not be irrational; it's about her personal boundaries and the therapeutic relationship. The parent might be dismissing the daughter's valid concerns by challenging her to give reasons, which could make the daughter feel unheard.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong in seeking therapy from someone they trust, but they might be disregarding the daughter's emotional needs and boundaries. The key here is whether the parent is respecting the daughter's perspective. If the daughter is uncomfortable, the parent should consider alternative solutions instead of pushing forward, even if the therapist is okay with it. The parent's intent might be good, but the approach could be causing more harm by invalidating the daughter's feelings. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not adequately respecting the daughter's concerns, even if the therapist is fine with it.\n"
