I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The situation is that the daughter is upset about it, but the therapist, Karla, is okay with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager who might value her privacy a lot, especially with a therapist. Therapy is supposed to be a safe space, and sharing the same therapist as a parent could make her feel uncomfortable or like her privacy is invaded. The author mentions that Ashley is \"troubled\" and has been through a lot, so maybe she's already in a vulnerable state. The daughter's resistance might stem from needing to feel that her personal issues aren't shared with her parents, even if she knows confidentiality laws exist. Teenagers often want independence, so this could be a way of asserting control over their own life.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a good relationship with Karla, trusts her, and sees it as a way to possibly start family therapy. The therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's feelings are also valid. The author is trying to be inclusive and maybe help the family, but the approach might be causing more tension. The author mentions that Ashley refuses family therapy with them present, so maybe using the same therapist isn't the right way to address that. It might not actually resolve the issue and could make Ashley pull away more.\n\nThe wife and daughter disagree with the author's decision, so there's a family dynamic here. The author is trying to balance their need for therapy with respecting Ashley's feelings. However, pushing through despite her objections might not be the best approach. Even if Karla says it's okay, the daughter's emotional response should be taken seriously. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but they could be mishandling the situation by not fully respecting Ashley's boundaries. The key is whether the author is overstepping or not. The answer might depend on balancing professional advice with the daughter's emotional well-being.\n"
