I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about privacy, but the therapist, Karla, says it's okay. The parent is trying to be inclusive and even mentions family therapy, but the daughter refuses sessions with family present.\n\nFirst, the parent approached the therapist first, checked for conflicts, and the therapist agreed. That's good because it's about professional boundaries. The daughter's main concern is privacy. While patient confidentiality is a thing, the parent might already know a lot, but the daughter feels it's a breach. The parent argues that it's similar to a surgeon treating both, which is a valid analogy. However, therapy is different because it's more personal and confidential. \n\nThe daughter is a teenager, which can be a time of heightened sensitivity around privacy. The parent wants to respect her feelings but also not give in to what they see as irrational behavior. The parent's intention seems genuine\u2014to get help and maybe start family therapy. But the daughter's refusal to have family in sessions might be a red flag. The therapist's approval is important, but it's also about the daughter's comfort. \n\nIs the parent wrong? They aren't violating confidentiality since they asked the therapist first. But they might not be considering the daughter's emotional state enough. However, the parent isn't forcing it, just expressing their intent. The daughter's reaction could be part of her issues, but the parent is trying to be proactive. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
