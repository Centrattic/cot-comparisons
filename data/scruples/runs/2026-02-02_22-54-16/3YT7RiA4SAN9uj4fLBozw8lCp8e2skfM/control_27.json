I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The author, a parent, met Dr. Karla through their job and felt she was a good fit for the daughter. The daughter started with group sessions and then went to one-on-one. Now Dr. Karla is independent, and the parent wants to see her too, but the daughter is upset about it.\n\nThe parent argues that the therapist said it's okay and that they need to respect their daughter's privacy, but also don't want to give in to her anger. They mention that the daughter is a \"troubled\" teen and that family therapy might help, but the daughter refuses sessions with the parent and spouse present. The wife and daughter think the parent is \"taking the AITA\" (asking for the wrong), but the therapist supports it.\n\nSo, the main points are: therapist consents, daughter is upset about privacy, parent wants to use the same trusted professional. \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, therapists usually have boundaries about treating close family members of their existing patients to avoid conflicts of interest. However, the therapist here said it's okay. But the daughter's privacy is a concern. Even if the therapist allows it, the daughter might feel her privacy is invaded. The parent might not realize how intrusive this feels to the daughter. Also, the parent is pushing back against the daughter's feelings, seeing it as irrational, which could be dismissing her valid concerns about privacy. \n\nIn some cases, family therapy with a different therapist could be better to maintain boundaries. The parent's reasoning about a surgeon analogy might not apply here because a therapist deals with more personal and sensitive information. The daughter's refusal to have family sessions with her might be due to trust issues or feeling overwhelmed. \n\nSo, while the therapist's approval is a point in the parent's favor, the daughter's feelings about privacy and the potential for conflict might mean the parent is overstepping. The parent might not be considering the daughter's perspective enough, thinking it's irrational when it's actually about personal boundaries. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong by not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns despite the therapist's approval.\n"
