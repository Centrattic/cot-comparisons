I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent, let's call them Dad, introduced Ashley to Karla. Now Karla is an independent therapist, and Dad wants to see her too. The daughter is upset about this, feeling it's a breach of her privacy. Dad argues that Karla agreed it's fine, and he wants family therapy since Ashley refuses to do sessions with family present. The wife and daughter think the Dad is in the wrong (TA), but Karla says it's okay.\n\nHmm. So, the main points here are about confidentiality and professional boundaries. Therapists have strict rules about confidentiality. Even if Karla is okay with seeing both, sharing information between the parent and the therapist about the daughter could be a problem. The daughter might feel her privacy is invaded, which is a valid concern. Teenagers often feel this way when their parent is involved in their therapy. \n\nDad's reasoning is that the therapist agreed, but the daughter's privacy is a key legal and ethical aspect. Therapists are supposed to maintain confidentiality between client and therapist. If Karla shares information from Ashley's sessions with the Dad, that's a breach. Even if Karla is okay with it, the professional standards might not allow that. Also, involving both parent and child in the same therapist's practice could create conflicts, especially if the therapist needs to take sides or if the child feels pressured.\n\nOn the other hand, the Dad wants family therapy, which could be beneficial. But if Ashley refuses to have family sessions, forcing her to share the therapist might not be the best approach. The daughter's resistance could be due to feeling that her private issues are being exposed. \n\nThe therapist's role is to ensure that both parties understand the boundaries. If Karla is comfortable with both, but the daughter isn't, maybe the issue is more about the daughter's feelings of privacy. The Dad might not realize how serious patient confidentiality is. Even if he's not getting specific information, the fact that he's seeing the same therapist might make Ashley feel like her private matters are being discussed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might not be wrong in wanting to see a trusted therapist, but the way they handle the situation could infringe on the daughter's rights. The therapist should have made sure that boundaries are clear. Since the daughter is upset, and privacy is a major concern, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A) because they're ignoring the daughter's privacy concerns despite the therapist's approval. However, if the therapist is professional and maintains confidentiality, maybe it's not the parent's fault. But given the daughter's strong reaction and the potential for privacy issues, the parent might be in the wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
