I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about this, citing privacy concerns. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parent has a good reason to trust Karla\u2014maybe they're experienced and the therapist is effective. The parent wants to maintain family therapy and has been included in the daughter's progress before, which Karla agreed to. But the daughter is a teenager, which is a time when they often seek autonomy and privacy. The parent is right to respect confidentiality, but also wants to engage in family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with family present. \n\nThe daughter's anger might stem from feeling her privacy is invaded, even if the parent isn't supposed to know everything. The parent argues that the therapist is okay with it, so maybe there's no professional conflict. However, there's a risk of the therapist's impartiality if they have to manage both parent and child issues. But since the parent and therapist already have a relationship through the daughter, maybe that's manageable.\n\nThe parent is trying to bridge the gap with family therapy but the daughter resists. The parent isn't forcing the daughter but is standing firm, which could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. But on the other hand, the parent is seeking help for themselves, which is valid. \n\nThe key points are whether the therapist is ethically okay with seeing both, which they are, and whether the parent is overstepping by not giving the daughter space. But the parent isn't violating privacy directly, and the daughter's refusal to engage in family therapy complicates things. \n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong here. They're seeking support and the therapist approves. The daughter's feelings are valid, but the parent has a right to choose their own therapist. So answer B.\n"
