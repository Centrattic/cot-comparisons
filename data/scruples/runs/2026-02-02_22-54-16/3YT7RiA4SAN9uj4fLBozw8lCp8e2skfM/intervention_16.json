I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about privacy, but the therapist says it's okay. The parent argues it's similar to sharing a surgeon and sees it as a way to involve the family in therapy.\n\nFirst, the parent's intentions seem valid. They trust the therapist and want to maintain that relationship. The therapist has given consent, which is important because professionals should guide such decisions. The parent is also trying to engage the daughter in family therapy since she's resistant otherwise. However, the daughter's privacy concerns are legitimate. Even if the parent knows a lot already, sharing the same therapist could create discomfort or a conflict of interest, especially if the daughter feels her confidentiality is compromised. The therapist's role is to maintain boundaries, so while they might not see a conflict, the daughter's feelings are still valid. The parent might not be in the wrong for their intention, but they need to consider the daughter's feelings more and maybe explore family therapy with a different therapist to respect her boundaries. So the answer is B, but with nuances.\n"
