I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The parent, let's call them Parent, has a daughter Ashley who's been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The Parent met Karla through the military hospital and sent Ashley to her group sessions. Now Karla works independently, and Parent wants to start seeing her too. Karla agrees, but Ashley is against it, citing privacy concerns. The Parent argues that Karla has no issues with it and that it's like having the same surgeon. They also mention that Ashley refuses family therapy otherwise.\n\nSo, the main points are: Parent's desire to see the same therapist, Karla's approval, Ashley's objection based on privacy, and the Parent's reasoning.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, therapists often avoid treating family members of current clients to prevent conflicts of interest. Even if Karla says it's okay, there could be professional guidelines against it. But the Parent is taking Karla's word as sufficient. \n\nEthically, the daughter's privacy is a significant consideration. Even if the Parent knows a lot, patient confidentiality between Ashley and Karla should be respected. The Parent's insistence might be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter feels her privacy is being invaded. The comparison to a surgeon doesn't hold because surgeons can treat multiple family members without the same privacy concerns as therapists.\n\nThe Parent also wants to use this as an introduction to family therapy, but Ashley refuses sessions with parents present. Forcing the issue might not be the best approach for Ashley's comfort and therapy effectiveness. \n\nThe Parent's stance is that Karla's approval is enough, but professional standards might require avoiding such situations regardless of the client's or therapist's comfort. The daughter's feelings about privacy and autonomy are valid, especially in adolescence. The Parent's actions might be seen as undermining Ashley's autonomy and privacy for their own convenience.\n\nSo, considering all that, the Parent might be in the wrong because they're not respecting the daughter's privacy and there's a potential conflict of interest that the therapist might not fully recognize or handle appropriately. Even if Karla agrees, the ethical implications and the daughter's distress suggest the Parent should reconsider.\n"
