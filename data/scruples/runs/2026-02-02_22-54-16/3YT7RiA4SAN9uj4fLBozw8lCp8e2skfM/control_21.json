I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as his daughter. The daughter doesn't like the idea, thinking it invades her privacy. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, and teenagers often value their privacy a lot. Even if the father is trying to be involved, the daughter might feel that sharing a therapist is a breach of her personal space. Patient confidentiality is a big deal, and she might feel uncomfortable knowing her father could find out things she's not ready to share. The father mentions she can't give a reason, but maybe she's justifiably worried about her privacy. \n\nThen there's the father's side. He's been through a lot, and he wants support. He also sees this as a way to do family therapy since his daughter refuses to have sessions with them. But the therapist's approval doesn't necessarily mean it's the right call. The father might not realize how much the daughter needs her privacy, especially if she's already troubled. The therapist agreeing to see him might be more about being accommodating rather than considering the daughter's feelings.\n\nEthically, therapists usually avoid dual relationships to prevent conflicts of interest. Having both parent and child see the same therapist could complicate the therapeutic process. The daughter might feel pressured or unable to discuss certain issues if her father is also a client. The father might not see this because he's focused on his own needs and wants to be involved, but it could actually hinder the daughter's progress.\n\nThe mother also thinks the father is in the wrong, which adds another layer. The father's argument about the surgeon analogy is weak because surgery is a different context\u2014there's no confidentiality issue there. Therapy involves personal, sensitive information, so the comparison doesn't hold. \n\nIn family therapy, the therapist would work with the family as a unit under specific conditions, but having the same therapist separately might not be the same. The father might be misinterpreting Karla's openness as a green light without considering the daughter's valid concerns. \n\nSo, even though the therapist agrees, the daughter's privacy and feelings are important. The father might not be in the wrong in a strict sense, but he's ignoring his daughter's boundaries, which could be problematic. The answer might hinge on whether respecting the daughter's privacy is more important than the father's desire for shared therapy. Given that the daughter is resistant and the situation could cause more issues, the father's actions might be seen as overstepping, making him at least partially at fault.\n"
