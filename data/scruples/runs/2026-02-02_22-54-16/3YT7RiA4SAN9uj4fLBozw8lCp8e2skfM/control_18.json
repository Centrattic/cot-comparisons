I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, thinking it's a privacy breach. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. Teenagers often value their privacy, especially in therapy. They might feel that their personal issues are being discussed with someone their parent is now also consulting. Even though the parent knows the therapist is good, the daughter's discomfort is valid. There's a potential conflict of interest here\u2014maybe the therapist might not be able to be completely unbiased if both parent and child are clients. Also, family therapy might be a better approach here, as the parent mentions the daughter refuses family sessions. \n\nBut the parent argues that the therapist approved it, so maybe there's a professional opinion that it's acceptable. However, the daughter's refusal to have family therapy sessions suggests there are underlying issues they haven't addressed. The parent might be dismissing the daughter's legitimate privacy concerns by comparing it to a surgeon treating multiple family members, which isn't the same because therapy involves more personal and emotional aspects.\n\nThe daughter's resistance could be due to feeling that her trust is being violated. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the parent should consider the daughter's feelings. The daughter being a \"troubled\" teen might mean she's already dealing with a lot, and this could add to her stress. The parent's approach might be seen as overstepping, especially if it's done without fully addressing the daughter's concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intent is to seek help for themselves and possibly encourage family therapy. But the method of using the same therapist might not be the best. The therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's emotional response is also a key factor. The parent should weigh the daughter's feelings against their own needs. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent has valid reasons and the therapist's support, the daughter's privacy concerns are significant. The parent might be disregarding her feelings by pushing forward, which could damage trust. So, the parent is likely in the wrong here. The answer is A.\n"
