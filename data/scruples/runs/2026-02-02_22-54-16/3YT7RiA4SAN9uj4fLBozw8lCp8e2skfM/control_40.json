I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author, a parent, met Karla through the military hospital and referred her to Ashley. Now, Karla works independently and both the parent and daughter are currently seeing her. The daughter is against the parent seeing Karla, citing privacy concerns. The parent argues that Karla has approved it, and they want to start family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with them present.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the parent is crossing boundaries by wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter's concern is about privacy. The parent is trying to respect the daughter's feelings but also sees no issue, pointing out that Karla agrees and it's similar to a surgeon operating on both family members.\n\nTherapeutic boundaries are important. Therapists usually have guidelines to prevent conflicts of interest between family members. Even if the therapist says it's okay, there might be ethical considerations. For example, if the parent and daughter discuss the same issues, the therapist could become a mediator in their family dynamics, which might not be ideal. Also, the daughter's privacy is a valid concern; the therapist might share information that affects the parent's perception of the daughter, which could strain their relationship.\n\nThe parent mentions that Karla is on board, but the therapist's approval doesn't necessarily override ethical guidelines. The American Psychological Association has standards about multiple relationships. If Karla is treating both family members, it could create a conflict of interest, especially if the parent wants to involve family therapy. The daughter might feel coerced or that her privacy is violated, which could harm the therapeutic relationship.\n\nThe parent's reasoning about family therapy is a good point, but the daughter's refusal to have the parent present suggests that she may not be ready for that. Forcing the parent to see the same therapist might not be the best approach. The parent might be ignoring the daughter's emotional needs by pushing this, even if Karla says it's okay. \n\nIn terms of the parent's argument about a surgeon analogy, that's a bit of a stretch because surgeons don't discuss personal psychological issues, and therapy involves deep personal information. The parent might not be considering the daughter's perspective adequately, treating her anger as irrational but maybe not understanding the underlying reasons. The daughter's trauma and being a \"troubled\" teen could mean she's sensitive to privacy issues.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent might be overstepping. Even if the therapist approves, the daughter's feelings of privacy and potential coercion are valid. The parent should probably respect the daughter's wishes to maintain trust and avoid complicating the therapy process. Therefore, the answer would be AITA, but the parent is in the wrong because they're disregarding the daughter's privacy concerns and possibly creating ethical issues in therapy.\n"
