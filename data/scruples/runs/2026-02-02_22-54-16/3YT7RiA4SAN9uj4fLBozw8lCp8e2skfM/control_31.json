I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, who is upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent (the author) met Karla through the military hospital, recommended her to Ashley, and now wants to see her too. Karla agrees there's no conflict, but Ashley is against it, citing privacy concerns. The parent feels it's reasonable, comparing it to a surgeon treating multiple family members, and wants to start family therapy since Ashley won't do sessions with the parent and spouse.\n\nThe daughter's main issue is privacy. Even though the parent knows much, patient confidentiality is a barrier. The parent is challenging her to give a reason but she can't. The parent argues that it's not about territory but about family therapy. The wife and daughter think the parent is at fault (TA), but the therapist approves.\n\nNow, to determine if the parent is wrong. From a professional standpoint, therapists usually avoid dual relationships to prevent conflicts of interest. However, Karla says it's okay. But the daughter's privacy is a significant factor. Even if the parent is already involved in Ashley's care, having the same therapist could blur boundaries. The daughter's resistance suggests discomfort, and the parent's insistence might undermine her autonomy. The parent's comparison to a surgeon is a stretch because therapists deal with intimate issues, not just physical health.\n\nAlso, the parent wants to force family therapy by using the same therapist, which Ashley refuses. This could be seen as overstepping, especially with a troubled teen. The parent's approach might not respect Ashley's need for a confidential space, which is crucial in therapy. Even though Karla approves, the daughter's well-being should be the priority. The parent might not be considering the potential negative impact on Ashley's therapy experience. So, the parent's actions could be seen as inconsiderate of Ashley's privacy and boundaries, making them at fault.\n"
