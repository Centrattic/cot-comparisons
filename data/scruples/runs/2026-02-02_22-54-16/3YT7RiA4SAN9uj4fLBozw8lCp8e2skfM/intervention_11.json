I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the daughter (Ashley) has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The parent (the author) introduced her to the group sessions initially, and then Ashley started individual sessions. Now, Dr. Karla works independently, and the parent wants to be seen by her too. Dr. Karla says it's okay and there's no conflict. But Ashley is upset about it, feels it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that they already know a lot about Ashley's issues and that the therapist is okay with it. The parent also mentions that Ashley refuses family therapy and wants to use this as a step toward it. The parent's spouse and daughter think the parent is in the wrong, but the parent feels supported by the therapist.\n\nSo, the main points are: the parent is seeking the same therapist because they trust her, the therapist approves, but the daughter is against it. The parent is trying to balance respecting Ashley's feelings versus not giving in to what they see as irrational behavior.\n\nI need to consider ethical and practical aspects. In therapy, confidentiality is key. Even if the parent knows a lot, the daughter might feel that sharing personal issues with someone who also knows her parent's issues could affect the therapeutic relationship. It might create tension if the therapist has to navigate both parent and child's sessions. The daughter might feel less comfortable opening up if she thinks her parent could find out. Also, family therapy is structured differently and might require separate arrangements. The parent's intention to use this as an entry into family therapy is a good point, but maybe the approach is causing resistance because the daughter is already uncomfortable. The therapist's agreement is important, but the parent's decision to proceed might not consider the daughter's valid privacy concerns. The daughter's reaction could be a mix of anger and fear, which the parent is dismissing as \"territorial behavior,\" but it's possible that the daughter has legitimate reasons tied to her past experiences. The parent might be overestimating how much they already know and underestimating the impact on the daughter's trust in therapy. So, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they might not be considering the daughter's emotional needs adequately. However, since the therapist is okay with it and the parent's intention is to seek help, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with a note that the parent should be more sensitive to the daughter's feelings.\n"
