I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person (the father in this case) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as his daughter, Ashley. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the father isn't the therapist, but he recommended Ashley to Karla, who was working at their on-base hospital. Ashley then started with Karla's group sessions and later moved to one-on-one. Now Karla is independent, and the father wants to see her too. He checked with Karla, who said there's no conflict of interest. The daughter is upset, thinking it's a privacy breach. The father argues that since he's already involved in Ashley's progress and they've shared info before, it's not a big deal. He also brings up the surgeon analogy and wants to use this as a way to introduce family therapy, which Ashley refuses. The wife and daughter think he's in the wrong (TA), but the father trusts Karla's professional opinion.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the therapist's approval, the daughter's privacy concerns, and the father's reasoning. I need to figure out if the father is overstepping by using the same therapist. \n\nTherapists usually have strict boundaries to maintain patient confidentiality. Even if Karla is okay with both, the daughter might feel her privacy is compromised. But the father has a legitimate reason to seek help and Karla has assessed that it's manageable. \n\nThe daughter's resistance could be because she feels the therapist is her personal space. The father might be right in wanting to use a trusted professional, but he needs to consider her feelings. However, the therapist isn't breaching confidentiality by seeing him. The key is whether Karla can handle both without it affecting the daughter's treatment. Since Karla said there's no conflict, maybe the father isn't wrong. \n\nBut maybe the daughter's perspective is valid. Even if the father is allowed, it's about how the daughter feels. The father should respect that, even if he doesn't fully agree. However, the question is about the author being in the wrong. If the therapist is okay, and the father isn't violating any rules, then technically he's not in the wrong. But the daughter's feelings are important too. The answer might depend on balancing professional ethics and personal feelings. \n\nI think the father isn't in the wrong because he consulted the therapist and got approval. But he should still be sensitive to his daughter's feelings. Since the therapist is fine with it, and there's no professional violation, the answer might lean towards B (No). However, the daughter's right to privacy is a significant point. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the therapist's okay is a key point. So likely answer is B.\n"
