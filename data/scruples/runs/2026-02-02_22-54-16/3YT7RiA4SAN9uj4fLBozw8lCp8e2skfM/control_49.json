I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent (author) met Karla through the military hospital, thought she was good, and even referred Ashley to her. Now Karla works independently, and the parent wants to see her too. The daughter objects, citing privacy concerns. The parent argues that the therapist approved it, and maybe even see it as family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with the family.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? Let's break it down. The daughter's main issue is privacy. Even though the parent might know a lot, there's confidential info the therapist can't share. The parent might be overstepping by wanting the same therapist, especially since Ashley is a teenager who might value her privacy more. The therapist's approval is there, but professional boundaries are important. Therapists often avoid treating family members of their patients to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain objectivity. Even if Karla said it's okay, there might be good reasons why therapists usually don't do that. The parent's pushback against Ashley's feelings could be seen as dismissing her valid concerns. On the other hand, the parent is trying to seek help and maybe improve family dynamics. But the daughter's right to privacy is significant here. The parent might not realize how intrusive this could feel to Ashley, even with good intentions. So, even though the therapist agrees, the parent's actions might be disregarding the daughter's feelings and professional boundaries. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
