I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe daughter, Ashley, has been seeing Therapist Karla for a year. The parent introduced her to Karla through a military base hospital connection. Now Karla works independently and is comfortable seeing the parent too. The daughter is upset about this, feeling it invades her privacy. The parent argues that Karla said it's okay and that they need the support, especially since family therapy isn't an option the daughter agrees to. The wife also thinks the parent is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider professional boundaries in therapy. Therapists are trained to manage these situations, and if Karla is okay with seeing both, that's a point in the parent's favor. However, the daughter's comfort is crucial. Even if the parent believes they know a lot, the daughter's privacy is protected by confidentiality. The parent might be overstepping if they're expecting information sharing that isn't appropriate.\n\nThe daughter's resistance could stem from feeling her privacy is compromised. While the parent wants to model healthy behavior and possibly engage in family therapy, the daughter's refusal to have sessions together complicates things. The parent might be dismissing the daughter's valid concerns as \"territorial\" without fully understanding her perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is seeking help for their own issues, which is reasonable. The therapist's approval suggests it's professionally acceptable. However, the parent should ensure that their involvement doesn't pressure the daughter or create discomfort. The key here is balancing the parent's needs with respecting the daughter's boundaries. If the parent is genuinely seeking therapy and the therapist agrees it's manageable, then it's not necessarily wrong. But the parent needs to be sensitive to the daughter's feelings and avoid creating a dynamic where the daughter feels her privacy is invaded. So, the answer hinges on whether the parent is respecting the daughter's boundaries despite the therapist's approval. If the parent is insistent without considering the daughter's valid concerns, they might be at fault. But if they're proceeding with the therapist's guidance and are open to the daughter's feelings, it's less so. Given the information, the parent might not be in the wrong if they're following professional advice and aren't coercive, but they need to be cautious. The answer is likely B (No), but with the caveat that they should handle it carefully.\n"
