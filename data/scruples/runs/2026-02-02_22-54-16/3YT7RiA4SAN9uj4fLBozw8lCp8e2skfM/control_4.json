I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The therapist, Karla, has been treating Ashley for a year and is now in private practice. The author thinks Karla is the best therapist and wants to go to her as well, but Ashley is upset about it. The parents believe they're not in the wrong (TA), but the daughter is angry, feeling it's a privacy breach. The parents argue that Karla said it's fine and that it's like having the same surgeon, but the daughter refuses family therapy sessions with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical boundaries in therapy. Therapists are supposed to maintain strict confidentiality for each client. Even if Karla is okay with it, the daughter might feel uncomfortable sharing personal issues if her parent is also a client. It could create a conflict of interest if the therapist has to navigate both the parent and child's sessions, possibly affecting the therapeutic dynamic for both. \n\nThe daughter's resistance is valid because she's a teenager who might already be protective of her privacy. Even if the parent knows a lot about her, there's still confidential information that can't be shared. The parent's reasoning about family therapy is a good point, but Ashley's refusal to have her parents present complicates things. If both go to Karla, the therapist might have to manage the family dynamics in a way that's not traditional family therapy, which could be less effective.\n\nAlso, the military context might mean the family has limited access to therapists, which adds pressure to use someone they trust. However, the main issue is the daughter's perception of privacy. The parent might not intend to invade her privacy, but the mere possibility could make her feel that way. It's important for the parent to respect her boundaries unless the therapist's judgment is clear and both parties are comfortable. \n\nSince Karla is an adult and has given consent, but the daughter is a minor (assuming she's a teenager), the parent might have more say. But even so, the daughter's feelings about privacy should be taken seriously. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parent has a right to seek therapy from a trusted professional, and the therapist has approved it. However, the daughter's perspective is also valid, so the parent should consider alternative options to respect her feelings without compromising their own mental health needs. But according to the scenario, the parent is trying to respect the daughter's feelings while also not rewarding her anger, so the parent's actions are justified. The therapist's approval is key here, as professionals are trained to handle such situations and determine if there's a conflict. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
