I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist as their daughter, but the daughter is upset about it. The parent argues that the therapist, Karla, has approved it and that they just want to start family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with the parent and spouse present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Therapists typically maintain confidentiality between the client and the therapist. If the daughter is a minor, the parent might have some rights regarding her care, but the daughter still has a right to privacy. However, the parent is an adult and can seek their own therapy. Karla, the therapist, says it's okay, which is important because the therapist is in a position to assess potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe daughter is upset, thinking it's a privacy breach. The parent acknowledges patient confidentiality but seems to think that since they already know a lot, it's not a big deal. But the daughter's feelings are valid here. Even if the parent knows some things, sharing the same therapist might make the daughter feel her private issues are being discussed in front of the parent. That's a common concern in therapy settings, especially with teens who are already struggling.\n\nThe parent's reasoning about family therapy is good, but the daughter is resistant. The parent wants to use this as a step towards family therapy, but if the daughter is not on board, it might backfire. The parent should consider the daughter's feelings more seriously. Just because the therapist says it's okay doesn't necessarily mean it's the best idea. The daughter's trust in therapy could be compromised if she feels her privacy isn't respected.\n\nAlso, comparing it to a surgeon is a bit of a stretch. Surgeons can operate on multiple family members without it being a conflict, but therapists deal with sensitive information that could affect family dynamics more directly. The parent might not realize how this could make the daughter feel, especially if she's already troubled. The parent needs to balance their own needs with the daughter's emotional well-being.\n\nIn summary, while the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because the therapist agrees, the daughter's right to privacy and emotional response should be a major consideration. The parent might be overstepping by not fully respecting the daughter's concerns. So, the answer is A\u2014it's a yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
