I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, thinking it's a breach of privacy. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parent is the one initiating the request, and the therapist says it's fine. The daughter is a teenager, which might mean she's more sensitive about privacy. The parent argues that the therapist is the only one they trust and that it's similar to a surgeon treating both family members. The parent also wants to involve the family in therapy since their daughter refuses to have family sessions otherwise.\n\nBut, from a professional standpoint, having the same therapist for both parent and child can be tricky. Therapists usually avoid dual relationships because it can create conflicts of interest. Even if Karla said it's okay, there might be underlying issues. The daughter's privacy is a big concern here. Even though the parent might know a lot about their daughter's issues, the therapist-patient confidentiality is paramount. The daughter might feel her private matters are being shared, which could damage trust.\n\nAlso, the parent is pushing back against the daughter's feelings, calling her behavior \"territorial\" and \"irrational.\" That could be minimizing the daughter's legitimate concerns. The daughter is described as troubled, so this might be a red flag. Maybe the parent isn't considering the daughter's emotional state properly. The parent's reasoning about family therapy is a good point, but the approach might be causing more harm than good.\n\nThe therapist's role here is important. Even if Karla is okay with it, she needs to ensure that both parties are comfortable and that there's no exploitation. The parent's insistence might pressure the daughter into an uncomfortable situation. The daughter's refusal to have family sessions with the parent present suggests there might be underlying tensions or issues that need to be addressed without the therapist being in both roles.\n\nSo, while the parent's intentions might be good, the action of using the same therapist could be problematic. It's important to respect the daughter's privacy and consider the potential for conflicts of interest. The parent might not be in the wrong from their perspective, but ethically and from a therapeutic standpoint, it's a gray area. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there are valid concerns raised by the daughter's feelings and the potential for professional boundaries to be crossed.\n"
