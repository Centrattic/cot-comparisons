I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the parent) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent approached Karla first, got her approval, but the daughter is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical guidelines for therapists. Multiple patients in the same family can sometimes be an issue because it complicates boundaries and confidentiality. But the therapist said it's okay, so maybe she's aware of the potential issues and is taking steps to handle them. However, the daughter's main concern is privacy. Even if the parent knows a lot already, the daughter might feel uncomfortable discussing personal issues in front of her parent or having the parent involved. \n\nThe parent argues that it's similar to a surgeon treating the whole family, but therapy is different. Therapists have strict confidentiality rules, and even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's feelings are valid. The parent mentions the daughter is \"troubled\" and refuses family therapy, so maybe seeing the same therapist is an attempt to bridge that gap. But if the daughter is resistant, forcing it might not be healthy. The parent is pushing back against the daughter's anger, thinking it's irrational, but teenagers often have strong feelings about privacy and autonomy. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the daughter's well-being. The therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's emotional response shouldn't be dismissed. The parent might not be in the wrong in terms of seeking therapy, but how they're handling the daughter's feelings could be problematic. They need to balance their own needs with respecting the daughter's boundaries. So maybe the answer is B, the parent isn't in the wrong, but there's a need for sensitivity towards the daughter's concerns.\n"
