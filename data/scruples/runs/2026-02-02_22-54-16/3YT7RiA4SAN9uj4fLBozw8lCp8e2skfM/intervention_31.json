I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is at fault. The main issue is that the parent (the author) wants to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay, but Ashley is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parent is a military person, which might mean a structured environment, but that's not directly relevant. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when privacy is important. The parent mentions that the therapist is inclusive and that they already know a lot about Ashley's issues. However, the parent is pushing back against Ashley's privacy concerns, using the surgeon analogy. \n\nI know that therapists have strict confidentiality rules, even for family members. So even if the parent is well-intentioned, having the same therapist could create conflicts. The daughter might feel her privacy is invaded, which is a valid concern. The parent argues that Karla has given her blessing, but the daughter's discomfort is still a factor. \n\nThe parent wants to use this as a way to do family therapy since Ashley refuses sessions with the family present. But maybe there are other ways to approach family therapy without sharing the same therapist. Also, the parent says they challenged Ashley to give a reason against it, but teens might not always articulate their feelings well. \n\nIn terms of professional ethics, therapists usually avoid dual relationships where they could have power over multiple family members. Even if Karla thinks it's fine, there might be ethical guidelines against it. The parent might not realize the potential for boundary issues. \n\nSo, while the parent's intentions are good (wanting support and family therapy), they might be overstepping Ashley's privacy. The daughter's concern about confidentiality is valid, and the parent isn't respecting that enough. Therefore, the author might be at fault here.\n"
