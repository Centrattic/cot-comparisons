I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter (Ashley) has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The author arranged for Ashley to start with Dr. Karla, and now the author wants to see her too. The therapist is okay with it, but the daughter is upset about privacy and territorial reasons. The author feels that the daughter's resistance is irrational and even compares it to a surgeon treating both family members.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical and professional boundaries here. The therapist's role is to maintain confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest. The therapist said it's okay, so that's a point in the author's favor. However, the daughter's concern about privacy is valid. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter might feel her privacy is invaded, especially if they're in a family setting where they interact. The therapist might not be able to remain entirely neutral if there's a family dynamic involved, especially if there are underlying issues between the parent and child.\n\nThe author is pushing back against the daughter's resistance, calling it irrational or territorial. But teenagers often have strong feelings about privacy, and it's part of developing autonomy. The author's intention to use this as a way to introduce family therapy is good, but the daughter's refusal to have therapy sessions with the parent present shows existing tensions. The therapist's approval is important, but maybe the author should consider the daughter's feelings more, even if they disagree.\n\nThe military background and the daughter's troubled history might add complexity. The author has their own trauma from tours, so seeking therapy is reasonable. However, the key issue is whether having the same therapist is appropriate. While the therapist isn't opposed, the potential for boundary issues exists if the therapist is treating both family members involved in conflicts. There's a risk that the therapist might not be able to remain impartial in sessions or that the daughter's trust could be compromised if she feels her private discussions might influence the parent's understanding of her.\n\nIn professional guidelines, therapists are generally advised against treating family members who have a relationship with each other to avoid conflicts of interest. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the author might be overstepping by not fully considering the daughter's perspective. The daughter's anger could be a valid expression of discomfort with the boundaries of her therapy. The author's comparison to a surgeon is flawed because the relationship between a therapist and patient is different from a surgeon; confidentiality and emotional dynamics are more complex in therapy.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be good, the situation could create more problems. The therapist's agreement isn't the only factor here. The daughter's right to privacy and the potential for complex family dynamics in therapy sessions are significant. The author might be in the wrong by not fully respecting the daughter's concerns and pushing back against her valid feelings about privacy and autonomy.\n"
