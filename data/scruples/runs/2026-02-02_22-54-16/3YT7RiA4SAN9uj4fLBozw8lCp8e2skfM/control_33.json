I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. \n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author introduced her to Karla through a group session. Now Karla works independently and the author wants to see her too. Karla says it's okay, but Ashley is upset, thinking it's a privacy breach. The author argues that Karla is the only therapist they trust and that it's similar to seeing the same surgeon. The wife and daughter think the author is wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: 1. Therapist says it's okay. 2. Daughter is upset about privacy. 3. Author wants to use the same trusted professional. \n\nI need to consider the ethical standards for therapists. Typically, having both a parent and child as clients can be tricky. Therapists usually avoid dual relationships to prevent conflicts of interest. Even if Karla is okay with it, there might be professional guidelines against it. For example, the American Psychological Association (APA) has ethics codes that caution against dual relationships because they can impair objectivity and affect the therapeutic relationship.\n\nAlso, from the daughter's perspective, sharing a therapist with a parent might make her feel her privacy is invaded. Teenagers might feel pressured or that their sessions aren't confidential. Even if the parent is aware of the confidentiality rules, the daughter's discomfort is significant. The author is dismissing her concerns as irrational or territorial, but that could be invalidating her feelings.\n\nHowever, the author is trying to seek help and might not have another trusted therapist. They argue that Karla is inclusive and supportive, which could help with family therapy. But the daughter resists any family sessions, so adding the parent might complicate things further.\n\nThe therapist's professional opinion is supportive, but maybe Karla isn't considering the potential issues from the daughter's side. The author might not realize that even if the therapist agrees, the situation could create tension in the family and undermine the daughter's trust in therapy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are good, the situation could be ethically problematic and harmful to the daughter. The author might be in the wrong by not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns and potentially violating therapy ethics.\n"
