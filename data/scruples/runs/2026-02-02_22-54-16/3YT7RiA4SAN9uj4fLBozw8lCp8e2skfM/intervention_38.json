I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter is upset about it, but the therapist says it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a parent, and the daughter feels her privacy is being invaded. The therapist, Karla, thinks it's okay, which is a point in the author's favor. But the daughter is a teenager and might feel territorial or concerned about confidentiality. Even though the author mentions patient confidentiality, the daughter still feels uncomfortable. \n\nThe parent wants to use the same therapist as a way to potentially start family therapy, which is a good intention. However, the daughter is resistant to family therapy. The parent might be trying to bridge communication, but the daughter's feelings need to be respected. \n\nIn terms of ethics, therapists usually don't see family members to avoid conflicts of interest. But in this case, the therapist already agreed, so maybe she's aware and it's acceptable. Still, the daughter's discomfort is valid. The parent should consider the daughter's perspective and whether this arrangement might strain their relationship. \n\nThe parent's argument about a surgeon is a bit of a comparison, but therapy has different boundaries than surgery. The parent is pushing back against the daughter's anger, which might come off as dismissive. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Well, they're trying to maintain a relationship with the therapist they trust, but they should also respect the daughter's privacy concerns. The therapist's okay with it, but the parent should ensure the daughter's comfort is prioritized. Maybe there's a middle ground, like family therapy sessions without the daughter feeling her private sessions are compromised. \n\nOverall, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they need to handle the situation more sensitively. The answer would be B, not in the wrong, but with some caveats about respecting the daughter's feelings.\n"
