I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The daughter is upset about it, feeling it's a privacy breach. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. Teenagers often value their privacy, especially in therapy. Even if the author already knows a lot, the daughter might feel uncomfortable if the therapist knows more intimate details. The author mentions patient confidentiality, which is important, but maybe the daughter still feels her privacy is invaded. That's a valid concern.\n\nThen there's the professional aspect. The therapist is okay with seeing both, but is that ethical? I'm not sure about the rules for therapists here. Some might say it's a conflict of interest if they're treating family members, but the therapist seems to have considered it and is okay with it. The author also wants to use this as a step towards family therapy, which the daughter refuses. The daughter's resistance to family therapy might be another point; if she's troubled, this could complicate things.\n\nThe author argues it's like being operated on by the same surgeon, implying it's about trust. But family dynamics can be tricky. If the daughter is already in therapy for her issues, adding the parent into the mix might not be helpful. The daughter's anger could be a sign that she's not ready for that, and the author might be pushing too hard, not respecting her boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to get support from a trusted therapist and wants to involve the family in therapy. The therapist's approval is a point in their favor. However, the daughter's feelings and privacy are significant. The author might be dismissing her valid concerns as irrational, which isn't good. Respecting boundaries is crucial, even if the parent doesn't see the issue.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset. The author is prioritizing their own needs and possibly trying to force family therapy. The daughter's privacy is a key ethical concern here. Even if the therapist is okay, the daughter's consent and comfort matter. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong ethically, but they might be inconsiderate of the daughter's feelings. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the therapist is okay, and the author isn't violating confidentiality, maybe they aren't wrong. But the daughter's perspective is important too. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, but the analysis is complex.\n"
