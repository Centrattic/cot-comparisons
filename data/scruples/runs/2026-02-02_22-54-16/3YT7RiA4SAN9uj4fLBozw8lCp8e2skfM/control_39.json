I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent, let's call them the author, has a daughter named Ashley who's been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author introduced Ashley to Karla through a military base hospital. Now Karla works independently, and the author wants to start seeing her too. However, Ashley is upset about this, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The author argues that Karla approved it and that there's no conflict of interest. The author also mentions that Ashley refuses family therapy and is acting out, so they think this is a way to start family sessions.\n\nI need to consider ethical guidelines for therapists. Therapists usually avoid dual relationships to prevent conflicts of interest. But in this case, the therapist already worked with the author before seeing Ashley. The author is an adult, so the therapist might have a professional relationship with them as well. However, the main issue is Ashley's discomfort. Teenagers, especially those in therapy, often feel that their privacy is invaded if a parent also sees the same therapist. This can affect their openness during sessions.\n\nThe therapist, Karla, says there's no conflict. But the therapist's approval doesn't necessarily override the patient's feelings. Ashley's privacy is protected by confidentiality, which the author acknowledges. However, the parent might not realize how this shared therapist could impact Ashley's trust. Even if the parent knows a lot already, the perception of shared information with a parent can make a teen feel exposed.\n\nThe author is using the analogy of a surgeon treating the whole family, but that's a different profession. In therapy, the dynamics are more about building trust and confidentiality. If Ashley feels her privacy is compromised, it could hinder her progress. The author wants family therapy but Ashley refuses, so this approach might not be effective. The author might be dismissing Ashley's valid concerns as just teenage anger, which could be a mistake.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the therapist might be in a dual relationship, which can be tricky. However, the therapist's approval is part of the scenario. But the parent's decision to proceed despite the daughter's objections could be seen as not respecting the daughter's autonomy and privacy needs. The parent might be in the right in their intention to get help, but the method might be wrong if it's causing the daughter distress without a clear therapeutic benefit.\n\nSo, balancing the parent's right to choose a therapist with the daughter's privacy and therapeutic needs is key. The answer likely hinges on whether the parent is respecting the daughter's boundaries. Since the daughter is in therapy and has valid concerns about privacy, the parent might be in the wrong by not fully considering the daughter's perspective and the potential negative impact on her therapy.\n"
