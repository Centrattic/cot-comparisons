I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let me break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the daughter already sees the therapist, Karla. The parent approached the therapist, who agreed there's no conflict, and the parent wants to start sessions too. The daughter is upset, feeling it's an invasion of privacy. The parent argues it's no different than a surgeon treating both, and wants to use it as a way to start family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with family present.\n\nThe parent is trying to balance respecting the daughter's feelings while not giving in to what they see as irrational behavior. The key points here are: therapist's approval, the daughter's privacy concerns, and the parent's intent to engage in family therapy.\n\nTherapists have ethical guidelines. Sharing the same therapist might require careful handling to maintain confidentiality for both. The daughter might feel her private sessions are being compromised, even if the parent knows some details already. The parent's approach could be seen as dismissive of the daughter's feelings if they push through without addressing her valid concerns. However, the therapist's sign-off might mitigate some of the conflict.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? It's a mix of intentions. They want to seek help and possibly improve family dynamics. But if the daughter feels her privacy is violated, even if the parent's intentions are good, it's a breach from her perspective. The therapist's role here is crucial\u2014if Karla is managing the sessions properly to maintain boundaries, then maybe it's okay. However, the daughter's discomfort is real and significant. The parent might not be in the wrong per se, but they should consider the daughter's feelings more and maybe find another therapist to avoid conflict. The answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong because they're acting in good faith and with the therapist's approval, but there's a nuance here. The daughter's right to privacy is important, and if the parent persists without addressing her concerns, it could be problematic. But since the therapist is on board, it's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer is B (No), but with a caveat that the parent should handle it sensitively.\n"
