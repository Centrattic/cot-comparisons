I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the father is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as his daughter, Ashley. The therapist, Karla, said it's okay, but Ashley is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The daughter started therapy a year ago, and the father, who's a military parent, recommended her to Karla. Now Karla works independently, and the father wants to see her too. The daughter is against it, citing privacy concerns. The father sees it as similar to having the same surgeon, which he argues is a valid comparison. The wife and daughter think he's wrong, but the therapist says it's fine.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the therapist is okay with it, but the daughter is upset. The father is trying to manage his own mental health and maybe see family therapy, but the daughter is resistant. The question is whether the father is in the wrong.\n\nI should think about boundaries and confidentiality. Even though the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's privacy is a big deal. If the father starts seeing the same therapist, there might be issues about how much the therapist shares between them. Also, the daughter being a teenager might feel that her privacy is being invaded. The father might not intend to violate confidentiality, but the daughter's discomfort could be valid. \n\nThe therapist's approval is important, but professional guidelines might have their own rules about seeing multiple family members. Maybe there's a conflict of interest the therapist didn't consider? Or maybe Karla is following the guidelines. \n\nThe father's argument about a surgeon is a bit different because surgeons don't handle the same kind of personal, confidential information that therapists do. So the analogy might not hold. Family therapy is one thing, but having the same individual therapist might complicate things. \n\nThe daughter has been through a lot, so her resistance might be due to past experiences or fear of her private issues being shared. The father might be overlooking her emotional needs by pushing despite her objections. Even if he's trying to be involved, respecting her boundaries is important. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the therapist approves, the father's decision might be disregarding his daughter's feelings and privacy. The daughter's right to privacy is a significant factor here. The father might not be in the wrong in a legal or professional sense, but ethically, he might be overstepping by not respecting her privacy concerns. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his daughter's privacy concerns even though the therapist says it's okay. But wait, the therapist did say it's fine, so maybe there's a professional boundary there. But the daughter's emotional well-being is also key. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the therapist approves and there's no professional issue, but the daughter's feelings are still valid. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. The AITA aspect is about public opinion, but the actual right or wrong here is more nuanced. \n\nIn the end, the father is acting on his own mental health needs and the therapist's approval, but the daughter's privacy is a major concern. Since the daughter is an adult (assuming she's 18+), but if she's a minor, then the parent has more authority. Wait, the scenario says \"typical teenaged girl,\" so she's likely a minor. In that case, the parent might have the right to access some information, but the therapist might need to maintain confidentiality with the daughter. There could be a conflict here. \n\nIf the daughter is a minor, the parent's involvement is more expected, but the therapist should still protect the daughter's confidentiality. However, if the daughter is a minor, the parent might legally be able to see the same therapist, but the therapist has to manage both their needs without breaching confidentiality between parent and child. That could be tricky. \n\nGiven that the therapist says it's okay, maybe it's acceptable, but the daughter's feelings are valid. The father might not be in the wrong legally or professionally, but ethically, he might be pushing against the daughter's comfort. However, since the therapist is okay with it, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the therapist approved and there's no clear professional violation, but the daughter's feelings are still important. The user is asking if he's in the wrong, and based on the info given, the answer is B.\n"
