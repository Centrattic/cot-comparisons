I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The key points here are the daughter's discomfort with privacy, the therapist's agreement, and the parents' perspective.\n\nFirst, the daughter is upset about privacy. Even though the parent mentions patient confidentiality, the daughter feels it's a breach. Teenagers often value their privacy highly, especially when dealing with sensitive issues. The parent might not realize how important that boundary is to the daughter. Even if the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's emotional response shouldn't be dismissed as just anger or territoriality. She has valid reasons related to trust and personal space.\n\nThe therapist, Karla, is okay with it and even thinks it's fine. However, therapists have a duty to maintain boundaries. If the daughter is uncomfortable, the therapist should probably address that concern first and ensure it's not just the parent's decision. The fact that the daughter refuses family therapy might indicate she's not ready for that dynamic, and forcing it could harm the therapeutic relationship.\n\nThe parent's analogy to a surgeon is a bit simplistic. Surgeons operate on multiple patients, but therapists deal with emotional and psychological issues where confidentiality and trust are paramount. The daughter's privacy is crucial here. The parent's insistence might come off as dismissive of her feelings, which could worsen her resistance to therapy.\n\nThe wife's opinion isn't detailed, but the parent is pushing despite the daughter's protests. The parent wants to use this as a way into family therapy, but the daughter isn't on board. This approach could backfire if the daughter feels her autonomy is being violated. The parent should consider alternative ways to encourage family therapy without infringing on her privacy.\n\nIn summary, while the parent's intentions might be good, forcing the same therapist could undermine the daughter's trust and therapy effectiveness. The author is likely overstepping by not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns, even if the therapist approves. So the answer would be AITA A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
