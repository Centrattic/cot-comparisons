I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The parent, who we'll call the author, introduced her to the therapist through a military connection. Now that Karla is independent, the author wants to start seeing her too. The daughter is upset, feeling it's a privacy breach, but the therapist says it's okay. The wife and daughter think the author is at fault (TA), but the author feels they're not.\n\nI need to consider ethical and practical aspects. Therapists usually have guidelines about treating multiple family members. Some might argue that it could create conflicts of interest or privacy issues. However, the therapist in this case says it's fine, which is a key point. Professional judgment matters here.\n\nThe daughter's perspective is important. She's a teenager with her own therapy experiences, and she might feel her privacy is invaded. Even though the author knows a lot about her daughter's issues, there's the legal aspect of patient confidentiality. The author's insistence on challenging the daughter for a reason might come off as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes comparing it to a surgeon, which might not be the best analogy. Family therapy could be beneficial, but forcing the daughter into a situation she's uncomfortable with might not be the right approach. The therapist's approval is a point in the author's favor, but the daughter's discomfort is also valid.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the therapist has assessed and approved, maybe they're not at fault. But respecting the daughter's autonomy and privacy is crucial. The answer might hinge on whether the therapist is ethically and professionally okay with it, which they are. But the daughter's feelings shouldn't be ignored. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the therapist agrees and the author isn't violating confidentiality, maybe they're not wrong. But the daughter's right to privacy is a strong counterpoint. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the therapist approves and the author isn't breaching confidentiality, but the daughter's feelings are still important. However, the parent's intent is to seek help, which is valid. So, B.\n"
