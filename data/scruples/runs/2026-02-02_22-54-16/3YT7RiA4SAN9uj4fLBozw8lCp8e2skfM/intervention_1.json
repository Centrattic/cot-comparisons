I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a parent (Ashley's parent) who introduced their daughter to Karla, the therapist, a year ago. Now the parent wants to start seeing Karla too, but the daughter is upset about it. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is resistant, citing privacy concerns. The parent thinks the daughter is being territorial or irrational.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and professional aspects. Therapists typically have guidelines about treating family members. Even if Karla says it's fine, there might be ethical considerations. For example, the therapist could have a conflict of interest if they need to treat both the parent and the child, especially if there are family dynamics at play. The daughter might feel her privacy is invaded, even if the therapist maintains confidentiality. \n\nThe parent's argument is that the therapist is the only one they trust and that it's similar to a family having the same surgeon. But therapy is different from surgery. The therapeutic relationship requires a level of trust and confidentiality. If the parent and daughter are in therapy with the same person, it could complicate sessions. The daughter might not feel comfortable discussing certain issues if she knows her parent could potentially be in the same therapist's care.\n\nThe therapist's role here is crucial. If Karla has agreed, maybe she's assessed the situation and believes it's manageable. But the daughter's feelings should not be dismissed as mere anger or irrationality. Teenagers often have strong feelings about privacy, and it's part of their development. The parent wants to use this as an introduction to family therapy, but the daughter refuses sessions with family present. That refusal might indicate that she's not ready for that level of involvement, so forcing the same therapist might not be the best approach.\n\nAlso, the parent might be projecting their own experiences with trauma onto the daughter, thinking that their shared therapist would help. However, each individual's therapeutic needs are unique. The parent's tours and experiences are personal, but the daughter's issues might be different. The therapist's ability to remain impartial could be compromised if they have to address issues involving both family members.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the American Psychological Association and other therapeutic bodies often advise against treating close family members because of potential conflicts. Even if Karla isn't part of the same family, the parent and daughter are, so the therapist could be in a tricky position. The daughter's privacy is a valid concern, and the parent's argument about patient confidentiality might not fully address her feelings of being exposed.\n\nSo, even though the therapist says it's okay, the parent might not be considering the daughter's emotional and psychological needs properly. The daughter's resistance is a red flag that needs to be addressed with sensitivity rather than dismissed. The parent's approach could be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter's therapy is supposed to be a safe space for her. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong by not respecting the daughter's boundaries and privacy, even with the therapist's approval.\n"
