I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but Ashley is upset about it, feeling it's a breach of her privacy. The parents want to do family therapy since Ashley refuses sessions with them present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical boundaries in therapy. Therapists are supposed to maintain confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest. Karla says it's fine, but maybe she's not considering the potential issues from Ashley's perspective. If the therapist is okay with it, maybe she thinks it's manageable. However, the daughter's main concern is privacy. Even if the parents know a lot, there are confidential aspects that the daughter might not want to share, knowing her parent is also a client.\n\nAlso, family therapy could be a different dynamic. If the daughter is resistant, forcing her to engage with the same therapist as her parent might create more tension. The parents might be trying to bridge the gap, but the daughter's reaction suggests she needs her own space in therapy. \n\nThe parents argue that it's similar to a surgeon operating on multiple family members, but therapy is different because of the emotional and confidential nature. The daughter's privacy is a significant factor here. Even if the therapist approves, the daughter's consent is important. The parents might be dismissing her legitimate concerns as just teenage anger, but her feelings are valid. \n\nIn ethical guidelines for therapists, having a therapist for multiple family members can be tricky. The therapist must ensure that each client's confidentiality is maintained and that their relationship doesn't interfere with their professional judgment. If Karla is handling both, she needs to be very clear about boundaries. \n\nThe parents want family therapy, but Ashley refuses to have them present. If the parents start seeing the same therapist, it could be a step towards family sessions, but without Ashley's agreement, it might not be helpful. The parents might be ignoring the daughter's autonomy in choosing her own therapeutic relationship. \n\nSo, the author is not necessarily in the wrong if the therapist consents and it's done ethically. But the daughter's feelings are valid, and the parents might need to address her concerns more sensitively. However, since the therapist is okay with it and the parents are trying to involve themselves in a supportive way, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the daughter's privacy is adequately protected and if the therapist is managing the situation properly. But given that the therapist approves and the parents are acting in good faith, the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But there are valid concerns about the daughter's privacy, so maybe A. Hmm.\n"
