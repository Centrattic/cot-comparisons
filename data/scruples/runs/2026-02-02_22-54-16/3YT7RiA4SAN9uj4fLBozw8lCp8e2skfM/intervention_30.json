I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The parent initially connected her to Karla through group sessions and now Karla works independently. The parent wants to see Karla too, and Karla is okay with it. The daughter is against it, citing privacy concerns. The parent argues that Karla's approval and the comparison to a surgeon are valid points. They also mention that family therapy might help since Ashley refuses sessions with family present. The wife and daughter think the parent is at fault, but the parent doesn't.\n\nHmm, from a professional standpoint, therapists usually recommend against it when a family member of a client wants to see the same therapist. It can complicate the therapeutic relationship for both parties. Even if Karla says it's okay, there might be underlying issues. The daughter's privacy is a valid concern. The parent might be overstepping by not respecting Ashley's boundaries, even if they don't know all the details. The parent mentions challenging Ashley to give a reason, but that could be dismissive of her feelings. The parent's argument about the surgeon is a bit of a stretch because a surgeon's role is different from a therapist's, especially regarding confidentiality. Also, the parent's desire for family therapy is good, but doing it through the same therapist might not be the best approach. It's possible the parent is projecting their own needs onto Ashley. So, even though Karla is on board, the ethical guidelines in therapy usually advise against it. The answer might be A, the parent is at fault.\n"
