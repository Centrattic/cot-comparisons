I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a father (the author) whose daughter, Ashley, has a therapist named Karla. The father wants to start seeing Karla too, but Ashley is upset about it. The therapist has said it's okay, but the daughter is concerned about privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Therapists are bound by confidentiality, so if Karla agreed to see both, she probably has a way to manage that. But the daughter's feelings are important. Teenagers often value privacy, and having a parent involved might make her feel her privacy is invaded, even if the therapist handles it professionally.\n\nThe father mentioned that the daughter refuses family therapy and that he wants to use this as a way to introduce it. That's a bit of a stretch. Seeing the same therapist isn't the same as family therapy, which typically involves sessions together. The daughter might see this as a step toward something she doesn't want, hence her anger.\n\nAlso, the father is trying to push back against what he calls \"irrational or territorial behavior.\" But from Ashley's perspective, it's about trust and boundaries. The father might not realize that even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's discomfort is valid. The mother and daughter think the father is wrong (TA), while the therapist agrees it's fine. So there's a conflict between the family's opinion and the therapist's.\n\nI should check if there are any ethical guidelines. Typically, a therapist can see multiple family members but needs to manage boundaries to avoid conflicts. The therapist might have safeguards in place, like separate sessions and confidentiality, but the daughter's reaction suggests that it's not just about the therapist's policies but her personal feelings.\n\nThe father's argument about a surgeon is a bit of a stretch. A surgeon treating a parent and child is different because it's a medical professional relationship, not a therapeutic one where confidentiality is a bigger issue. The father might not be considering that Ashley's trust in her therapist is being tested here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the father's intentions might be good, but the way he's approaching it could be dismissive of his daughter's feelings. The key is respecting her privacy and autonomy, even if the therapist thinks it's okay. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not fully respecting his daughter's concerns about privacy and boundaries, even if the therapist approves.\n"
