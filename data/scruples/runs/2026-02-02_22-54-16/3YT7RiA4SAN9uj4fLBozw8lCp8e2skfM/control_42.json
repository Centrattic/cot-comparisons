I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the parent) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The parent's daughter, Ashley, has been seeing a therapist named Karla for a year. The parent met Karla through their military base hospital and recommended her to Ashley. Now that Karla works independently, the parent wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about it, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that they already know a lot about each other's issues, except what's confidential, and they want to do family therapy since Ashley refuses it otherwise. The wife and daughter think the parent is the problem here.\n\nSo, the key points are: the therapist is okay with it, the daughter is uncomfortable, and the parent is trying to balance respecting her feelings while not giving in to what they see as irrational behavior. \n\nI need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Typically, a therapist treating both a parent and child might have some ethical considerations. Even if the therapist says it's okay, there could be potential conflicts of interest. For example, the therapist might have to manage dual relationships, which can be tricky. However, if the therapist has assessed the situation and feels it's appropriate, maybe it's okay. But the main issue here is the daughter's discomfort. \n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, even if the parent knows a lot, the daughter might feel that sharing personal issues with a therapist is a private space. The parent might be overstepping by assuming that since the therapist allows it, it's fine, but the daughter's feelings are valid. The parent might not be considering the daughter's emotional boundaries and could be pushing for family therapy in a way that doesn't respect Ashley's current readiness. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the daughter is \"troubled\" and a typical teen. This suggests that the daughter's resistance might be valid, not just rebellious. The parent's analogy about the same surgeon doesn't quite hold because therapy is different from surgery in terms of privacy and emotional dynamics. \n\nThe parent is trying to facilitate family therapy, which is good, but the approach might be forcing the issue. The answer might hinge on whether respecting the daughter's privacy is more important than the parent's desire to be involved. The parent might not be in the wrong if the therapist approves, but the daughter's feelings are still significant. However, if the parent is dismissing the daughter's valid concerns as \"irrational\" or \"territorial,\" then they might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the parent's intention is good, but the execution might be flawed. They're not considering the daughter's perspective adequately. So maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they're not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns, even if the therapist says it's okay. Alternatively, if the therapist is okay and the parent is acting in good faith, maybe B. But since the daughter's privacy is a key aspect here, the parent might be overstepping.\n"
