I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter (Ashley) has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent (the author) met Karla through the military hospital and thought she was a good fit for Ashley. Now that Karla is independent, the parent wants to see her too, but the daughter is upset about it. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter feels it's a breach of her privacy. The author is trying to balance respecting Ashley's feelings with not giving in to what they see as irrational behavior. They also mention that the daughter refuses family therapy sessions with the parent and wife present, so this might be a way to start that process.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parent is seeking therapy from the same professional, the therapist is okay with it, the daughter is against it, and the parent is trying to justify it. The author believes they're not in the wrong (TA) and the user wants to confirm if that's accurate.\n\nI need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Typically, therapists avoid multiple relationships with clients to prevent conflicts of interest. However, in some cases, if both clients consent and the therapist deems it appropriate, it might be acceptable. The therapist (Karla) here has already given her consent, which is a positive sign. But the main issue is the daughter's discomfort. The parent is pushing back, arguing that it's no different than a surgeon treating multiple family members, which is a common analogy. However, the parent might not be considering the daughter's perspective fully. \n\nThe daughter's anger could stem from privacy concerns. Even if the parent says they already know a lot, the daughter might feel her private information is being shared indirectly. The parent is challenging the daughter to give a reason not to proceed, which might come off as dismissive. The parent also wants to use this as a step into family therapy, which the daughter is resistant to. \n\nThe parent is trying to balance respect for their daughter's feelings with their own judgment. But if the daughter is in therapy to process personal issues, having the parent involved in the same therapist's practice could complicate that. The therapist's role here is crucial; they need to maintain boundaries and ensure that both the parent and daughter feel comfortable. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's comfort is equally vital. The parent might be in the right if the therapist is managing the situation appropriately and there's no breach of confidentiality. However, the parent's dismissal of the daughter's feelings as \"irrational or territorial\" could be problematic. It's possible the daughter's feelings are valid and rooted in trust issues or fear of exposure. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parent might not be entirely wrong, but there's a need for sensitivity towards the daughter's perspective. The key is whether the therapist is managing the situation ethically and if the parent's actions are respectful of the daughter's privacy and emotional needs. If the therapist is handling it well and the parent is making an effort to understand, then maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. But if the parent is being dismissive of the daughter's valid concerns, that could tip the scale. \n\nIn this case, the author argues they're not in the wrong, and the therapist supports the arrangement. The answer leans towards B (No), but with a note about considering the daughter's feelings more carefully. The parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they approach the situation.\n"
