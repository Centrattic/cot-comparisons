I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is against it, citing privacy concerns. The therapist says it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider therapist boundaries. Typically, having multiple clients in the same family can lead to conflicts. For example, the therapist might have to navigate confidentiality issues between parent and child. The daughter feels her privacy is invaded, which is a valid concern. Even if the parent is told some info, the child's right to confidentiality is crucial in therapy. \n\nThe parent argues that the therapist is okay with it, but the therapist's approval doesn't necessarily negate the potential for conflict. The parent might be overlooking how this could affect the daughter's trust in therapy. If the daughter feels her privacy isn't respected, she might withdraw or not be honest in sessions. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions the daughter is \"troubled,\" so this situation could be stressful for her. The parent's approach to using the same therapist might come off as dismissive of her feelings, treating her anger as irrational. While the parent wants family therapy, the daughter's refusal to have sessions with the parent and spouse present is a red flag. Forcing the therapist to work with both might not be effective if the daughter isn't cooperative.\n\nThe therapist's role is to maintain a safe space for each client. If the daughter feels uncomfortable, the therapist might inadvertently take sides or the parent might share information the daughter didn't intend to share. This could undermine the therapeutic process. \n\nIn professional ethics, therapists usually avoid dual relationships that could impair their judgment. Even if the therapist says it's fine, there's a risk of boundary issues. The parent's reasoning about a skilled surgeon analogy doesn't apply here because therapy involves more personal and confidential information than a surgeon-patient relationship. \n\nSo, while the parent's intention is to seek help, the daughter's privacy and comfort are essential. The parent might be in the wrong because they're not fully respecting the daughter's boundaries and the confidentiality that's necessary for effective therapy.\n"
