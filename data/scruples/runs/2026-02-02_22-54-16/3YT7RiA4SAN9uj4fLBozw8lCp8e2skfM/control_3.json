I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical guidelines for therapists. In many places, therapists are trained to avoid dual relationships that could impair their professional judgment. The American Psychological Association (APA) has guidelines about multiple relationships, which generally advise against them unless they're in the client's best interest and the risks are managed. If the therapist is comfortable and believes it's okay, that's a point in the parent's favor.\n\nThen there's the daughter's perspective. She feels it's a breach of privacy. Even though the parent knows a lot already, the daughter's right to confidentiality is important. The parent's pushback about not giving a valid reason might be because the daughter is struggling with emotional issues, making her resistant. The parent's comparison to a surgeon isn't quite the same, since surgeons don't share the same kind of confidential information as therapists.\n\nThe daughter's refusal to do family therapy is a red flag. It suggests she might not be ready for that dynamic, which could complicate things. The parent's intent is to seek help, but the daughter's feelings need to be respected. However, the parent isn't overriding the daughter's choice yet; they're making a personal decision about their own healthcare.\n\nThe therapist's approval is key here. If Karla, the therapist, has assessed the situation and deemed it acceptable, that's a professional judgment call. Still, there's a potential conflict if the daughter's confidentiality could be inadvertently compromised, even if not intentionally. The parent should be cautious to ensure the daughter's privacy isn't breached.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're seeking therapy from a trusted professional who's approved. However, they should communicate with their daughter to address her concerns and ensure that the daughter's confidentiality is maintained. The parent's actions don't seem malicious, but they need to be mindful of the daughter's feelings and the ethical boundaries. So, the answer would be B, the parent isn't in the wrong, but they should handle it carefully.\n"
