I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The author approached Karla about also being her therapist, and Karla agreed. But Ashley is upset about it, thinking it's a privacy issue. The author is trying to balance respecting Ashley's feelings but also not giving in to what they see as irrational behavior. The wife and daughter think the author is in the wrong, but the therapist says it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Therapists usually have strict rules about confidentiality and dual relationships. If Karla is a professional, she should have considered these boundaries before agreeing to see both the parent and the daughter. But the author says Karla thought it was fine. Maybe Karla assessed that there's no conflict of interest, but that's something to verify.\n\nFrom Ashley's perspective, she might feel her privacy is invaded. Therapy is a confidential space, and having a parent also see the same therapist could make her feel like her private issues are being discussed. The author mentions that they already know a lot about Ashley's situation, but confidentiality is still a key part of therapy. Even if the author isn't getting detailed info, the perception of breach could be damaging to Ashley's trust in therapy.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's no different from a surgeon operating on both of them, but therapy isn't medical treatment in the same way. The therapeutic relationship relies on trust and the client feeling safe. If the daughter feels unsafe or pressured, that could hinder her progress. The author also wants to introduce family therapy, but the daughter is resistant. Family therapy typically involves all parties agreeing to participate, so forcing it might not be effective.\n\nThe therapist's role is to maintain professional boundaries. If the therapist is seeing both parent and child, there's a risk of blurred boundaries. The therapist might be in a position where they have to take sides, or the parent might influence the therapist's approach with the child. This could create a conflict of interest even if the therapist initially thinks it's okay.\n\nThe author's intention is to seek help and possibly involve family therapy, but the method might be problematic. The daughter's resistance needs to be taken seriously. Parental authority doesn't override a teenager's right to privacy, especially in sensitive areas like mental health. The author might be dismissing the daughter's valid concerns as \"territorial\" or irrational, which isn't helpful. Respecting the daughter's autonomy is important, even if the parent feels they know best.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, the action of seeing the same therapist as their daughter, despite the daughter's objections, could be ethically questionable. The therapist's agreement doesn't necessarily override the daughter's right to privacy and consent. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
