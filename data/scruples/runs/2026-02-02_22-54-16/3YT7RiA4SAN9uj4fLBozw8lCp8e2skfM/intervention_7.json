I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as his daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The father met Karla through the military hospital, sent Ashley to her sessions, and now that Karla is independent, he wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about privacy. The parents think the father is in the right, but the daughter is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethics in therapy. Therapists have boundaries to avoid conflicts of interest. If Karla is okay with seeing both, maybe it's acceptable. But there's a potential for boundary issues if the therapist is treating family members. The daughter's privacy is important under HIPAA; the therapist can't share details without her consent. However, the father might be informed about general progress if the daughter allows it. The daughter's objection is about privacy, which is valid. The father might not be in the wrong if he's respecting confidentiality, but the daughter's feelings need to be considered. The father's reasoning about family therapy makes sense, but the daughter's refusal to have sessions with the parents suggests she's not ready. The therapist's approval is a point in favor, but the daughter's distress is a concern. Overall, the father might not be in the wrong, but there's a need to balance his needs with her autonomy and privacy.\n"
