I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter has been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The parent arranged for the daughter to see her initially. Now the therapist works independently and the parent wants to see her too. The daughter is upset about this, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that the therapist said it's okay, and they want family therapy since the daughter refuses to have sessions with them or the wife present.\n\nSo, the main points here. The daughter feels her privacy is being invaded. The parent is trying to get involved in the therapy process, which the therapist approves. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time of seeking independence, so this might be part of it. The parent wants to use this as a way to introduce family therapy, which the daughter isn't open to yet.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in therapy. Therapists have strict boundaries to maintain patient confidentiality and trust. If the parent starts seeing the same therapist, even if the therapist is okay with it, there could be issues. The daughter might feel that her private information is now shared with her parent, which could hinder her openness in sessions. The therapist might have a conflict of interest if she's treating both parent and child, possibly complicating the therapeutic relationship with the daughter.\n\nThe parent mentions that the therapist said it's fine, but the daughter is against it. The parent is dismissing the daughter's concerns as irrational or territorial, which is a red flag. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's feelings of privacy being breached should be taken seriously. The parent's analogy about the surgeon is a bit off; therapy is different from surgery in terms of privacy and emotional trust.\n\nThe daughter's refusal to do family therapy might stem from feeling that her personal issues are being brought into family discussions without her consent. The parent's approach might be seen as overstepping, not respecting the daughter's autonomy in her therapy. Even if the parent has good intentions, the daughter's emotional needs here are significant. \n\nAlso, the parent is framing their desire as wanting to help, but it could be perceived as a lack of trust in the daughter's process. The daughter's privacy is a key ethical aspect in therapy. By wanting to see the same therapist, the parent might be undermining that trust. The therapist's approval doesn't necessarily override the daughter's feelings about her privacy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent has valid reasons, the daughter's privacy and emotional boundaries are being compromised. The parent isn't in the wrong necessarily, but they might be mishandling the situation by not fully addressing the daughter's concerns. The answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but there's a need for better communication and respecting boundaries.\n"
