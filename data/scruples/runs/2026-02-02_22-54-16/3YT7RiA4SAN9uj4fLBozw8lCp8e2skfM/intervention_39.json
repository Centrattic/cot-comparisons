I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The scenario is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The parent (let's call them Parent) arranged for Ashley to start with Dr. Karla because they thought she was good. Now, Dr. Karla works independently and the Parent wants to be seen by her too. The daughter is upset about this, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The Parent argues that Dr. Karla said it's okay, and they want to use this as a way to do family therapy since Ashley refuses to have sessions with the Parent or their wife present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and professional standards for therapists. Therapists have strict confidentiality rules. Even if the therapist says it's okay, there might be professional guidelines against having both parent and child as clients. The American Psychological Association (APA) has ethics codes that might address this. For example, multiple relationships can be problematic. If the therapist is treating both the parent and child, it could create conflicts of interest, especially if the parent and child have issues with each other. The therapist might have difficulty maintaining impartiality, and the daughter's confidentiality could be compromised. Even if the therapist says it's okay, the dynamic could become complex.\n\nThen there's the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, which is a time when privacy and autonomy are important. The daughter feels her privacy is being invaded. The Parent argues that they already know a lot, but the issue is that some information is confidential. The daughter might feel that sharing with the therapist would inadvertently lead to her parent knowing things she doesn't want them to know. Even if the therapist is careful, the perception of breach could damage the therapeutic relationship for the daughter.\n\nThe Parent mentions the surgeon analogy, but therapy isn't the same as surgery. In surgery, the parent and child could both be operated on by the same surgeon, but therapy involves a different kind of relationship where confidentiality is key. The Parent's argument might not hold up because the therapeutic relationship is more about trust and privacy than a medical procedure.\n\nAlso, the daughter's resistance to family therapy is significant. If the Parent pushes for this, it might worsen their relationship. The Parent is trying to use the therapist to facilitate family therapy, but the daughter isn't on board. Forcing this could be counterproductive. The therapist might not be equipped to handle multiple family members, leading to potential ethical issues.\n\nThe therapist's approval is mentioned, but that doesn't necessarily override professional guidelines. The therapist might not realize the full implications or might be reluctant to say no because of the Parent's influence. There's a possibility that the therapist is not adhering to ethical standards by agreeing to take on both clients.\n\nIn terms of the Parent's intentions, they want to use this as a way to approach family therapy, but the daughter's resistance suggests it's not the right time or approach. The Parent's determination to proceed despite the daughter's feelings could be seen as dismissive of her autonomy and emotional needs.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the Parent might be in the wrong by not respecting the daughter's concerns about privacy and by potentially getting the therapist involved in a way that could lead to conflicts. The Parent should consider the daughter's feelings more and maybe seek alternative ways to address family therapy without involving the same therapist.\n"
