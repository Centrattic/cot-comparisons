I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect.

She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author, let's call them Parent, has a daughter named Ashley who started seeing a therapist, Karla, about a year ago. Parent met Karla through the on-base hospital when Karla was working there. Even though Karla wasn't their own therapist, Parent recommended Ashley to one of Karla's teen group counseling sessions. Ashley liked it and later transitioned to one-on-one sessions with Karla. Now, Karla works independently and has a nice office, and Parent feels she's the only therapist they trust. Karla said it's okay to see Parent as well. However, Ashley is upset about this, thinking it's a breach of her privacy. Parent acknowledges the privacy aspect but argues that they already know most things and that it's no different than a surgeon treating both. The wife and daughter think Parent is in the wrong, but the therapist says it's fine. Parent wants to know if they are in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical boundaries in therapy. Therapists are trained to avoid dual relationships where a single therapeutic relationship might be compromised. But in this case, the therapist, Karla, is okay with seeing both the Parent and Ashley. So from a professional standpoint, if Karla has done the proper evaluation and feels it's appropriate, maybe it's not a conflict. However, I should check if there are any guidelines against this.\n\nThe American Psychological Association (APA) Ethics Code has guidelines on multiple relationships. Specifically, Section 3.05 says that a therapist should avoid relationships that could impair professional judgment or increase the risk of harm to the client. If the therapist is managing the sessions carefully, maybe this isn't a problem. But sometimes, even if the therapist thinks it's okay, there could be underlying issues. The parent might be overstepping Ashley's boundaries, even if they have good intentions.\n\nAshley is a teenager, which is a time of developing autonomy and identity. Even if the parent and therapist see it as inclusive, Ashley's feelings about privacy are valid. The parent is trying to use therapy for family cohesion, but Ashley is resistant. The parent mentions that Ashley refuses family therapy with them and their wife present. If the parent wants to involve the therapist in the family dynamic, maybe that's a good approach, but using the same therapist might not be the right way. \n\nThe parent's argument about the surgeon is interesting, but therapy isn't the same as surgery. Privacy in therapy is more sensitive because the client is sharing deeply personal information. Even if the parent and daughter have a close relationship, the daughter's discomfort needs to be respected. The parent is pushing back against Ashley's anger, which could lead to more conflict. The wife also thinks the parent is in the wrong, so there might be family dynamics at play here.\n\nBut since the therapist has given her consent and doesn't see a conflict, that's a point in the parent's favor. However, the daughter's right to privacy is a significant concern. The parent might not realize how important confidentiality is to the daughter, especially if she's been through a lot. The daughter could feel that her private issues are being shared or that the therapist is biased towards the parent. \n\nIn family therapy, it's common for the therapist to work with all family members, but it's typically structured so that each member has individual sessions as well as family sessions. The parent wants to see the same therapist but not necessarily in the same sessions. However, if the therapist is handling both, there's a potential for boundary issues. For example, if the therapist shares information from the daughter's sessions with the parent, that's a breach of confidentiality. But the parent mentioned that they respect patient confidentiality, so maybe Karla is careful about that.\n\nThe key points here are: the therapist's agreement, the daughter's privacy concerns, and the parent's intention to facilitate family therapy. The parent is in a tough spot, wanting to support their daughter while respecting her boundaries. If the daughter's privacy is maintained and the therapist is managing the dual relationships appropriately, then maybe the parent is not in the wrong. But if the parent is using this as a way to overstep or control, that's a different issue.\n\nI should also consider the daughter's perspective. As a troubled teen, she might already feel vulnerable, and having her parent involved in the same therapist could make her reluctant to open up. The parent's approach might inadvertently undermine the therapeutic relationship by making the daughter feel pressured. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's emotional response is a red flag. \n\nIn conclusion, while the therapist's approval is a mitigating factor, the daughter's privacy and comfort are paramount. The parent's intentions might be good, but the action could be seen as crossing a boundary. The answer might be that the parent isn't in the wrong because the therapist agreed, but the daughter's feelings should still be respected. However, the parent might need to address the daughter's concerns more empathetically instead of dismissing them as just anger or territorial behavior.\n"
