I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter is uncomfortable with this, but the therapist, Karla, says it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, and she's already in therapy, which might mean she's going through something sensitive. She's worried about her privacy. Even if the parent knows a lot, patient confidentiality is a big thing, and she's right to be concerned. The parent is downplaying her feelings by comparing it to a surgeon example, but that might not address her actual emotional discomfort.\n\nThe parent wants to use the same therapist to possibly start family therapy since their daughter refuses to have sessions with them. The therapist is okay with it, but the daughter is against it. The parent is trying to respect the daughter's feelings but also not giving in to what they see as irrational behavior. \n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and consent in therapy. Therapists usually have strict rules about multiple family members in the same practice because it can complicate confidentiality and create conflicts. The daughter's privacy is important, and even if the parent is allowed to see the therapist, the daughter's consent isn't being considered here. The parent is pushing despite the daughter's objections, which could be seen as disregarding her autonomy. \n\nThe therapist might have given the green light, but the daughter's comfort is crucial. Therapy is a safe space, and if the daughter feels her privacy is compromised, that could harm her therapeutic relationship. The parent's argument about family therapy is valid, but forcing the same therapist might not be the right approach. They might need a different therapist for family sessions to maintain boundaries.\n\nSo, the parent is trying to do what they think is best, but the daughter's feelings and privacy are significant. The answer might be that the parent isn't in the wrong, but they need to respect the daughter's concerns more. However, given the daughter's strong objections, the parent should reconsider. But according to the options, if the answer is whether the author is in the wrong, maybe B (No) because the therapist approved, but ethically, the daughter's concerns should be addressed. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer leans towards B (No) because the therapist is okay with it, but the parent should still be cautious. However, the daughter's right to privacy is a major factor. Maybe the parent is not in the wrong, but they need to handle it more sensitively.\n"
