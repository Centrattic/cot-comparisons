I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a daughter (Ashley) who has been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The parent (the author) now wants to see Karla too, but Ashley is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Therapists usually have boundaries to maintain confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest. The parent mentioned that Karla agreed to see them, which suggests she's comfortable with it. But the daughter is against it, feeling it's a privacy breach. The parent argues that they already know a lot and that it's like seeing the same surgeon. The daughter is a teen, which complicates things because teenagers are in a stage where they value privacy and independence more.\n\nThe key points here are consent from the therapist, the daughter's feelings, and the potential impact on the therapeutic relationship. Even though the therapist approves, the daughter's emotional reaction is valid. The parent wants family therapy but the daughter refuses sessions with family present. The parent might be trying to bridge communication, but the daughter's resistance could mean this approach isn't the best.\n\nI should also consider professional guidelines. Therapists might avoid working with multiple family members to prevent complex dynamics. Karla might have considered that and agreed, but it's possible there are unspoken reasons. The parent's intention to use this as a step toward family therapy is understandable, but if the daughter doesn't agree, it might not be the right time.\n\nThe parent isn't in the wrong per se, but maybe they're not considering the daughter's emotional needs enough. They might be prioritizing their own desire for therapy over respecting her boundaries, even if the therapist is okay with it. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the parent isn't violating any rules and the therapist agrees, but there's room for nuance in considering the daughter's feelings.\n"
