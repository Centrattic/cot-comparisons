I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist their daughter is seeing. The daughter is upset about it, thinking it's a breach of privacy. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. Teenagers often value their privacy, especially when it comes to therapy. Therapy sessions are supposed to be confidential, and if the daughter fears that her private information might be shared with her parent, that could make her reluctant to open up. Even if the parent is already aware of a lot, the daughter might feel that the therapist is now taking sides or that her trust is compromised. The parent mentions that the daughter can't come up with a reason, but maybe it's about the feeling of intrusion rather than specific information.\n\nThen there's the aspect of professional boundaries. Therapists usually have strict guidelines about treating multiple members of the same family. If they see both the parent and child, it could complicate the therapeutic relationship. For example, the daughter might feel that the therapist isn't neutral if the parent is also a client. It could create conflicts, especially if the daughter discusses family issues. The therapist, Karla, might be overstepping if she's not careful about maintaining confidentiality between the parent and child.\n\nThe parent argues that Karla has agreed it's okay. But the therapist's approval doesn't necessarily mean it's the best decision for the daughter. The parent might be prioritizing their own need for therapy over the daughter's comfort, which could be seen as dismissive of the daughter's feelings. The parent also mentions the daughter is \"troubled,\" which suggests that her mental health is already a concern. Pressuring her by seeing the same therapist could exacerbate her issues, making her resist therapy even more.\n\nFamily therapy might be a better approach if the parent wants to involve the family in the process. That way, all parties can discuss their feelings in a structured environment. The parent's reasoning about a surgeon analogy is a bit flawed because therapy involves more personal and emotional aspects than surgery. Privacy and trust are crucial in therapy, and the parent might not fully grasp how their actions affect the daughter's trust in the therapeutic relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention isn't malicious, the action could be seen as disregarding the daughter's privacy and the potential professional boundaries. The daughter's feelings of privacy violation are valid, and the parent might be in the wrong by not adequately respecting that.\n"
