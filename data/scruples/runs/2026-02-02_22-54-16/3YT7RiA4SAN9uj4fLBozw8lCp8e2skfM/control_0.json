I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The scenario involves a military parent whose daughter has been seeing a therapist named Karla. The parent initially referred the daughter to Karla and now wants to see Karla as well, but the daughter is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects of a therapist treating multiple members of the same family. Generally, therapists are trained to manage such situations, but there are potential conflicts of interest. For example, confidentiality is a big concern. Even though the therapist might say it's okay, the daughter is concerned about her privacy. The parent mentions that the therapist is on board, but the daughter is resistant. \n\nThe daughter's feelings are valid here. Teens, especially those who've been through a lot, might feel their privacy is invaded. The parent is trying to justify it by comparing it to a surgeon example, but that's a different context. Therapy involves more personal and confidential information, so the comparison might not hold. \n\nThe parent also mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy sessions with the wife present. The parent's intention is to use the same therapist for family therapy, but the daughter's refusal suggests that this might not be the right approach. The therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's consent and comfort are equally crucial. \n\nFrom a professional ethics standpoint, the therapist should consider the potential for boundary issues. Even if the therapist thinks it's okay, the daughter's distress is a red flag. The parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns. The parent's desire for family therapy is understandable, but the approach here might be problematic because it's not the daughter's choice.\n\nSo, the parent might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action could be seen as disregarding the daughter's privacy and autonomy. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A) because the daughter's feelings and the potential ethical issues in therapy relationships are significant factors.\n"
