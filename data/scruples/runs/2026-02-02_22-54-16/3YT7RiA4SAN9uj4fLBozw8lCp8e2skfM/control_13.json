I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a daughter who's been seeing a therapist for a year, and now the parent wants to see the same therapist. The therapist is okay with it, but the daughter is upset about privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Therapists usually have boundaries. If the therapist says it's okay, that's a point in the parent's favor. But the daughter's concerns about privacy are valid. Therapists are trained to handle confidentiality, but sharing the same provider might compromise that. The daughter might feel pressured or that her privacy is being invaded, especially if she's a teenager dealing with her own issues.\n\nThe parent argues that it's similar to being operated on by the same surgeon, but that's a different context. Surgery is a medical procedure where multiple people can be involved, but therapy is more personal and confidential. The parent also wants to do family therapy, which the daughter refuses. The parent's intention is to involve the therapist more in the family, but the daughter's resistance suggests she might not be ready for that.\n\nThe therapist's role is crucial here. Even if the therapist agrees, there might be professional guidelines against dual relationships. Therapists are supposed to avoid situations where they have multiple roles with the same person, which could lead to conflicts of interest. However, in this case, it's two different clients (parent and child) with the same therapist. The therapist might have a policy allowing this, but it's a gray area.\n\nThe daughter's reaction could be a mix of privacy concerns and feeling that her parent isn't respecting her space. The parent might be overstepping by not fully considering the daughter's feelings. Even if the parent thinks they know a lot, the confidential aspect is important in therapy. The daughter might feel that discussing her issues with her parent present is necessary if the parent is the same therapist, leading to potential conflict.\n\nThe parent is trying to bridge the gap with family therapy, but the daughter's refusal indicates she isn't comfortable. The parent's approach might be seen as dismissive of the daughter's boundaries. Ethically, the parent should respect the daughter's privacy and autonomy, even if they think it's for the best. The therapist's approval isn't enough if it's causing distress to the patient.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions might be good, the key issue is the daughter's right to privacy and the potential ethical concerns in therapy. The parent might be in the wrong by pushing for this despite the daughter's objections.\n"
