I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, is already seeing Dr. Karla and is uncomfortable with her parent also being a patient there. The parent got the okay from the therapist, who said there's no conflict of interest, but the daughter is upset about privacy concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical guidelines for therapists. Most professional codes, like the American Psychological Association's, emphasize confidentiality and boundaries. If the therapist (Karla) thinks it's fine, maybe she's followed the necessary steps, like ensuring that the daughter's confidentiality isn't compromised. But the daughter is a teenager, so her ability to consent might be a factor. In some cases, minors' consent is managed by their guardians, but the therapist should still obtain the minor's assent if possible.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that they want family therapy, which the daughter is resisting. The daughter feels it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that the therapist approved it. However, even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's feelings are valid. Teenagers often feel their privacy is invaded when their parents are involved in their therapy. There's a risk of the daughter feeling pressured or that her trust is being breached, which could affect the therapeutic relationship.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions the daughter has been through a lot, which might make privacy even more crucial. If the daughter is resistant, pushing through could exacerbate her stress. The therapist might need to assess whether involving the parent could create any conflicts in the existing therapy sessions. It's possible that the therapist isn't considering the daughter's emotional response, which is a key part of ethical practice\u2014respecting the client's autonomy and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is to seek help for themselves, which is valid. But the daughter's current discomfort should be addressed. The parent might not be in the wrong for wanting therapy, but the approach here could be problematic. The therapist's approval is a point in favor, but the daughter's feelings and the potential for conflict need to be weighed. The parent should probably explore another therapist to avoid any potential issues, even if the current one is okay with it. Ethically, the priority should be the daughter's comfort and the integrity of her therapy sessions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong, but there are ethical concerns that need to be addressed. However, the daughter's perspective is valid, and the parent's insistence despite her objections could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The therapist's role here is crucial\u2014maybe they should mediate or ensure both parties are comfortable. But ultimately, if the daughter feels her privacy is at risk, the parent might need to step back to respect that, even if the therapist approves. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the right based on the therapist's approval, but the daughter's feelings are still important. However, the parent might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
