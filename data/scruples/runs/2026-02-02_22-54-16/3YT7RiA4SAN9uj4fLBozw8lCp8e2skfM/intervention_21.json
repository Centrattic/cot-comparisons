I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The scenario is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent, after meeting Karla through work, recommended her to Ashley, who then started seeing her. Now the parent wants to see the same therapist, but the daughter is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when they might be more sensitive about privacy. The parent mentioned that the therapist has agreed it's okay, which is a key point. Professional boundaries are important in therapy, so if the therapist says it's fine, that's a strong indicator that there's no conflict of interest on the professional side.\n\nThe parent argues that they want to respect the daughter's feelings but don't want to give in to what they perceive as irrational anger or territorial behavior. They also mention that the daughter refuses family therapy with them, so this could be a way to start that. However, the daughter feels her privacy is being breached. Even though the parent claims to know a lot already, the confidential aspect is a big part of therapy, and sharing the same therapist might make the daughter feel that her private matters are being discussed with someone close to the family.\n\nThe parent's reasoning includes comparing it to having the same surgeon, but therapy is different from medical surgery in terms of confidentiality and emotional boundaries. The daughter might feel that the therapist is now part of the family dynamic, which could complicate future therapy sessions if there's any tension between the family and the therapist.\n\nThe therapist's approval is there, which is crucial. But the parent's decision also needs to consider the daughter's emotional well-being. Even if the parent thinks they're acting in the best interest, overriding the daughter's consent could lead to further resistance or trust issues. The parent is trying to balance respecting the daughter's privacy with their own needs and the potential benefits of family therapy. However, forcing the issue might not be the right approach if the daughter is genuinely upset.\n\nThe parent's wife also sides with the daughter, which might indicate that the parent is being too rigid. The parent's argument that the daughter can't provide a valid reason might be because the daughter is struggling to articulate her feelings, which is common with teenagers. The parent might be dismissing valid concerns under the guise of rationality.\n\nIn conclusion, while the therapist's blessing is important, the daughter's feelings about privacy and consent should be taken seriously. The parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist, but they are in the wrong if they proceed without considering the daughter's valid concerns and without her consent. The situation requires a more nuanced approach that respects both the parent's needs and the daughter's autonomy.\n"
