I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but Ashley is upset about privacy. The parent wants to do family therapy since Ashley refuses to have sessions with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects of a therapist treating a parent and child. Therapists usually avoid dual relationships to prevent conflicts of interest. But in this case, Karla is already seeing Ashley and the parent is approaching her, and she agreed. The parent's main reasoning is that Karla is the only therapist they trust and that it could help with family therapy. \n\nAshley's concern is privacy, which is a valid point. However, the parent is respecting patient confidentiality and knows that Karla would handle it professionally. The daughter is a teenager and might be resistant to family therapy, which is common. The parent is trying to address their own issues, possibly related to their military tours, and seeing the same therapist could help bridge communication gaps.\n\nThe parent is not forcing Ashley; they just want to be seen by Karla. Since the therapist consented and there's no indication of any professional boundary issues, the parent's action seems reasonable. The daughter's resistance might stem from feeling territorial or uncomfortable with her parent knowing more about her therapy. But the parent is trying to be inclusive and open, which is a good approach. \n\nI think the key points are: the therapist's agreement, the parent's intent to engage in family therapy, and respecting confidentiality. The daughter's feelings are valid, but the parent isn't wrong for seeking help from a trusted professional. So, answer B.\n"
