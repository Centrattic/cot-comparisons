I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is a parent who wants to see the same therapist their daughter is seeing. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but the daughter is upset about her privacy being breached.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when privacy and autonomy are really important. Even though the parent might know a lot about her life, the daughter might feel that having the same therapist as her parent could make her feel uncomfortable or like she can't share certain things. Patient confidentiality is a big part of therapy, so even if the parent knows some things, the daughter might be worried that the therapist could accidentally share information or that the parent might somehow find out more than they should.\n\nThe parent mentions that the therapist is inclusive of them in the daughter's progress, but that's probably different from the parent being a direct client. The therapist might be okay with it professionally, but the daughter's feelings are valid. The parent is trying to use a family therapy approach, but the daughter is refusing sessions with the parents present. Maybe the daughter feels that having her parent in her therapy space (even as a separate client) would compromise her ability to be open.\n\nThe parent compares it to a surgeon operating on both of them, but that's a different scenario. A surgeon doesn't deal with personal, emotional issues the way a therapist does. The parent's analogy might not hold up because the relationship between a therapist and their clients is built on trust and confidentiality, which is different from a medical procedure.\n\nThe parent's intention is to seek a therapist they trust, which is understandable. But the daughter's reaction is about privacy and boundaries. The parent is pushing back because they don't see a good reason to stop, but the daughter's reasons might be more about her emotional well-being and sense of privacy. The parent might be dismissing her feelings as \"irrational or territorial,\" but that could be invalidating the daughter's perspective.\n\nIn terms of ethics, therapists usually avoid dual relationships because it can create conflicts of interest. However, the therapist here has already agreed, so maybe there's a way to manage it. Still, the daughter's discomfort is a red flag. The parent's desire to involve the therapist in family therapy is a good intention, but the daughter isn't ready for that. Forcing her to see the parent's therapist might be counterproductive and could damage the therapeutic relationship.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they might not be considering the daughter's feelings enough. The daughter's privacy and comfort are important, even if the parent has the therapist's approval. The parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's concerns, even if they come from a good place. The answer probably leans towards the parent not being in the wrong because they're seeking help and the therapist agrees, but the daughter's feelings are valid too. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The parent's actions don't necessarily violate any ethical standards, but it's a sensitive situation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with a note about respecting the daughter's feelings."
