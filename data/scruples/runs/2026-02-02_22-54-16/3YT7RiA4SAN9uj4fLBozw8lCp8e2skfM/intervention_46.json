I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The key points here are the daughter's objection, the therapist's approval, and the author's reasoning.\n\nFirst, the daughter is upset about privacy. The author acknowledges patient confidentiality, which is important. They also mention that the daughter is a troubled teen, which might make her more sensitive about personal issues. The daughter refuses family therapy and is resistant to the idea of the parent seeing the same therapist. The author argues that the therapist is the only one they trust and that it's similar to a surgeon seeing both family members. \n\nThe therapist, Karla, says there's no conflict of interest and is okay with it. So from a professional standpoint, it's acceptable. But the daughter's feelings are valid too. The author is trying to balance respecting the daughter's privacy while addressing their own needs. The daughter's resistance could stem from feeling that her private space is being invaded, even if the parent already knows a lot. The author's comparison to a surgeon might not fully address the emotional impact on the daughter.\n\nThe author is trying to encourage family therapy, which is a good step, but the daughter's refusal complicates things. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive of the daughter's feelings, even if they're trying to avoid rewarding irrational behavior. However, the therapist's endorsement is a strong point in the author's favor. \n\nSo, considering all factors: the therapist supports it, the author is trying to handle things with respect to confidentiality, and the daughter's objection is about privacy but the author isn't forcing it. The author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in addressing the daughter's concerns more empathetically. Answer B.\n"
