I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The daughter is upset about this, while the therapist, Karla, is okay with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their daughter both see Karla, a therapist they trust. The daughter is against it, citing privacy concerns. The author argues that the therapist has said it's fine and that there's no conflict of interest. They also mention wanting to use this as a step towards family therapy, which the daughter refuses. The wife and daughter think the author is at fault, but the therapist supports it.\n\nNow, evaluating from an ethical standpoint, the therapist's role is to maintain confidentiality and professional boundaries. If Karla has determined that seeing both the parent and child is appropriate, that's a professional judgment. However, the daughter's feelings about privacy are significant. Even if the therapist approves, the daughter's emotional response can't be ignored. The parent might be overstepping if they dismiss the daughter's concerns as \"territorial\" or \"irrational\" without addressing them.\n\nThe parent wants to respect the daughter's feelings but also not reward anger or irrational behavior. It's a balance between respecting boundaries and maintaining trust. The parent's argument about the surgeon analogy might not fully address the unique dynamics of therapy, where confidentiality is paramount. The daughter might feel that her privacy is compromised even if the therapist handles information appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, the parent's desire to initiate family therapy could be valid, but the daughter's refusal suggests that forcing the issue might not be beneficial. The parent's approach could be seen as disregarding the daughter's autonomy, which is a crucial aspect of adolescent development. Even if the therapist approves, the parent's insistence might be undermining the daughter's right to privacy, which is a key ethical principle in therapy.\n\nSo, while the therapist's approval is a positive sign, the parent's actions might be ethically questionable if they're not genuinely considering the daughter's perspective and the potential impact on her trust and willingness to engage in therapy. The parent's justification that they already know most things might not account for the importance of patient confidentiality and the daughter's right to self-determination in her therapeutic process.\n"
