I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves Ashley, the daughter, who has been seeing therapist Karla. The father (author) wants to see Karla too, and Karla says it's okay. But Ashley is upset about it, claiming it's a breach of her privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The therapist, Karla, is okay with seeing the father, which is important. Ethically, therapists have boundaries, so Karla's approval matters. The daughter's objection is about privacy and maybe feeling that her space is being invaded. The father is trying to get closer through family therapy since Ashley refuses sessions with him or his wife present. He compared it to a surgeon operating on both, implying it's a professional relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the daughter's feelings, the therapist's professional stance, and potential conflicts of interest. The father is acting from a place of wanting to support his daughter and possibly engage in family therapy. However, the daughter's privacy is a significant concern here. Even though the therapist is okay, the daughter might feel her confidentiality is compromised, especially if they are in the same session or if the therapist shares information inadvertently.\n\nIn therapy, confidentiality is a cornerstone. Even if the therapist is willing, if the daughter feels her privacy is at risk, that's a valid concern. The father's approach of challenging her to give a reason and dismissing her anger as \"territorial behavior\" might not be the best way to handle her feelings. He's trying to balance his desire for family therapy with respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe therapist's role here is crucial. If Karla confirmed there's no conflict of interest, then professionally it's acceptable. But from a familial standpoint, the daughter's comfort is key. The father might not be in the wrong per se, but he could be missing the emotional impact on Ashley. The answer might depend on whether the father is respecting Ashley's boundaries or just pushing through because the therapist is okay with it. \n\nAlso, comparing it to a surgeon might not be the best analogy since surgeons don't typically share personal sessions with patients. The father's analogy could be oversimplifying the trust issues in therapy. The daughter's refusal to have family therapy sessions suggests she might not feel safe or comfortable with them involved, so adding the father as a client could complicate that dynamic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the therapist's approval is important, the daughter's feelings and privacy are equally significant. The father might not be in the wrong legally or professionally, but ethically, he might be overlooking the daughter's perspective. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the therapist agreed and he's trying to engage in family therapy, but there's a nuance where respecting the daughter's privacy is also important. However, since the therapist is okay with it, the father's actions are likely appropriate, making B the answer.\n"
