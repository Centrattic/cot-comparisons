I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent arranged for her to meet Karla through the on-base hospital. Now Karla works independently and the parent wants to be her therapist too. Karla says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about the privacy breach. The parent argues that they already know a lot and that it's similar to a surgeon operating on both. The wife and daughter think the parent is in the wrong, but the parent believes Karla's professional opinion is enough.\n\nSo, the main points here: The parent's motivation is to have a trusted therapist and possibly start family therapy. However, the daughter is uncomfortable. The therapist approves, but the parent is ignoring the daughter's feelings. \n\nTherapy ethics usually emphasize confidentiality and boundaries between therapists and family members. Even though Karla is okay with it, there's a potential conflict of interest. The daughter's privacy is paramount in therapy. If the parent wants to be involved, family therapy might be a better approach, which the parent mentions. But the daughter is already resistant to that. \n\nThe parent is pushing against the daughter's wishes, which could be seen as overstepping. The daughter's privacy is protected by law and ethical standards, so the parent might not have a right to access their daughter's therapy information unless the daughter consents. The parent's reasoning about knowing similar things through their relationship isn't valid because professional confidentiality applies regardless. \n\nAlso, the parent's argument about the surgeon is flawed because a surgeon doesn't share the same level of detailed personal information as a therapist. The daughter's discomfort is valid, and the parent is dismissing her feelings as irrational or territorial. That's not respectful of the daughter's autonomy and privacy. \n\nEven though the therapist agrees, the parent should consider the daughter's feelings and find another therapist for themselves. There's a risk of blurring professional boundaries, which could affect both the therapist's ability to help the daughter and the parent's own therapy. So, the parent might be in the wrong here by not respecting the daughter's privacy and pushing their own agenda.\n"
