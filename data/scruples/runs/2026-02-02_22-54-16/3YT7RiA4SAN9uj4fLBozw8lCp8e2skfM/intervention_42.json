I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been seeing Karla for a year. The parent met Karla through the military hospital and recommended her to the daughter, who liked the group sessions and later went to individual sessions. Now Karla works independently and both the parent and the daughter are patients there. The parent asked Karla if it's okay for them to see her too, and Karla agreed. However, the daughter is upset about this, thinking it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that they already know a lot and that patient confidentiality should cover the rest. They also mention the daughter being \"troubled\" and wanting to start family therapy, which the daughter refuses. The wife and daughter think the parent is in the wrong, but the therapist thinks it's fine.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent is wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks the parent isn't in the wrong. Let me consider the key points here.\n\nTherapeutic boundaries are important. Therapists typically have guidelines about treating multiple family members. If Karla is okay with it, and it's within professional ethics, then maybe it's acceptable. The parent isn't using the daughter's information for personal gain, just seeking help themselves. The daughter's privacy is a concern, but patient confidentiality should protect her. The parent is trying to approach family therapy, which the daughter resists. The parent is asserting their right to seek care, which is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the daughter's feelings of privacy invasion are valid. Even though the parent might know a lot, the daughter might feel exposed. The parent should respect her feelings, but the therapist's approval suggests it's professionally acceptable. The parent isn't forcing the daughter to be in sessions together, just seeking their own therapy. The parent's reasoning about the surgeon analogy makes sense in terms of shared care, but it's different because a surgeon is a medical professional and therapist is more personal.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong because they consulted the therapist and got approval, and they're not violating confidentiality. The daughter's concerns are valid, but the parent's decision is within their right to seek therapy. The therapist's okay is a key point. So the answer is B.\n"
