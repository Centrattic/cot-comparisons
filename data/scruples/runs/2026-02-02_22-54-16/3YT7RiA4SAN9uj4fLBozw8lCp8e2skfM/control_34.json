I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect.

She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's daughter, Ashley, has been seeing a therapist named Karla for a year. The author initially recommended Karla to Ashley when Karla worked at their military hospital. Now Karla works independently, and the author wants to see her too. The therapist said it's okay and there's no conflict of interest. However, Ashley is upset about this, thinking it's a breach of privacy. The author acknowledges patient confidentiality but thinks Ashley is being territorial or irrational. The wife and daughter both think the author is at fault (TA), but the author believes the therapist's approval is enough.\n\nFirst, the key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let's break down the factors involved.\n\n1. **Therapist's Approval**: Karla, the therapist, is okay with seeing both the author and Ashley. She's even been inclusive with the author regarding Ashley's progress. Since she's a professional, her assessment that there's no conflict of interest is significant. Therapists are trained to recognize potential issues, so her approval might be a strong point in the author's favor.\n\n2. **Privacy Concerns**: Ashley feels her privacy is being breached. Even though the author reminds her of patient confidentiality, which is important, the mere fact that the parent will be in the same therapist's practice could make Ashley uncomfortable. Teenagers often value privacy, especially when dealing with personal issues. The author might not realize how important this boundary is for Ashley's trust and comfort in therapy.\n\n3. **Power Dynamics and Comfort**: Therapy is a space where the patient must feel safe. If Ashley feels her privacy is compromised, it could affect her openness in sessions. The author's decision could inadvertently undermine the therapeutic relationship, even if the therapist thinks it's okay. The therapist might have the training to manage this, but the patient's comfort is still crucial.\n\n4. **Author's Intentions**: The author wants family therapy but Ashley refuses. The author sees the situation as similar to being operated on by the same surgeon, but therapy is different because of the emotional and psychological aspects. The comparison to surgery might not hold because the dynamics of trust and vulnerability in therapy are unique.\n\n5. **Family Dynamics**: The author and wife think the daughter is being irrational or territorial. However, teenagers might act out due to stress or past experiences. The author's approach of challenging Ashley to give reasons might not be effective if she's not ready to articulate them. The author might be dismissing her feelings as anger rather than understanding the underlying issues.\n\n6. **Professional Boundaries**: Even if the therapist agrees, the author's role as a parent could complicate things. The therapist might need to manage interactions between parent and child, which could be complex. The author might not have considered how their presence could affect Ashley's willingness to discuss certain topics.\n\nPutting this together, the therapist's approval is a pro for the author, but the daughter's privacy concerns are significant. The author's actions might be well-intentioned, but they could infringe on Ashley's need for a confidential space. The key is whether the author respects Ashley's boundaries despite their own needs. Even if the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's feelings are valid and should be considered. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in a strict sense, but they might be overlooking the importance of maintaining Ashley's trust and privacy. However, since the therapist is okay with it and the author is acting on professional advice, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here where the author's insistence could still be problematic. But given the therapist's approval and the author's good intentions, the answer might be B. Alternatively, if the focus is on respecting Ashley's privacy, then A. Hmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the therapist is okay with it, but the daughter is upset, it's a balance. The author is not violating any rules, but they might be dismissing the daughter's valid feelings. So maybe A (in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing their needs over the daughter's privacy, even if the therapist says it's okay. But I'm a bit torn here. Let me think again. The therapist is a professional and okay with it, so the author isn't doing something unethical. However, the daughter's feelings are important. The author might not be in the wrong, but they need to be sensitive. The question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer is B because the author isn't violating any rules and the therapist approves, even if the daughter is upset. So, B.\n"
