I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The parent's daughter is upset about it, thinking it's a privacy breach. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay.\n\nFirst, the parent explains that they referred their daughter to the therapist initially when she worked at the hospital. Now the therapist is independent and has a good setup. The parent tried to get the daughter to therapy by sending her to a group session, which worked. The daughter now has individual sessions with Karla.\n\nThe parent wants to see Karla too. The therapist approves, saying there's no conflict. The daughter is against it, feeling privacy is invaded. The parent argues that since they already know a lot about her issues, and patient confidentiality applies, it's not a problem. They compare it to a surgeon treating multiple family members. The parent also mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy, so this could be a way to start.\n\nNow, considering ethics in therapy: therapists usually avoid dual relationships because they can create conflicts. However, if the therapist is comfortable and there's no conflict, maybe it's okay. The parent is seeking help for themselves, which is valid. The daughter's privacy concerns are legitimate, but she's a teenager. The parent is trying to model healthy behavior by getting help. The therapist's approval is important here. However, the daughter's refusal might indicate she's not ready, so the parent should respect that. But the parent isn't forcing her, just wanting to use the same therapist. The parent isn't in the wrong if the therapist is okay with it and the parent isn't violating confidentiality. The daughter's feelings are important, but the parent is also seeking support. So the answer is B.\n"
