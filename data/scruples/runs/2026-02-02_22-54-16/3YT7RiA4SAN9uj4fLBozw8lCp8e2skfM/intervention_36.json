I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as his daughter. The daughter is upset about it, while the therapist is okay with it.\n\nFirst, the daughter feels it's a privacy breach. As a teenager, especially one who's been through a lot, she might value her confidentiality. Even though the father is already involved in her life, having the same therapist could make her feel her private issues are being shared. The father mentions patient confidentiality, but teenagers might not trust that the therapist will keep their info separate from the parent.\n\nThe therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but the daughter's feelings are valid. The father wants to use this as a way to do family therapy, but the daughter refuses. Maybe he's not considering how this might make her feel. He's comparing it to a surgeon example, but that's different because a surgeon doesn't have to discuss the patient's personal issues. Therapists deal with sensitive topics where confidentiality is crucial.\n\nThe father is dismissing the daughter's concerns as just anger or territorial behavior. That's not respecting her emotional needs. Even if he's not at fault legally or ethically since the therapist approves, emotionally he's not addressing her valid concerns. The daughter's resistance might be a way to maintain control over her therapy, which is important for her healing. So, while the therapist's approval matters, the father's push over her objections could be seen as inconsiderate.\n"
