So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the letter) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a gym machine by someone older, and the nephew declined. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, but the author disagreed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core of the issue. The nephew was using a gym machine and an older man asked him to move. The nephew didn't want to stop his workout, so he refused. The parents felt he should yield because of the man's age, but the author thinks that's not valid reasoning. \n\nThe main point here is whether age should dictate who gets to use a gym machine. The author argues that both have equal right to work out, regardless of age. The parents used \"respect your elders\" as a justification. But in a public gym setting, the rules are usually based on availability and etiquette rather than age. If the machine was in use, the other person would typically wait their turn or ask politely. The nephew wasn't doing anything wrong by continuing his workout unless he was blocking access. \n\nThe author's stance is about fairness and equality. However, they might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, the nephew's father. Family dynamics matter here\u2014advising the nephew in front of his parents could be seen as undermining their authority. So while the author's reasoning is sound, the way they expressed their support might have been inappropriate in a family setting. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents' argument is based on traditional hierarchy (respecting elders), which might not apply in this context. The author isn't in the wrong for supporting the nephew's right to finish his workout, but they might have handled the situation differently. The key is whether the nephew was actually at fault. If the gym rules are first-come-first-served, then the nephew was correct to stay. The author defending that is correct. But the conflict arises from the public disagreement and the parents' authority. So the answer depends on context: the author's reasoning is right, but their approach might have been wrong.\n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. The parents' authority is part of that. So if the author publicly sided with the nephew, that could be seen as disrespectful to the brother. However, the author's belief that the nephew was right is justified. The answer might be B (No), but with the note that the approach could have been better. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) if the author should have let the parents handle it without publicly disagreeing.\n"
