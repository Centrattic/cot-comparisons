So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement about whether the nephew was right to not move from a gym machine when an older man asked him.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The nephew was using a machine, and a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger, implying the older person's workout is more important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter here.\n\nThe key points are: fairness in gym etiquette, the nephew's right to finish his workout, and the parents' reasoning based on age. The author sided with the nephew, challenging the idea that age dictates priority in this context. \n\nGym etiquette usually follows the principle of \"first come, first served.\" If the nephew was already using the machine, the person waiting would have to wait until he's done. The parents' argument that the older person's workout is more important because of age doesn't logically hold. Age doesn't determine who gets to use equipment first. \n\nThe author's stance is based on fairness and equal rights, which makes sense. However, they might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, which could have caused tension. But the reasoning behind their disagreement is valid. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting the nephew's correct action based on fair gym etiquette. The parents' reasoning was flawed, so siding with the nephew was appropriate. The answer should be B.\n"
