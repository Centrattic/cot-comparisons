So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for supporting their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew refusing to move from a gym machine when an older man asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend side with the parents, arguing that the nephew was wrong because he's younger. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: was the nephew in the wrong? The scenario is that the nephew was using a machine and refused a request to move. Generally, in a gym setting, people are there to work out, and if someone is using a machine, they can stay until they finish their set. However, if someone is done and another person is waiting, it's polite to yield. But in this case, the nephew wasn't done, so he had the right to stay. The man's request might not have been respectful, and the nephew's refusal is reasonable.\n\nThe parents' reasoning is that the nephew was younger, so his workout was less important. The author correctly points out that age shouldn't determine the value of someone's workout. Both are trying to get fit, so neither should be prioritized based on age. The author's support of the nephew isn't about being disrespectful but about the fairness of the situation.\n\nNow, the author's conflict is with their brother for not respecting authority or something. But the author wasn't the parent, so they weren't overstepping by challenging an unfair point. The key here is whether the author was wrong for disagreeing with their brother. Since the author's argument is based on fairness and equality, it's not wrong to support the nephew. The author's brother's emphasis on \"respecting elders\" is a cultural norm, but that doesn't mean the nephew was wrong in this case. The author isn't in the wrong for defending a fair point. So the answer should be B.\n"
