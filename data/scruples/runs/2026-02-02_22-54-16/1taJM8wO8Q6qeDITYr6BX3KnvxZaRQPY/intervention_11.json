So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with his nephew during a family dinner. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong, arguing that since he's younger, the older man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, saying age shouldn't matter, and now he's getting flak from his brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The gym is a shared space. Usually, etiquette might suggest that if someone is done with a machine, they should move so others can use it. But the nephew was still using it, so maybe he wasn't obligated to leave. However, the situation might depend on gym rules. If the gym allows users to keep a machine for a certain amount of time, or if there's a queue system, that could affect things.\n\nThe parents' reasoning was based on age\u2014since the nephew is younger, his workout was less important. That feels a bit arbitrary. Why does age determine the value of someone's workout? Both are there to exercise, so their needs are equally valid. The author's stance that age shouldn't factor in makes sense logically.\n\nBut family dynamics matter too. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in and disagreeing with the nephew's parents might have caused tension. The brother was upset because the author didn't support his parenting. Even if the author is right about the gym situation, the way he expressed his disagreement could have been a problem. Publicly disagreeing with a sibling in front of others can be seen as disrespectful, which might explain why the brother is upset.\n\nSo, the author's argument on the ethics of the situation might be valid, but the social aspect\u2014how he handled it in front of family\u2014could be where he went wrong. The question is whether the \"wrong\" is about the gym incident or the family conflict. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the answer depends on whether the focus is on the moral judgment of the nephew's actions or the interpersonal conflict with the brother.\n\nIf the focus is on the nephew's actions, the author isn't wrong. But if it's about the conflict with the brother, maybe the author's approach was inconsiderate. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but the answer should consider both angles. However, the main question is about the author's stance in the situation, not just the family fallout. Since the nephew's parents were using age as a rationale which is flawed, the author's support for the nephew is justified. The family conflict is a consequence but doesn't necessarily make the author wrong about the initial issue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
