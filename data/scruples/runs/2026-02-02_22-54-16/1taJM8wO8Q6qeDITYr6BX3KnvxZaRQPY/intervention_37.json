So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a family dinner where the nephew had a disagreement with a man at the gym. The nephew refused to move from a machine when asked by a 30-year-old man. The parents (the author's brother and sister-in-law) said the nephew was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter here, and sides with the nephew. Then, the brother is upset with the author for not respecting elders.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The nephew was using a machine and wasn't done. The 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew declined, which the parents saw as disrespectful because of the man's age. The author argues that age doesn't determine the importance of a workout. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for supporting the nephew? Well, the main issue here is whether the nephew was in the wrong. Gym etiquette usually suggests that if someone is using a machine, they should finish their set before moving. However, if the machine is being held for too long, others might expect to take a turn. But in this case, the nephew wasn't done, so he didn't have to leave. The parents' reasoning was based on age, which the author correctly points out is irrelevant. The author is standing by the idea that both parties have equal right to the machine regardless of age, which is a valid point.\n\nBut the author's brother is upset because the author didn't respect the elders. The family dynamic here is important. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so maybe they overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the parents. However, the author's argument isn't about disrespecting the man at the gym but rather the parents' reasoning. The parents may have been using an age-based hierarchy, which the author rightly challenges. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for supporting the nephew's right to finish his workout. However, they might have handled the situation more diplomatically to avoid conflict with their brother. But in terms of the actual issue, the author's stance is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
