So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym, using a machine when a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying the older man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context. Then, the brother (the nephew's father) criticized the author for not respecting the nephew's parents and for taking his side.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author was wrong to support their nephew against the nephew's parents. The author isn't the parent, so they might be overstepping in a family setting. However, the parents' reasoning (that age determines the importance of a workout) seems flawed. The author's argument is that both parties were there to benefit their health, and age shouldn't dictate who has to move first.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, family dynamics matter. The nephew's parents are his guardians, and challenging their authority in front of them could be seen as disrespectful, especially if the author isn't the parent. But the parents' reasoning is questionable. Gym etiquette usually follows first-come-first-served, unless there's a specific protocol. The nephew was using the machine and wasn't done, so it's reasonable for him to finish. The parents' argument that age matters doesn't hold because there's no rule that older people get priority in the gym.\n\nSo, the author's support for the nephew is based on logical reasoning, but the method of doing so in a family gathering might have been inappropriate. The author's actions could have been better handled privately, but the disagreement on the parents' reasoning isn't necessarily wrong. The key is whether the parents were right to reprimand the nephew for not moving. If the nephew was in the right, the author supporting him is also in the right. However, the context of family respect and the author's role as a non-parent might make the situation more complex.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasoning is sound, but the way they expressed their disagreement might have been inappropriate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since their support for the nephew was based on valid reasoning and the parents' argument was flawed, the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents' stance was incorrect, so supporting the nephew isn't wrong, even if the manner was awkward.\n"
