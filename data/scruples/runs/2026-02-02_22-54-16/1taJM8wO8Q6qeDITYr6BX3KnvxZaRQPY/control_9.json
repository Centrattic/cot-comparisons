So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a conflict between the nephew and another person at the gym. The nephew was using a machine when a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done, and his parents argued that he was wrong because he's younger. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't determine whose workout is more important. Then the brother gets upset with the author for not respecting the elders.\n\nFirst, the core issue is about who has the right to use the gym equipment. The nephew was using the machine, so logically, he should have the right to finish his set. The 30-year-old might have wanted to use it, but that doesn't automatically mean the nephew should give up his spot unless there's a queue system or some unspoken rule. However, gyms often have implicit rules about taking turns. If the machine is busy, people usually wait or ask to switch after a few minutes. The nephew's refusal might have been rude, but if there's no sign of him finishing soon, maybe the 30-year-old's request was reasonable.\n\nBut the parents' reasoning is based on age, which the author correctly points out is irrelevant. Age doesn't determine the importance of a workout. Both parties have equal rights to use the equipment. So the parents are wrong in their reasoning. The author siding with the nephew is defending a valid point here.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author is not the nephew's parent, so they didn't overstep by disagreeing with the parents? Well, maybe in the context of family dynamics, the brother might feel disrespected if the author challenges his parenting in front of others. The author might have been right in the logic but wrong in the approach. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the approach. The main argument is about the nephew's actions and the parents' justification.\n\nSo the author's stance that the nephew wasn't wrong and the parents' reasoning is flawed makes sense. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
