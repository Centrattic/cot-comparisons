So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. \n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend agreed the nephew was wrong because he's younger and thus his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up siding with the nephew. The brother then accused the author of being wrong for not respecting elders.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n1. The nephew was using the machine and wasn't done, so he had the right to stay until he finished. \n2. The parents' reasoning was based on the nephew's age, implying that the older person's workout is more important. \n3. The author challenged this reasoning, which led to conflict with the brother.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, when someone is using a machine, it's generally understood that they can finish their set before others take over. The idea that age determines the importance of one's workout is questionable. The author's stance seems to be on the side of equal respect for everyone's time, regardless of age. \n\nHowever, in some cultural contexts, \"respect your elders\" is a strong principle. The brother might feel that the author undermined this cultural norm, leading to the conflict. But the nephew wasn't disrespectful; he was just following typical gym etiquette by finishing his workout. The author's disagreement with the parents' reasoning might be seen as standing up for fairness rather than disrespect.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether you prioritize the cultural value of respecting elders over the practical aspect of gym etiquette. The author didn't do anything wrong in defending the nephew's right to finish his workout. The brother's reaction might be more about authority and family dynamics than the actual issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
