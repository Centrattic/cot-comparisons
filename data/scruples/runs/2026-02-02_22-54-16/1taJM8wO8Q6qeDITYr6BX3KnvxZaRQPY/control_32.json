So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (TA) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident. The situation involves the nephew refusing to move from a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him. The nephew's parents and girlfriend argued that the nephew was wrong because he's younger and thus his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the scenario. The nephew was using a gym machine and was asked to move. He said he wasn't done yet, so he declined. The parents' reasoning was based on the nephew's age, suggesting that the older man's workout is more important. The author found this reasoning flawed.\n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, age shouldn't determine who gets to use a gym machine. The key point is about respecting personal time and the right to complete a workout. The nephew was in the middle of his exercise, and the older man's request to move was perhaps based on a different understanding of gym etiquette. In most gym environments, it's considered polite to not hog machines for too long, but that's more about time than age. If the nephew was still using the machine and hadn't finished, the older man's request might be seen as premature. However, the nephew's refusal could be seen as impolite if the machine was being used for an extended period without yielding, even if it's not based on age.\n\nThe author's disagreement with the parents' reasoning seems valid because age isn't a factor in the importance of one's workout. However, the way the author expressed their disagreement might have been a point of contention. The parents might feel that the author was undermining them in front of others, which could be why they took offense. The author could be in the wrong for not respecting the authority of the nephew's parents in a family setting, even if their argument was logical. It's a balance between being right about the principle and respecting family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew's parents made a judgment based on age, which is a flawed premise. The author's support might be justified in challenging that bias. The real issue is whether the author overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the parents. In family settings, especially with children, parents might expect support. The author is not the nephew's parent, but their public disagreement could have been seen as disrespectful to the parents.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on the context of family interactions. If the author's disagreement was constructive and not disrespectful, they might not be in the wrong. But if their manner of siding with the nephew was confrontational or undermined the parents, then they could be. The question is whether the author was wrong in their stance or in their approach. The user mentions that after dinner, their brother started talking shit, implying the author's approach was problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it rather than the stance itself. But the initial question is about siding with the nephew, not the manner. However, family dynamics often consider the approach as part of the issue. So the answer could be A (yes) if the author's public disagreement and support for the nephew disrespected the parents. Alternatively, if the author's reasoning is sound and the parents were wrong, then B (no). It's a bit tricky, but I think the key here is that the author is not the parent and may have overstepped by publicly challenging the parents' judgment. So the answer might be A.\n"
