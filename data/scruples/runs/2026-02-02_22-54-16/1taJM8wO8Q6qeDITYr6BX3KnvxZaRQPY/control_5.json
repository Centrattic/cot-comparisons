So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong, arguing that the man was older and thus his workout was more important. The author disagreed, supporting the nephew, which led to conflict with the brother and brother's wife.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about whether the nephew did something wrong by not moving. The parents' reasoning is based on age as a factor\u2014older person's workout being more important. The author and nephew argue that age doesn't determine the importance of the workout. \n\nIs the nephew in the wrong? If the machine wasn't being shared and the nephew was using it, then he wasn't obligated to move. Gym etiquette usually suggests that if someone is using a machine, you wait for them to finish. However, some places might have rules about time limits. But in this case, there's no mention of that. The parents' argument that age matters is questionable because age doesn't determine gym priority. So the nephew might be in the right. \n\nThe author supported the nephew. The parents felt disrespected because their authority was challenged. The author might have overstepped by not staying neutral, but the parents' reasoning was flawed. \n\nIn terms of the author's actions: They expressed their opinion, which is their right. However, they might have caused tension by not staying neutral. But the parents' argument was based on an incorrect premise. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their support was justified. Since the nephew wasn't wrong, the author's support isn't wrong. The parents' reasoning was flawed. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
