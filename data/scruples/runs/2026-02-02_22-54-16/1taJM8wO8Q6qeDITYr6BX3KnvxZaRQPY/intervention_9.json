So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement over gym etiquette between the nephew and a 30-year-old man. The nephew was using a machine and didn't move when asked, leading his parents and the author's girlfriend to side with the man, arguing that the nephew was wrong because he's younger. The author disagrees, thinking that age shouldn't matter here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the gym scenario. In most gyms, the general rule is that if someone is using a machine, they have the right to finish their set before another person uses it. So the nephew's refusal to move immediately is actually in line with standard gym etiquette. The parents' argument that age determines who should yield is a bit odd because, in reality, gyms don't typically prioritize older individuals over younger ones in that way. Age doesn't inherently make one person's workout more important than another's unless there are specific circumstances, which weren't mentioned here.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The author is not the nephew's parent, so they might be overstepping by publicly disagreeing with the parents. However, the author is supporting their nephew's correct understanding of gym etiquette. The parents' reasoning seems flawed, so the author's stance isn't just about taking a side but about correcting a wrong assumption. \n\nThe brother's reaction is also a point. He's upset because the author didn't respect his authority or the idea of respecting elders. But the author's argument isn't about disrespecting elders per se; it's about the validity of the parents' reasoning. The key here is whether the author was right to correct a factual misunderstanding (gym etiquette and the role of age) even if it caused tension. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while respecting elders is culturally important, it shouldn't override clear rules about shared spaces like a gym. The author's position is based on fairness and correct gym behavior, not on disrespecting authority. Therefore, the author's disagreement is justified. However, the way the author expressed their disagreement might have been a social misstep, but the core argument isn't wrong. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting their nephew's right to finish his workout and challenging the parents' incorrect reasoning. The answer should be B.\n"
