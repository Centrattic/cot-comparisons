So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is during a family dinner, the nephew was working out at the gym and someone older asked him to move. The nephew didn't move, and his parents said he did wrong because he's younger, so the older person's workout was more important. The author sides with the nephew, thinking age shouldn't determine gym priority, but then the brother got upset, saying the author was wrong for not respecting elders.\n\nHmm, first, the main issue is whether the nephew was in the wrong for not moving. The nephew was using the machine, so logically, he should finish his set before someone else uses it, unless there's a rule that people yield to older individuals. But the parents argued that age matters, which the author disagrees with. The author thinks that both workouts are equally important regardless of age. \n\nSo, in general, gyms usually operate on a first-come, first-served basis. If the nephew was already using the machine, he has the right to finish before someone else. The older person might have had a right to be upset, but the nephew wasn't in the wrong. The parents' reasoning seems flawed because age shouldn't dictate gym etiquette. The author's support for the nephew is based on fairness, which makes sense. \n\nThe brother is upset that the author didn't respect him (as a parent) in front of his family. However, the author was defending what they believed was right, not necessarily being disrespectful. Maybe the way the author expressed their disagreement could have been smoother, but the principle stands. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they shouldn't be expected to support the parents' decision without question. Their disagreement is valid if they think the parents were wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were standing up for a fair principle. So the answer should be B.\n"
