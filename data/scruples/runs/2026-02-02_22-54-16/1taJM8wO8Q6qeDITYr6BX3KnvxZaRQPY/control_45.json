So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about the gym incident. \n\nFirst, the nephew was using a machine and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong, arguing that age matters and the older man's workout was more important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't dictate who moves.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and respect. The nephew had a right to use the machine until he finished, regardless of age. The parents' reasoning that the nephew should yield because he's younger might not be valid. The author supported the nephew, which goes against the parents' view but aligns with the idea that everyone should be treated equally in such situations.\n\nThe author's brother and others criticized them for not respecting elders. However, the situation isn't about disrespecting someone because of age but about equal access to gym equipment. The author's stance seems reasonable, prioritizing fairness over age-based hierarchy.\n\nThe author's concern about disrespecting their brother is valid, but the main issue is whether the nephew did wrong. Since the nephew was in his right not to move until done, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting him. The parents' argument based on age doesn't hold in this context. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
