So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement over gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using a machine and another man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine who moves.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to side with the nephew. The parents used the \"respect your elders\" argument. But is that a valid reason? In gym settings, the general rule is that whoever is using the equipment has the right to continue until they're done, regardless of age. So, the nephew's action wasn't wrong. The author's defense of the nephew seems reasonable here. \n\nHowever, the author's brother felt disrespected because the author disagreed with him in front of others. That's a family dynamic issue. The author might have overstepped by not letting the brother handle his own child, but in terms of the actual situation, the nephew's actions were justified. The author's stance isn't necessarily wrong, but the way they intervened might have been tactless. Still, the core issue is about the rightness of the nephew's action, which the author supported correctly. So, the answer is B.\n"
