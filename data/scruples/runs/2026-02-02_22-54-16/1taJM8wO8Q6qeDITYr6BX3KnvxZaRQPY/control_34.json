So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old, which he refused. The parents and girlfriend agreed the nephew was wrong because the other person was older, but the author thinks that's not a valid reason.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The nephew was using a machine, someone asked him to move, he said no, and the parents are saying he was wrong because the other person is older. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter here. The brother then gets upset, using \"respect your elders\" as a reason.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the nephew. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so maybe they overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the parents. But the reasoning is about fairness and age not determining workout importance. \n\nI should consider cultural norms. In some cultures, respecting elders is a big deal, so the author might have gone against that expectation. However, the author's argument is that both people have equal right to use the machine regardless of age. The nephew was in the right for not moving if he wasn't done, so the parents' reasoning is flawed. \n\nThe author's mistake might be not considering the family dynamics and stepping in, even though their reasoning is sound. The brother felt disrespected, so the author might have caused tension. But the actual situation about the gym is a valid point. \n\nSo, the author's stance on the issue isn't wrong, but their action of publicly siding might have been poor. However, the question is if they are in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the content of their argument is flawed. Since the parents' reasoning is based on age, which is a fallacy, the author is right to challenge that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting the nephew. Answer B."
