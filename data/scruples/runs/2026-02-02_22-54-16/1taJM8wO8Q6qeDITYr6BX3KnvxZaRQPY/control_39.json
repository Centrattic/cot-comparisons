So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine, and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew declined because he wasn't done. The parents and the author's girlfriend thought the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't affect the importance of a workout.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault for supporting the nephew. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the analysis.\n\nLet me consider the key points. The nephew was using a machine and wasn't done. The other person asked him to move, but the nephew had the right to finish his workout unless there was a specific rule against that. The parents argued that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, which the author finds illogical. The author supported the nephew, which led to conflict with their brother and girlfriend.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the nephew wasn't obligated to move just because someone else asked. Unless the gym has a policy that requires people to move when asked, the nephew's action was reasonable. The parents' reasoning based on age seems flawed because the importance of a workout isn't determined by age. The author's support for the nephew was standing up for logical and fair treatment, which isn't wrong.\n\nHowever, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, especially since they aren't the nephew's parent. But the issue here is the validity of the parents' argument, not the author's right to express their opinion. The author isn't in the wrong for supporting a fair perspective. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
