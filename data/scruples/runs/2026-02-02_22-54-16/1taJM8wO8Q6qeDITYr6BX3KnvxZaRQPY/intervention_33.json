So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident. \n\nFirst, the nephew was using a machine at the gym when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew didn't move because he wasn't done. The parents and the girlfriend argued that the nephew was wrong since he's younger, implying that the older man's workout is more important. The author disagreed, stating that age shouldn't dictate who has priority at the gym.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: \n1. The nephew was using the machine and not done yet.\n2. The parents' reasoning is based on age, which the author finds flawed.\n3. The author publicly disagreed with their brother, leading to tension.\n\nThe nephew had a right to finish his workout without being forced to move. Age isn't a valid reason to prioritize one person's use of a gym machine over another. The author is supporting their nephew's right to use the equipment until he's done, which is reasonable. However, the author is not the nephew's parent, so stepping in during a family discussion might be seen as overstepping, but the parents' reasoning is questionable. The conflict arises from the author defending the nephew and clashing with their brother, who emphasizes respecting elders. \n\nRespecting elders is a cultural norm, but in this context, the situation is about gym etiquette, not respect. The author's intervention was based on fairness rather than disrespect. So while the author might feel they caused tension, their stance on the issue isn't necessarily wrong. The parents might have overemphasized age over the nephew's right to finish his workout. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
