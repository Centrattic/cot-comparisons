So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family dinner where the nephew was working out at the gym and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused, and his parents and the author's girlfriend sided with the man, arguing that because the nephew is younger, his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking that age shouldn't matter. Then the brother got upset, saying the author was wrong for disrespecting him in front of others. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The nephew was using a machine and was asked by someone older to move. He didn't comply, and his parents thought he was wrong. The author defended the nephew. The parents' reasoning was based on the idea that older people's needs are more important, which the author found flawed. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to side with the nephew. I need to consider if the nephew's actions were justified. When someone is using a gym machine, it's customary to wait until they finish before asking them to move. However, gyms often have unspoken rules where people might ask others to move if they're waiting. But in this case, the nephew wasn't done, so he had the right to continue. The parents' argument about age seems arbitrary\u2014there's no rule that older people get priority in the gym. The author's defense is logical because respect shouldn't be based on age in this context. However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother, which could be seen as disrespectful. But the core of the argument is about the rightness of the nephew's action versus the parents' reasoning.\n\nThe brother's reaction about \"respect your elders\" is a traditional viewpoint, but the author's stance is that age isn't a valid reason here. The author isn't wrong for standing up for the nephew if they believe the reasoning is flawed. However, the way they expressed their disagreement might have been a problem, especially in front of others. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the stance itself. Since the author's reasoning makes sense, they might not be in the wrong. However, the brother felt disrespected, which complicates things. But the core issue is about the nephew's right to use the machine, not just about age. So the author's position is valid. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
