So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family dinner where the nephew had a disagreement at the gym with a 30-year-old man. The nephew was using a machine and refused to move when asked, and his parents (the author's brother and sister-in-law) are saying he was wrong because he's younger, so the older man's workout was more important. The author sided with the nephew, arguing that age doesn't determine the importance of a workout, and now the brother is upset, saying the author was wrong for not respecting elders. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the main points. The nephew was using a machine and refused to move when someone asked him. The parents are telling him he was wrong because the other person is older. The author disagrees, thinking that age shouldn't matter here. \n\nIn terms of the gym situation, usually, when someone is using a machine, others might wait their turn. But if the nephew wasn't done, he's entitled to finish his set. However, the 30-year-old man asking him to move might have thought the nephew was taking too long. But the nephew's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. The parents' reasoning is based on age, implying that older people's time is more valuable, which the author rightly points out as arbitrary. \n\nNow, the family dynamics: the author is not the nephew's parent, so stepping in during a parent's reprimand might be seen as overstepping. But the author's argument is about fairness. The brother is upset because the author publicly disagreed with him, possibly causing a rift. However, the author's stance was based on a valid point about age not determining importance. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to side with the nephew. The parents' reasoning is flawed, so the author's disagreement isn't necessarily wrong. The brother's reaction might be more about the author challenging his authority rather than the actual issue. The author might not be in the wrong for standing by a reasonable point, even if it caused family tension. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural aspect here, like \"respect your elders\" being a family value. If the author's public disagreement went against that, it could be seen as disrespectful. However, the issue isn't about the author being disrespectful to the brother per se, but the author's support for the nephew. The brother might feel that the author undermined his parenting. \n\nIn summary, the author's stance on the issue is reasonable, but the way they took sides in front of the family might be problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the arguments about age are unfounded, the author's position is justified. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
