So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation is about the nephew being asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old man. The nephew refused, and his parents and girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger, so his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed and ended up clashing with their brother and sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue. The nephew was using a machine when someone asked him to move. He didn't finish his workout. The parents' reasoning was that since the nephew is younger, the older person's workout matters more. The author thinks this is wrong, arguing that age doesn't determine the importance of a workout.\n\nSo, is the author right? Well, in a gym setting, etiquette usually involves sharing equipment. If someone is done, they move, but if they're still using it, they can finish. However, the situation might depend on whether the machine is a fixed one that only one person can use at a time. If the nephew was on a machine that the other person also wanted to use, then the nephew was in the right to finish his set. But if it's a free weight or something where you can share, maybe the etiquette is different. The problem here is the parents' reasoning based on age. The author is right to question that logic because age shouldn't determine who gets to use the equipment first. The actual issue is whether the nephew was respectful and followed gym rules. If he was just finishing his set, he's entitled to do so. The parents might be overemphasizing the age aspect, which is a flawed argument. The author defended their nephew correctly by pointing out the flaw in the parents' reasoning. However, in a family setting, the author is not the parent, so stepping in might have been unwise. But the reasoning itself isn't wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for disagreeing with the parents' age-based argument. The main conflict is between the parents' misguided reasoning and the nephew's correct action. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
