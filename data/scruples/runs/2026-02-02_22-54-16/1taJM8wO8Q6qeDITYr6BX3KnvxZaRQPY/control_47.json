So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion.\n\nSo the situation: The nephew was at the gym and someone older asked him to move off a machine. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and girlfriend think he was wrong because the man was older, implying that respect for elders should make the younger person move. The author disagrees, arguing that age shouldn't determine who has priority at the gym. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The nephew was using the machine and wasn't finished. The older man asked him to move, and the nephew didn't. The parents are using the \"respect your elders\" argument. The author is taking the nephew's side because they think age shouldn't matter in this context.\n\nIs the author wrong for their opinion? Well, the author's reasoning seems logical. At a gym, the general rule is that if someone is using equipment and not done, others should wait. It's about who is currently using it, not their age. The parents are applying a social norm (respecting elders) to a situation where the rules are more about the immediate context (equipment usage). \n\nBut the author is stepping into another family's parenting decision. They're not the nephew's parent, so maybe they overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother. The brother felt disrespected, which is a valid feeling. The author might be in the right regarding the reasoning but in the wrong for how they expressed it, especially in front of their brother.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the nephew's right to finish his workout and the author's support. The author's reasoning is sound, but the manner of expressing it might have been inappropriate. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the method. Since the author's stance is justified, they might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, the way they expressed it could be the issue. The original question is about the author's position being wrong, not the delivery. \n\nSo, if the author's reasoning is correct (age doesn't matter in gym priority), then they aren't wrong in their opinion. However, if they caused family tension by not staying neutral, maybe they are in the wrong in terms of family dynamics. But the question is about the author's position on the matter, not their method. So the answer would be B (No), because the author's reasoning is correct.\n"
