So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. \n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him. The nephew's parents and girlfriend think he was wrong because he's younger and should respect the older person. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't determine who gets to use the equipment. Then, the author's brother is upset because he feels the author disrespected him in front of the nephew.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to take the nephew's side. \n\nLooking at the gym scenario: The nephew was using a machine, and the 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents' reasoning is that the nephew was younger, so his workout was less important. The author argues that age doesn't make one workout more important. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the gym etiquette usually suggests that people should share equipment and maybe let someone else use it if they're done. But in this case, the nephew wasn't done, so he wasn't obligated to move. The parents might be emphasizing respecting elders, but the author's point is that age shouldn't matter in this context. \n\nThe author's actions: They expressed their disagreement with the parents and the girlfriend during dinner. The brother felt disrespected. The author acknowledges they're not the nephew's parent and maybe overstepped. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, when it comes to family dynamics, taking a side can be tricky. The author might have been right in their reasoning but perhaps could have handled the discussion more diplomatically. However, the actual issue of whether the nephew did something wrong is debatable. The nephew wasn't necessarily in the wrong for not moving if he wasn't done. The parents might be pushing a \"respect your elders\" mindset, but the author's argument is valid. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for supporting their nephew's actions. The real issue is the parents' reasoning based on age. The author's disagreement is justified, but the way they expressed it might have caused tension. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong, not about the handling of the situation. Since the nephew's action of not moving while using the machine isn't inherently wrong, the author's support for him isn't wrong either. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
