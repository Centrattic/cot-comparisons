So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family dinner where the nephew had a disagreement at the gym with someone older. The nephew didn't move when asked, and his parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because of his age. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up siding with the nephew. The brother and others were upset, so now the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue. The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew refused, leading to a conflict. The parents and girlfriend argued that the nephew was wrong because he was younger, implying that the older person's workout should take precedence. The author believes that age shouldn't determine who gets to use the equipment, and that both have equal right to work out.\n\nSo, the main question is whether siding with the nephew was wrong. From a fairness standpoint, it seems reasonable that someone using a machine has the right to finish their set before yielding. Age shouldn't influence that. The parents might be instilling a cultural value of respecting elders, which is a common practice in many societies. However, the author's argument is about fairness and equality, not disrespecting elders.\n\nThe author's disagreement was public during dinner, which might have caused tension in the family. The brother felt disrespected because the author challenged his parenting decisions in front of others. That's a social dynamic\u2014public disagreements can be hurtful, even if the content of the disagreement is valid.\n\nBut the actual issue is the author's stance on the matter. If the nephew was in the right for not moving when he wasn't finished, then the author isn't in the wrong for supporting him. The parents' reasoning based on age could be seen as discriminatory or outdated. So, the author's position is about right and wrong in the situation, not about personal conflict.\n\nHowever, the way the author expressed their disagreement might have been inappropriate. Arguing in front of others, especially the nephew's parents, could have been handled more privately. But the question is about being in the wrong regarding the situation, not the manner of the disagreement.\n\nIn terms of the actual behavior, the nephew's refusal to move until done is standard etiquette. People typically wait their turn, but unless there's an emergency or time limit, finishing a set is expected. The 30-year-old could have waited a few minutes. The parents' reasoning that the older person's workout is more important because of age is flawed. So, the author's support for the nephew is justified.\n\nThe brother's reaction about \"respect your elders\" is a traditional value, but it doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. It's more about conflicting values. The author isn't in the wrong for upholding the principle that everyone's workout is equally important regardless of age. The disagreement isn't about being rude but about differing perspectives on fairness and respect.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for siding with the nephew. The answer should be B.\n"
