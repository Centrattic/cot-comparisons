So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with his nephew during a family dinner. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old asked him. The nephew wasn't done, so he stayed. His parents and the author's girlfriend think he was in the wrong because he's younger and should have yielded to the older person. The author disagrees, thinking that age doesn't determine the importance of one's workout. The author then sides with his nephew, leading to conflict with his brother.\n\nSo the key points here are about the gym situation and the reasoning provided by both sides. The nephew was using the machine and wasn't done yet, so he had the right to continue. The parents' argument is based on the idea that respecting elders means giving way, but the author argues that both parties have equal rights to use the gym, regardless of age.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, when it comes to gym etiquette, generally, if someone is using a machine and hasn't finished, others should wait their turn. There's no strict rule that older people get priority. Respect for elders is a cultural norm, but in this context, the practical aspect of gym usage might override that. So the nephew's action was appropriate, and the author's support for him seems justified.\n\nHowever, the author had to consider the family dynamics. By disagreeing openly with his brother, he might have caused family tension. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The main issue is the nephew's situation, not the author's confrontation. The author's reasoning is sound, so he's not in the wrong for supporting his nephew. The answer should be B (No).\n"
