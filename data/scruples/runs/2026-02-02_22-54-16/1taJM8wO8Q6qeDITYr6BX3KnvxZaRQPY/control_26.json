So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement over gym etiquette between the nephew and an older man. The nephew was using a machine and refused to move when asked by someone else. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong, arguing that the older man's workout was more important due to age. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up clashing with their brother.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the author's stance. The core issue is whether age affects the legitimacy of gym equipment usage. Typically, gyms operate on a first-come, first-served basis. If someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn regardless of age. The idea that older people's workouts are more important isn't a standard rule in gyms. So the author's reasoning that age shouldn't determine priority seems valid.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The author is not the nephew's parent but chose to take his side publicly, which might have caused tension with their brother. However, the author's disagreement was with the parents' reasoning about age, which could be seen as flawed. The nephew's parents might feel disrespected, especially if the author publicly disagreed with them. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping since they aren't the parent, but their reasoning isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. The nephew was in the right for using the machine until done.\n2. The parents' argument about age being important is questionable.\n3. The author's disagreement was with a flawed rationale.\n4. The author's role in the family dynamic might have caused interpersonal issues, but not the situation itself.\n\nSo, while the author might have caused some family tension, their stance on the issue seems justified. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
