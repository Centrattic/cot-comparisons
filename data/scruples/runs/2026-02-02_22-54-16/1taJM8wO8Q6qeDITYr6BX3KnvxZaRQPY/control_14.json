So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old man. The nephew declined because he wasn't done, and the parents and girlfriend supported the man, saying the nephew was wrong because he's younger. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter in this scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong to support their nephew. The core issue is about whether the parents were justified in their reasoning. The nephew was using a machine and had the right to continue until he was done. The man asking him to move might have been impatient, but that doesn't mean the nephew was in the wrong. The parents' argument that younger people's workouts are less important because of age seems flawed. The author's stance is that both individuals have equal importance in their workout, regardless of age, which is a valid point about fairness and respect.\n\nThen, the brother was upset, claiming the author was wrong because they should \"respect your elders.\" But the author isn't the nephew's father; they were defending their nephew's right to use the machine. The author's disagreement was likely about the principle of fairness rather than a personal attack. The brother's reaction might stem from defensiveness or a different view on how to handle such situations, but the author's position isn't inherently disrespectful just for disagreeing. \n\nThe key factors here are the right to use equipment without being forced to yield based on age and the appropriateness of the author's response. The author's argument that age doesn't determine the importance of one's workout is logical. However, the way they sided with the nephew might have caused family tension. But the question is about being in the wrong, not necessarily about causing tension. The parents' reasoning was based on an irrelevant factor (age), so the author's disagreement is justified. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting their nephew and challenging the parents' biased reasoning. The answer should be B.\n"
