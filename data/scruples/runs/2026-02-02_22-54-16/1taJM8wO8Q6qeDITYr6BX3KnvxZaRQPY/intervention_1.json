So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about the author defending their nephew's decision not to move on a gym machine when an older man asked. The nephew was using it, and he didn't want to stop early. The parents and the author's girlfriend sided with the parents, arguing that the nephew was wrong because he's younger. The author disagrees, thinking the nephew was right.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the nephew was in the wrong. Gym etiquette is usually about taking turns, but if someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. The nephew was using it and hadn't finished, so the 30-year-old should have waited. The parents argued that the nephew was younger, so his workout wasn't as important. But age shouldn't dictate priority in a gym. The author is standing up for their nephew, which is understandable.\n\nNow, the author's actions: they publicly disagreed with their brother and his wife during dinner. The brother felt disrespected, which is a family conflict. The author isn't the parent, so they might have overstepped, but the argument is about righting a perceived wrong. The author's intent was to support their nephew, which is a valid stance. However, the way they did it might have caused family tension. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author had a valid reason to side with the nephew. Since the gym situation doesn't inherently favor the older person based on age, the author's reasoning is sound. However, the family dynamics and the method of confrontation might be a separate issue. The core of the problem is about the nephew's right to use the machine, not the age argument. So, the author's stance is justified, even if the confrontation caused rifts. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, so the answer is B.\n"
