So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a conflict over gym etiquette.\n\nThe nephew was using a machine and an older man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and girlfriend of the author thought the nephew was wrong because he was younger, implying the older man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine gym etiquette. \n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the nephew do something wrong? If the nephew was using the machine and hadn't finished, it's reasonable he wouldn't move. The parents' reasoning that age makes the older person's workout more important doesn't hold in most situations. Gym etiquette typically prioritizes who is currently using the equipment. \n\nThe author defended their nephew, which is their right. The brother criticized the author for not respecting elders. But the core issue is whether the nephew was wrong. If the nephew wasn't at fault, the parents' criticism is misplaced. The author's disagreement was based on a valid point about fairness and gym rules, not disrespect. \n\nHowever, the author is not the parent, so maybe they overstepped in a family matter. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's stance was correct in terms of the situation, even if the way it was handled might have caused tension. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
