So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement over gym etiquette between the nephew, his parents, the author, and the author's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the girlfriend agreed with the parents, saying the nephew was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine gym priority.\n\nSo, the main points here are about gym etiquette and respect for elders. The nephew was using the machine, so it's his turn until he's done. The man's request to move might be seen as impolite or inconsiderate. The nephew's parents and girlfriend argued that the nephew should yield because of age, but the author thinks age isn't a valid reason here.\n\nNow, considering social norms, usually, when someone is using equipment at the gym, others wait their turn. However, if someone is taking too long, it's common to politely ask them to move. The nephew didn't do that, so he might be at fault for not yielding. But the parents' reasoning based on age is questionable. Age doesn't inherently make someone's workout more important. The author's point is valid there.\n\nThe author's mistake might be stepping in and publicly disagreeing with the nephew's parents, which could have caused tension. However, the actual issue is the nephew's refusal to move, which might be the real problem here. The author's stance on the reasoning being flawed is correct because age shouldn't dictate gym use. But the author might be in the wrong for not focusing on the nephew's behavior and instead challenging the parents' judgment.\n\nSo, the author's side in the argument might be right in terms of the reasoning about age, but their approach of publicly disagreeing with their brother could be seen as disrespectful. However, the core issue is the nephew's actions. The author's support for the nephew's right to finish his workout is justified, but the way they expressed it might have been inappropriate. The answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for their public disagreement versus their reasoning. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering both aspects, the answer is B (No), because the author's reasoning is sound, and the public disagreement might be a separate issue from the correctness of their stance.\n"
