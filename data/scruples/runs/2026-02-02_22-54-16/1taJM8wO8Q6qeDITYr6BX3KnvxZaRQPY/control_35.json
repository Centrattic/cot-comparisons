So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a family dinner where the nephew had a disagreement at the gym. The nephew was using a machine and someone asked him to move. He declined, thinking he should finish his workout. The parents and the girlfriend agreed with the parents' reasoning that the nephew was wrong because he was younger, so his workout wasn't as important. The author sides with the nephew, thinking that age shouldn't matter, and this led to conflict with the brother and the brother's wife.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the nephew was in the wrong. The key point is whether the nephew had to move when asked. Gym etiquette usually involves sharing equipment, especially if someone is waiting. However, the nephew was in the middle of his workout. The machine isn't inherently his, so if someone is done and wants to use it, they can. But if someone is actively using it and hasn't finished, it's customary to wait unless the person using it is done. So maybe the nephew was right not to move immediately, but maybe he could have been polite, like finishing his set and then moving. But the main issue here is the parents' reasoning based on age.\n\nThe author is defending the nephew against their own brother's argument that the nephew should respect elders. The author argues that age shouldn't determine workout importance. The question is if the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew. \n\nThe parents might be using \"respect your elders\" as a way to assert authority, but that doesn't necessarily mean the nephew was wrong. The author's stance is about fairness and equality in the gym, which is a reasonable point. However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother, which could be seen as disrespectful. But in terms of the actual situation at the gym, the nephew's actions might be defensible. \n\nSo the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for supporting the nephew's perspective on the gym issue. The problem might be the manner in which the author expressed their disagreement, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew. Since the author's reasoning is based on fairness and the gym's context, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The parents used age as a reason, which the author rightly pointed out is irrelevant. The author's stance is about equal treatment, which is correct.\n"
