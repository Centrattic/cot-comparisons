So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a nephew who refused to move from a gym machine when an older man asked. The nephew's parents and girlfriend argue that he was wrong because he was younger, but the author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core of the conflict. The nephew was using a machine and didn't move when asked. His parents say it's because he's younger, so his workout is less important. The author sides with the nephew, thinking that age shouldn't determine priority at the gym. The nephew's actions might be seen as rude if he ignored a request to move, but maybe he had a right to finish his workout. \n\nIn a public gym setting, there's usually an unspoken etiquette that if someone is waiting, you should yield once you're done. However, the nephew wasn't done, so he had a right to continue. The parents' argument is about respecting elders, which is a cultural norm, but the author's point is that the purpose of the gym is health, which applies equally regardless of age. \n\nThe key question is whether the author was wrong for supporting the nephew. The author's stance is about fairness over age, which seems reasonable. However, the author is not the parent, so they might have overstepped in a family discussion, leading to tension with their brother. But in terms of the actual incident, supporting the nephew's right to use the machine until done isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether the author's disagreement was justified. Since the nephew wasn't at fault for not moving immediately and the parents' reasoning was flawed, the author is in the right. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
