So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about the gym incident.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and girlfriend agreed the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, arguing that age shouldn't determine who moves. The brother later criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness, respect for elders, and family dynamics. The author's stance is that the nephew did nothing wrong and that age shouldn't matter in that context. The brother's reasoning centers on the idea that older people's needs take precedence, which the author finds flawed.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The author isn't the parent and is intervening in a family discussion. However, their reasoning seems logical\u2014the nephew was using the machine and had no obligation to move until finished. The parents' argument based on age seems arbitrary. The author's disagreement might have caused family tension, but their stance is based on fairness. \n\nThe question is whether the author's support for the nephew was inappropriate. While the author might have overstepped by challenging their brother in front of the family, their core argument isn't wrong. The brother's \"respect your elders\" argument can be seen as using age to justify hierarchy without merit. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting their nephew's right to finish his workout. The issue is more about differing family values and communication. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
