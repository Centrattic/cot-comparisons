So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old man. The nephew refused, thinking he had the right to finish his workout. The parents and the author's girlfriend sided with the man, arguing that the nephew's age made his workout less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and now feels they disrespected their brother.\n\nFirst, the core issue is about respect in the gym. Gym etiquette often suggests that if someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. However, if someone is being asked to move, maybe they should consider the other person's needs. But the nephew was in the middle of his workout, so interrupting might not be fair. The parents' reasoning that the nephew was younger and thus his workout was less important is questionable because age doesn't inherently determine the value of someone's workout. The author's point that age shouldn't matter seems valid here.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics aspect. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in to support the nephew might have upset the parents. The brother felt disrespected, so the author's comment in front of him could have been awkward. However, the author's stance was based on a belief in fairness, not disrespect towards the brother. The key here is whether the author overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother. Since the author isn't the parent, there's a line about how involved they should be in another's child's discipline. But the author was defending a valid point, so maybe they weren't entirely wrong. However, the way they expressed it might have caused tension. The answer hinges on whether the author's disagreement was justified versus causing unnecessary conflict. Given the parents' flawed reasoning, the author's support for the nephew seems reasonable, so the answer is likely B.\n"
