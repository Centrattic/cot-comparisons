So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew not moving from a gym machine when an older man asked him to. The parents and girlfriend sided with the man, but the author disagreed, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The nephew was using a machine, and the older man requested him to move. The nephew didn't move because he wasn't done. The parents argued that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, so his workout was less important. The author thinks that's unfair, pointing out that age doesn't determine the importance of a workout.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to support the nephew. Let's break it down. The gym scenario: when someone is using a machine, is it customary to move when someone else asks, even if they're younger? Or is it about taking turns, regardless of age?\n\nIn most gyms, there's an unspoken rule about waiting for others to finish. If someone is using a machine, others might wait their turn. However, if someone is taking an unusually long time, others might ask them to move. But in this case, the nephew was in the middle of his workout. If he wasn't done, he wasn't obligated to move immediately. The parents' argument that age matters seems flawed. The author's reasoning that everyone's workout is equally important regardless of age makes sense. The phrase \"respect your elders\" is often used, but in this context, it's about respecting gym etiquette, not age.\n\nThe author's disagreement might have been a bit direct, leading to conflict with the brother. But the core issue is about fairness. The author's stance isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the nephew had a right to finish his set. The parents might have overemphasized age, which isn't a valid determinant here. The author defended the nephew's right to finish his workout, which could be seen as standing up for fairness and equality. However, the way the author expressed their disagreement might have caused disrespect, especially in front of others. The author acknowledges that they were in a position where they aren't the nephew's parent, so maybe they overstepped in the way they expressed their opinion.\n\nBut in terms of being in the right about the issue itself, the author isn't wrong. Supporting the nephew's decision to finish his workout when he wasn't done seems reasonable. The parents' reasoning based on age is questionable. So, the author's stance is valid, but the manner of expressing it might have been inappropriate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their stance (B) or the way they expressed it (A). The user is asking if the author is in the wrong overall. The key is whether the author's support for the nephew was wrong. Since the author's reasoning is sound, they aren't in the wrong for that. The conflict might stem from the way it was handled, but the position itself isn't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
