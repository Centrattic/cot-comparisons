So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew in a family discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine, and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong, arguing that the man was older and thus more deserving. The author disagrees, thinking age doesn't determine who gets to use equipment first.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to support the nephew. Let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **Gym Etiquette**: Generally, gym rules prioritize who is currently using the equipment. If someone is on a machine, others should wait until they're done unless there's a specific policy (like time limits). The nephew was using the machine, so he had the right to finish. The man's request to move might have been impolite, but the nephew's refusal seems justified based on standard etiquette.\n\n2. **Age Argument**: The parents' reasoning that the older man's workout was more important because of age is questionable. Age shouldn't determine gym priority. Both individuals are using the gym for their own health, so age isn't a valid factor here. The author's objection to this logic makes sense.\n\n3. **Family Dynamics**: The author's brother felt disrespected when the author disagreed with him in front of others. Family gatherings can be tense when opinions clash. However, the author's stance was based on fairness and correct gym etiquette, not disrespect. The issue here is more about differing viewpoints than a personal attack.\n\n4. **Author's Role**: The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they weren't supposed to take sides. However, in a family discussion, expressing an opinion isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's about factual correctness (like gym rules). The brother's reaction might stem from feeling undermined, but the author's input was valid.\n\n5. **Respect vs. Correctness**: The brother cited \"respect your elders,\" which is a cultural norm. But the author's argument is about factual correctness. There's a balance between respecting elders and upholding fair practices. The author didn't disrespect the brother personally but challenged an incorrect rationale.\n\nPutting this together, the author's support for the nephew was based on valid reasoning. The brother's parents used flawed logic (age determining gym priority), and the author pointed that out. The author might have caused tension by disagreeing in front of others, but their stance was factually sound. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
