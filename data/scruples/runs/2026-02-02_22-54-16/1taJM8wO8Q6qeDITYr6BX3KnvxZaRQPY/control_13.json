So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about the gym incident.\n\nFirst, the nephew was at the gym and someone older asked him to move from a machine. The nephew said he wasn't done and refused. The parents argued that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter in this situation.\n\nSo, the core issue is about whether the nephew was in the wrong. The parents' reasoning is based on respecting elders and the idea that the older person's workout is more important. The author argues that both have equal right to the machine regardless of age.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, when someone is using a gym machine, others typically wait their turn. However, if the person hasn't finished, they can't be forced to move just because someone else wants to use it. The key point here is that the nephew was still using the machine, so the older man's request might have been premature. The parents' argument is flawed because age doesn't inherently determine whose workout is more important. The author is correct in pointing out that both should be treated equally in terms of access to gym equipment.\n\nHowever, the author is not the parent, so interjecting in the parents' disciplinary approach could be seen as overstepping. The author might have disrespected their brother by challenging their parenting decisions in front of others, which could have caused family tension. The parents might feel their authority is undermined when a sibling side with their child in a correction.\n\nBut the main question is about the author's position on the incident, not their role in the family conflict. The author's reasoning is valid in terms of equality and gym etiquette. The parents' reasoning is based on an invalid premise (age determining importance). So, the author isn't in the wrong for agreeing with the nephew's right to finish his workout. However, the way they expressed this disagreement might have been inappropriate, but the question is about being in the wrong regarding the situation, not the method of expression.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for their stance on the incident itself.\n"
