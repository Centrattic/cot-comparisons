So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew not moving from a gym machine when an older man asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend agreed with the parents' reasoning that age should determine who moves. The author disagreed, thinking that age shouldn't matter here.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core of the conflict. The nephew was using the machine and didn't finish, so he had the right to stay until done. The parents argued that because the nephew is younger, the older person's workout was more important. The author supported the nephew, which led to conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the parents' reasoning seems flawed. Age shouldn't dictate gym etiquette. The basic rule is that if someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. The nephew was in the right for finishing his set. The author's support was reasonable. However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother, the nephew's father. But the issue isn't the author's disagreement but the justification based on age. The author's argument is valid, but the social dynamics might make their approach problematic. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not the social consequences. Since the author's reasoning is sound, they're not in the wrong for supporting the nephew. So the answer is B.\n"
