So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves a family dinner where the nephew had a disagreement at the gym with a man. The nephew was using a machine and refused to move when asked by the man. The parents and girlfriend of the author agreed with the parents, saying the nephew was wrong because he was younger. The author sided with the nephew, arguing that age shouldn't determine who has priority at the gym.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the nephew was in the wrong. Generally, when someone is using a gym machine, especially in a public setting, others should wait their turn. However, the nephew was in the middle of his workout. If the machine is in use, it's common courtesy to wait. But if the man approached and asked to use it, the nephew could be expected to finish his set and then move, not immediately. However, the nephew's parents are saying he was wrong because he was younger. That reasoning seems flawed because age doesn't typically dictate gym etiquette. The author's argument that both were there to work out and should be equal is logical.\n\nThe author then took a stance in front of the brother, which led to conflict. The question is if the author was wrong for siding with the nephew. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they might not have the authority to judge. However, offering an opinion in a family discussion isn't inherently wrong. The brother's reaction about \"respect your elders\" is a traditional viewpoint, but the author's argument is based on fairness and equality, which is valid.\n\nThe key points are: the nephew's action might be considered inconsiderate, but the parents' reasoning is flawed. The author's disagreement is based on sound logic. The author's role in the conflict was to express a differing opinion, which is acceptable. The main issue is whether the author's stance was wrong. Since the author is not the parent and was voicing a valid point, they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
