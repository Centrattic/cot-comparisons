So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) who sided with their nephew during a family dinner is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement over gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using a machine and refused to move when an older man asked him. The nephew's parents and girlfriend argued that the nephew was wrong because the man was older, implying his workout was more important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author was wrong to support their nephew. Gym etiquette usually revolves around common courtesies, like yielding if someone has been waiting longer or if the machine has a time limit. However, in this case, the nephew was actively using the machine, and the man just asked him to move. The nephew wasn't done, so he had the right to finish. The parents' reasoning that age makes the man's workout more important is problematic because it's not a valid justification. Age doesn't inherently make someone's exercise time more valuable. \n\nThe author defended their nephew's right to finish his workout, which aligns with the principle of respecting someone's current use of equipment. The parents' stance seems to mix up respect for elders with gym rules. While respecting elders is a cultural norm, it doesn't override basic etiquette like waiting your turn unless there's a specific rule in place. The author's argument that age shouldn't determine priority makes sense here.\n\nHowever, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, which could cause family tension. But in terms of the actual issue\u2014whether the nephew was wrong\u2014the author's position seems valid. The key is whether the nephew did something wrong. If the gym didn't have rules about moving when asked, then the nephew was in the right. The parents' reasoning is flawed because they applied an arbitrary age-based hierarchy. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting their nephew. The main conflict is between respecting personal boundaries vs. age-based respect. The author's stance is more about fairness, while the parents used an irrelevant factor. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
