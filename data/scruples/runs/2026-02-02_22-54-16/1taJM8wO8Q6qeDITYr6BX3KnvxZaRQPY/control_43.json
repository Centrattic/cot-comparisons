So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a family dinner where the author sided with their nephew over his parents and the author's own brother.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The nephew was at the gym, using a machine, and a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew didn't move because he wasn't done. The parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagrees, thinking age doesn't matter in this context. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to side with the nephew. Let's consider the reasoning. The nephew was using a machine and had the right to finish before moving. The parents' argument is based on age, which the author finds invalid. The author's stance is that both people's workouts are equally important regardless of age. The brother is upset because the author is not respecting the elders (the nephew's parents) in front of them.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the nephew's actions were justified if he wasn't done. The parents' reasoning is flawed because age shouldn't dictate gym etiquette. The author's disagreement is valid. However, the author might have crossed a line by publicly disagreeing with the nephew's parents, which could be seen as disrespecting them. But the situation is about the nephew's right to use the equipment, not just about age. The author's support for the nephew is based on a principle of fairness.\n\nIn family dynamics, there's a balance between standing by a principle and respecting family hierarchy. The author didn't act out of malice but to support a right decision. The brother's reaction might be more about authority as a parent than the actual issue. So, the author might not be in the wrong for supporting the nephew, even if the delivery was perhaps not the best. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
