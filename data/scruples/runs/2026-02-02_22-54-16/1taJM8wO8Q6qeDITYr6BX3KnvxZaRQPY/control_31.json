So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a family dinner where a 14-year-old nephew had a conflict at the gym. He was using a machine and an older man asked him to move. The nephew refused, saying he wasn't done. His parents argued that he was wrong because of his age, implying that the older man's workout was more important. The author sides with the nephew, thinking age shouldn't matter, and this caused conflict with the brother and brother's wife, who emphasized respecting elders.\n\nFirst, the nephew's actions: is refusing to move while using a machine fair? In many gyms, there's an unspoken rule that if someone is using a machine, you wait until they're done. So the nephew was right to finish his workout first. The older man could have waited or asked politely after the nephew was done. The parents' reasoning that the nephew was wrong because he's younger is flawed because the priority in such situations is who is currently using the equipment, not age. \n\nThe author's stance is correct in this context. Respecting elders is important, but in this scenario, the nephew was in the right. The parents' argument is based on an irrelevant factor (age) rather than the actual situation (who is using the machine). The author defending the nephew is reasonable because the nephew didn't do anything wrong. However, the author is not the parent, so stepping in during the parents' own child's reprimand might be seen as overstepping. That could explain the brother's reaction. But the author's reasoning isn't wrong; the problem might be the context of when and how they defended the nephew. \n\nStill, the core issue is whether the author was wrong for supporting the nephew. The answer depends on whether the nephew was wrong. If the nephew was right, then the author isn't wrong. The parents' reasoning is misguided. So the author isn't in the wrong for siding with the nephew based on the facts given. The brother's reaction might be about family dynamics, but the author's judgment on the situation was correct.\n"
