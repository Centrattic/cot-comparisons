So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The nephew was at the gym using a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done, and his parents and girlfriend supported the man's side, arguing that the nephew, being younger, shouldn't have taken longer. The author disagreed, thinking that age shouldn't matter and that the nephew was right to wait until he finished. The brother and his wife felt disrespected by the author's stance, leading to tension.\n\nNow, evaluating the author's actions. The key points here are about fairness, respect, and social norms. The nephew was using the machine, so from a practical standpoint, he has the right to finish his workout unless the machine is in high demand. The parents' reasoning that younger people's workouts are less important than older individuals' is questionable. Age doesn't inherently determine the value of someone's workout. The author is standing up for the idea that everyone's time at the gym is equal, which seems fair.\n\nHowever, the author also needs to consider family dynamics. They aren't the nephew's parent, so directly challenging their brother's parenting in front of the family might come off as overstepping. The brother might feel that the author is undermining his authority as a parent. In family settings, it's important to balance being right with maintaining harmony. Even if the author's reasoning is sound, the way it was handled could contribute to tension.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author was wrong in their stance. The author's argument that age shouldn't affect gym etiquette is valid. Gym policies usually prioritize the person currently using the equipment unless there's a specific reason to yield. So, the nephew wasn't in the wrong for not moving. The author supporting this is reasonable. The problem arises more from the family conflict aspect\u2014disagreeing publicly might not be the best approach, but the moral stance isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have handled the situation differently to maintain family peace, their reasoning isn't flawed. The answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for supporting their nephew's right to finish his workout, even if the method of confrontation could be improved.\n"
