So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation revolves around a disagreement over gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using a machine and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done, which makes sense. His parents and the author's girlfriend sided with the man, arguing that the nephew was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter here.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n1. The nephew was using the machine, so he had the right to stay until he finished.\n2. The parents and girlfriend prioritized the older person's workout based on age, which the author found unfair.\n3. The author defended the nephew, leading to conflict with the brother.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning seems valid. In most gym settings, people are expected to use equipment until they're done, and age isn't typically a factor in determining who gets to use a machine. The parents' argument that the older man's workout is more important is flawed because both individuals have equal rights to the equipment. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they didn't overstep by defending their nephew's rights. However, they might have caused tension by challenging their brother in front of others, which could be seen as disrespectful depending on the context. But the core of the argument about fairness in gym etiquette seems on the author's side. So, the answer is probably B (the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
