So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with his nephew during a family dinner discussion. The main issue was about the nephew not moving off a gym machine when an older man asked him to.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using the machine and wasn't done, so logically, he had the right to stay until he finished. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend argued that the nephew was wrong because he was younger, implying that the older man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, pointing out that age shouldn't determine the importance of a workout. \n\nThe author defended his nephew, which the brother took as disrespect. The key here is whether the nephew's action was wrong. Since gym etiquette generally allows someone to finish their set unless there's a safety issue or time limit, the nephew's refusal to move immediately isn't unreasonable. The parents' reasoning based on age seems flawed because the value of a workout isn't contingent on age. \n\nThe author's stance is about fairness and not letting age dictate importance, which is valid. The brother's reaction (\"respect your elders\") is a traditional viewpoint but doesn't address the actual gym situation. The author isn't the nephew's father, so stepping in might be seen as overstepping, but the reasoning isn't wrong. \n\nSo, while the author might have caused tension by disagreeing with his brother, his argument holds merit. The answer would be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong about the issue itself.\n"
