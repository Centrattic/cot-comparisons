So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) was in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and girlfriend criticized him, arguing that as a younger person, his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, stating that age shouldn't determine the importance of a workout, and they sided with the nephew. This led to conflict with the brother, who brought up \"respect your elders.\"\n\nI need to determine if the author was wrong. Let's consider the key points. \n\n1. **Gym Etiquette**: Generally, when someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. However, if someone is still working out, they aren't obligated to move immediately. There's a common understanding that people should finish their set unless there's a reason to stop. So the nephew's action was reasonable.\n\n2. **Age and Importance**: The parents' argument was based on age, implying that elders' workouts matter more. The author countered that age doesn't affect the value of someone's workout. This seems fair because both parties have the same right to use the equipment.\n\n3. **Family Dynamics**: The author is not the nephew's parent, so they might not be responsible for enforcing rules. However, they supported the nephew's stance, which clashed with their brother's views. The brother's response about \"respect your elders\" is a common cultural value, but it's being used to justify a position that the author finds flawed.\n\n4. **Conflict Consequences**: The author feels bad for disrespecting their brother. But was the disagreement justified? The author's argument seems valid in terms of equal rights regardless of age. However, in a family setting, challenging parental authority could be seen as disrespectful, depending on cultural norms.\n\nSo, the author's stance was based on fairness and equal treatment, which is reasonable. However, the way they expressed their disagreement might have been seen as disrespectful in front of others, especially since they're not the nephew's parent. The core issue isn't about being wrong, but about differing values and how the disagreement was handled.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's reasoning isn't incorrect, but perhaps the manner of their response could have been more diplomatic. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for their stance. Since the reasoning is valid, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
