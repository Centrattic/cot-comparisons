So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they sided with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation is about the nephew not moving from a gym machine when an older man asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend agreed with the parents, saying the nephew was wrong because he was younger and the older man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, thinking age doesn't matter since both were using the gym for their own health.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the moral aspect here. The nephew was using a machine and didn't want to move until he was done. The parents' reasoning was based on age and respect for elders. The author is defending the nephew's right to finish his workout regardless of age. \n\nThe key points are: Did the nephew do something wrong? Is it fair to use age as a reason for who should get the machine? Is the author in the wrong for disagreeing with their brother and sister-in-law?\n\nIn terms of gym etiquette, generally, it's common to wait for someone to finish their set before asking them to move. But if the machine wasn't being used for an extended period, maybe the older man had a right to ask. However, the nephew's response was to decline, which might be seen as impolite but not necessarily wrong. The parents took it further by using age as a justification, implying the nephew's needs were less important. That's where the author is objecting.\n\nThe author's stance is that both have equal rights regardless of age. The brother criticized the author for not respecting the \"respect your elders\" thing. But the author is not the nephew's parent, so perhaps they shouldn't have to enforce discipline. However, in a family discussion, supporting a child's perspective is different from taking over as a parent. The author might be in a gray area here, but the main issue is the parents' reasoning. Using age to devalue the nephew's right to finish his workout seems unfair. The author's disagreement is valid in that context. They might have gone against their brother's authority, but if the reasoning was biased or incorrect, the author's side could be justified.\n\nSo, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They might have been right to support the nephew's right to use the machine as he was there and it's his time. The parents might be overstepping by making a moral judgment based on age. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
