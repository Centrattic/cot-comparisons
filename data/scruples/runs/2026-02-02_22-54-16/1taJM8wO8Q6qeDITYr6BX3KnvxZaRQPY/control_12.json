So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a conflict at the gym where the nephew refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to. The nephew's parents and girlfriend supported the man, arguing that the nephew, being younger, should yield. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context. Now, the brother is upset with the author for not respecting the parents' decision.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The main points are: the nephew was using a machine and refused to move when asked. His parents and girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout is less important. The author thinks that's wrong, as both parties have equal need for the gym equipment regardless of age. The author then took the nephew's side, leading to a conflict with the brother.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The nephew's right to use the machine until he's done is a key point. Generally, if someone is using equipment, others should wait their turn. However, if the machine is a shared one (like a treadmill or elliptical where multiple people can use different parts), maybe the situation is different. The description says \"machine,\" which could be ambiguous. But if it's a single-use machine, then the nephew was within his right to continue. The parents' reasoning that the older person's workout is more important is questionable. Age shouldn't determine priority in such situations. The author's disagreement makes sense here.\n\nThen there's the social dynamics. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they might not have the same authority. However, the author is part of the family and expressing an opinion doesn't necessarily make them wrong. The brother is upset because the author didn't back him up, which could be about family loyalty. But the author felt strongly about the issue. The question is whether siding with the nephew was wrong. Since the nephew was in a right (if he was using the machine) and the parents' reasoning was flawed, the author's stance might be justified. The brother's response about respecting elders is a cultural norm, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to question that logic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the nephew's parent, so they don't have the duty to enforce discipline. However, in a family setting, public disagreement can cause tension. The author's intention was based on fairness, not disrespect to the brother. So, the answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning was correct. Since age isn't a valid factor in gym equipment priority, the author's side is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
