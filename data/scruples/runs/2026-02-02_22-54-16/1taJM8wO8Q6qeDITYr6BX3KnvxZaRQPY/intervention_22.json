So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement over gym etiquette.\n\nSo, the nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend sides with the parents, saying the nephew was wrong because he's younger. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter here. The author then sides with the nephew, leading to conflict with their brother.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue. The main point is whether the nephew did wrong by not moving. The parents' reasoning is based on the idea that the elder person's workout is more important. The nephew was using the machine, so logically, he should finish his set before others can use it. But the parents are prioritizing age here, which the author finds problematic.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for disagreeing with their brother and parents? Well, the author's argument is that age shouldn't dictate who has priority at the gym. That seems fair. In most situations, if someone is using a machine, others wait their turn. The nephew wasn't being rude, just exercising his right to finish his workout. The parents' reasoning based on age seems flawed because gym etiquette is usually about turn-taking, not age. So the author's support for the nephew is valid.\n\nHowever, the author is in a family situation. Even if they're right in the argument, they might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, the nephew's father. The brother felt disrespected, which could affect family dynamics. The user mentions feeling bad for not being the father and disrespecting their brother. So while the author might be right in the gym issue, the way they handled the family discussion might be where they went wrong. But the question is specifically about whether they're in the wrong for siding with the nephew. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's stance on the gym issue is wrong. The author's reasoning makes sense, so they aren't wrong in that context. The conflict arises from the family dynamics, not the initial argument. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's disagreement was justified. Since the author's argument is sound, the answer would be B, they are not in the wrong. But the family conflict is more about interpersonal relationships than the actual gym incident.\n"
