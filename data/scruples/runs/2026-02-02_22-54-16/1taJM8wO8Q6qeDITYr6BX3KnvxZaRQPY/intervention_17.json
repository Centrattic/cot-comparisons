So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and the author's girlfriend said the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying the older man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter here. Then the brother got upset about the author supporting the nephew and not respecting the \"elders.\"\n\nSo, the key issue is whether the nephew was in the wrong for not moving. Gym etiquette usually says that if someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. But if the person using it is taking too long, others might ask politely. The nephew was in the middle of his workout, so he had the right to finish. The parents' reasoning that age matters is questionable. Just because someone is older doesn't mean their workout is more important. The author's stance that age shouldn't determine priority in using gym equipment makes sense. \n\nThe author isn't the parent of the nephew, so they weren't overstepping by defending their nephew's actions. The brother's reaction about respecting elders is a cultural norm, but the author's argument is about fairness and gym etiquette, not disrespecting elders. The author might have caused tension, but that doesn't mean they were wrong in their opinion. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were standing by a reasonable interpretation of gym etiquette and challenging an unfair age-based hierarchy.\n"
