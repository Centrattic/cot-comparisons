So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and got into a conflict with their brother.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's stance is wrong. The key points here are about respect for elders and fairness. The nephew's parents used the argument that the nephew was younger, hence his workout was less important. The author countered that both parties have equal right to the machine regardless of age.\n\nIn most gym etiquette guidelines, using equipment and taking turns is based on who is currently using it. If someone is in the middle of a workout, others should wait. Age doesn't determine priority in this context. The parents' reasoning seems flawed because it's not about age but about who is currently using the machine. The nephew was correct in not moving until done. The author supporting the nephew is just applying logical reasoning to the situation.\n\nThe brother's argument of \"respect your elders\" is a cultural norm, but in this specific scenario, it doesn't apply because the situation isn't about respect but about right of use. The author isn't disrespecting their brother by challenging that reasoning; they're pointing out a logical inconsistency. \n\nAlso, the author isn't the nephew's parent, so they shouldn't feel obligated to side with the parents on every issue. It's reasonable to support a family member when the parents' reasoning is questionable. The conflict arises more from differing views on applying norms rather than a clear wrongdoing by the author.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They stood by a fair interpretation of the situation, even if it led to a disagreement with family. The answer should be B.\n"
