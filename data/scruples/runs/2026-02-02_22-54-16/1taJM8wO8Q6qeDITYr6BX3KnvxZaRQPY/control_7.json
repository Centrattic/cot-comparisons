So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about a gym incident.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents and the girlfriend said the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, arguing that age shouldn't matter in this situation. After dinner, the brother (the nephew's father) confronted the author about it, leading to tension.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to support the nephew. Let's consider the key points. The nephew was on the machine first, so logically, he has the right to finish before moving. The parents' reasoning was based on age, which the author found illogical. The author isn't the parent, so stepping into the role of defending the nephew might be seen as overstepping, but the argument is about principle.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author's perspective makes sense. The gym etiquette usually follows a first-come, first-served basis. The man's request might have been rude, but the nephew was within his rights to finish. The parents and girlfriend's reasoning using age is questionable because workout importance isn't determined by age. So the author's disagreement is valid.\n\nHowever, the social aspect is important. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so taking a strong side in front of the family might have been disrespectful to the brother. The brother felt disrespected, which is a valid family dynamic issue. But the author's stance wasn't about the child's behavior but the unfair reasoning given by the parents and girlfriend.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's reasoning seems correct. The real issue is the parents' justification using age, which isn't a valid reason. The author supporting the nephew's correct action isn't in the wrong. The problem might be more about how it was handled rather than the stance itself. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
