So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for siding with his nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a nephew who was working out at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine that.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong to take the nephew's side. The key points here are about gym etiquette, respect for elders, and family dynamics. \n\nIn the gym scenario, if someone is using a machine, they generally have the right to finish their set before someone else uses it, regardless of age. The nephew was in the right by not giving up the machine immediately. The parents' reasoning that age matters here might be flawed. The author's argument that both individuals were equally entitled to their workout is logical. \n\nHowever, in family settings, especially when parents are involved, siding with a child can be seen as overstepping. The author isn't the nephew's father, so maybe the way he challenged the brother in front of the family could be seen as disrespectful. The brother's reaction about \"respect your elders\" might stem from wanting to maintain authority and family harmony.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is valid. The nephew's actions were justified, and the parents' stance was based on an invalid premise (age importance). The author's disagreement was based on fairness, which is a reasonable stance. While the author might have handled the disagreement better to avoid family tension, the core of the argument isn't wrong. So, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They stood up for fairness, even though the situation was uncomfortable.\n"
