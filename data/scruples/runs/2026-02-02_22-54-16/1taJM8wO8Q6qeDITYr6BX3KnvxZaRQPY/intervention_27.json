So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about the gym incident. \n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend agreed with the parents' view that the nephew was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context and that the nephew had the right to finish his set.\n\nThe author supported their nephew, which made them clash with their brother and his wife. Now, they're questioning if they're in the wrong for not supporting the parents' decision and for challenging their brother publicly.\n\nI need to consider a few angles here. From the nephew's perspective, he was using the machine and had the right to finish. It's a common gym etiquette rule that people should wait their turn unless the machine is being misused. The nephew didn't do anything wrong by staying until he was done. The 30-year-old person, while maybe wanting to use the machine, should have been patient. The parents' reasoning that age makes the older person's workout more important seems flawed. Age doesn't inherently make someone's needs more valid in a public space. The author's argument that age shouldn't determine gym etiquette makes sense here. \n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in could be seen as overstepping. However, supporting a younger family member in standing up for themselves might be a positive thing, especially if the parents are being unfair. The author's disagreement with the parents could strain family relationships, but the reasoning behind it is about fairness. \n\nThe author's brother criticized them for not respecting elders, which is a cultural norm in many societies. But respectfully disagreeing with a parent doesn't necessarily mean disrespect. The key is whether the author's intervention was respectful. Since the author was expressing their opinion and didn't attack their brother personally, maybe it's justified. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author's stance seems reasonable. The parents' reasoning is based on an invalid premise (age determining importance), and the nephew had the right to finish his workout. The author isn't in the wrong for advocating for fairness, even if it caused a conflict. The answer would be B.\n"
