So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for supporting their nephew during a family dinner discussion about the gym. The situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a machine by a 30-year-old man. The nephew refused, and the parents (the brother and sister-in-law) and the girlfriend agreed that the nephew was wrong, citing that he's younger and thus his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking that age shouldn't determine workout priority.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue: whether the nephew was in the wrong for not moving. Gyms often have etiquette where if someone is waiting to use a machine, it's considerate to let them know when you're done. But if the man just approached and asked him to move without considering that the nephew was in the middle of his workout, that might be inconsiderate. The nephew's right to use the machine until he's finished is reasonable. The parents' argument that age makes the older man's workout more important is a bit silly; age doesn't inherently make one person's need to use equipment more valid than another's. The author siding with the nephew here is standing up for the idea that everyone should be treated equally in such situations, which is fair.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics part. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother. However, if the author felt strongly that the parents were being unfair, their intervention could be seen as trying to support the nephew. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful. If they argued respectfully, maybe not in the wrong. But if they were dismissive or disrespectful towards their brother, that could be a problem. The user mentions the brother started talking \"shit\" to the author, so maybe the author's approach was too confrontational. Still, the content of their argument (saying age doesn't matter in this context) is valid.\n\nThe author's reasoning is sound. Age shouldn't dictate gym etiquette in this scenario. The real issue might be the way the author expressed their disagreement rather than the stance itself. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author's belief that the nephew was right is based on a fair principle, I think they're not in the wrong. The parents might have been the ones being unreasonable. The answer is B.\n"
