So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The main issue is about who should move on a gym machine. The nephew was using the machine, and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew declined, and his parents (the author's brother and sister-in-law) said the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout is less important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up arguing with their brother.\n\nFirst, the core of the conflict is about gym etiquette. When someone is using a machine, generally, you wait your turn. If you're done, you move on. But the nephew wasn't done. So the 30-year-old man asked him to move, and the nephew refused. The parents' reasoning was that the younger person should yield to the older, which the author finds flawed. \n\nIs the nephew in the wrong? Well, if the machine is shared, and the man asked to move, but the nephew wasn't done. It could be a matter of gym rules versus common courtesy. Some gyms have a first-come, first-served policy. If the nephew was using the machine and hadn't finished, the man might need to wait. However, if the machine is multi-station or can be shared, maybe the nephew could do part of his workout while the man waits. But the problem here is the man asked him to move, and the nephew didn't. The parents' argument that age matters is questionable. The author is right in pointing out that age doesn't inherently make one's workout more important. \n\nThe author's role is tricky. They are not the nephew's parent, so they might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother and sister-in-law. However, the argument over the nephew's actions being wrong based on age is a valid point. The author's disagreement is about right and wrong, not just taking sides for the sake of it. The brother's response about \"respect your elders\" is a cultural norm, but the author's stance is on the principle of fairness. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author's intentions were to correct a flawed reasoning (age determining importance), then maybe not. But in the context of family dynamics, they might have caused a rift by publicly disagreeing. However, the question is about being in the wrong in terms of the situation, not the family conflict. The author's belief that the nephew was right is justified, so they aren't in the wrong for that. The brother's disapproval is about family respect, but the author isn't necessarily wrong in their argument. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
