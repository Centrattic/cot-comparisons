So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The key points here are the gym incident and the subsequent family dynamics.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using a gym machine and was asked to move by a 30-year-old man. The nephew refused because he wasn't done, which his parents criticized, arguing that as the younger person, his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't determine gym etiquette, and supported the nephew. This led to tension with the brother and his wife.\n\nThe author's stance is based on the principle that everyone's need to use the equipment is equal regardless of age. The parents used the \"respect your elders\" argument, which the author found flawed. The author's girlfriend also sided with the parents, adding to the conflict.\n\nNow, considering right or wrong: The core issue is whether supporting the nephew was appropriate. The nephew was in his right to finish using the machine before moving. The parents' reasoning that younger people should yield to older ones is ethically questionable because age alone shouldn't dictate gym etiquette. The author's support for the nephew is justified here. However, the author's public disagreement with their brother might have caused family tension, which could be seen as a social misstep, but not necessarily being \"in the wrong.\"\n\nThe parents' argument is based on a subjective cultural norm rather than objective fairness. The author's support for the nephew upholds the idea of equal treatment, which is the fair stance. Even though the author isn't the parent, offering an opinion in a family discussion isn't inherently wrong. The brother's reaction seems to stem from defending his parenting approach, but the author's position is logically sound.\n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong. They supported a fair perspective, even if it caused family conflict.\n"
