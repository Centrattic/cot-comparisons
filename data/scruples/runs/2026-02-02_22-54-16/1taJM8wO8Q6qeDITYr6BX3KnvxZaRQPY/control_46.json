So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion.\n\nThe situation is about the nephew not moving from a gym machine when asked by a 30-year-old. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend think he was wrong because the other person is older, implying the elder's time is more valuable. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter here.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the gym scenario. When someone is using a machine, it's generally acceptable to wait until they finish before taking their spot. The nephew was in the middle of his workout; moving would be rude unless he's done. So, the nephew's action seems reasonable.\n\nThe parents' reasoning is that the older person's workout is more important because of age. That's a problematic logic because age doesn't inherently determine the value of one's workout. The author is right to point out that both are equally valid in wanting to use the gym. \n\nThen, the author publicly disagreed with their brother and the brother's wife, which might have caused tension. The author feels they overstepped by not being the parent, but they were defending a valid point. Family dynamics can be tricky, but the moral of the story is about fairness and respect for everyone's time, regardless of age.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The key points are the rightness of their argument and the context of the disagreement. While family relationships matter, the author's stance is justified. The answer should be B.\n"
