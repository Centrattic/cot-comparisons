So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew not moving from a gym machine when an older man asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend think he was wrong because he's younger, but the author disagrees, saying age doesn't matter in this context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The nephew was using a machine and didn't move because he wasn't done. The other person asked him to move, but the nephew refused. The parents argued that the nephew should have yielded because the man was older, implying his workout is more important. The author thinks that's unfair, as both were equally entitled to use the machine. \n\nSo, the key issue is about respect for elders versus equal access to gym equipment. The author's stance is that the nephew did nothing wrong and he supported him, leading to conflict with his brother. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nIn terms of social norms, \"respect your elders\" is a common principle, but does that apply when someone is using a gym machine? If the nephew was still in the middle of his workout, it's reasonable to think he had a right to finish. The parents might be emphasizing respect over personal rights, but the author is challenging that view. \n\nThe author's role here is as an uncle, not a parent. So, should they have interjected in the nephew's defense? It's possible that the brother felt disrespected and the author's support might have been seen as undermining him. However, the author's argument is based on fairness and equality, which are valid points. \n\nGym etiquette usually involves allowing others to use the equipment if someone is waiting, but the scenario doesn't mention if the man was waiting or if the nephew was taking up the machine for an extended time. If the nephew was using it normally and the man just asked to move, the nephew might have a right to finish. The parents might have a different view on respect, but the author is standing by a more practical approach. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they publicly disagreed with their brother in a way that was disrespectful. But if they calmly explained their reasoning, it's less so. The main question is whether the nephew was actually in the wrong. If the nephew didn't do anything inappropriate (like ignoring the man's request out of arrogance), then the author's support is justified. \n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the nephew's refusal was respectful or dismissive. If the nephew was polite but firm in not moving until done, then the author's side is okay. If the nephew was rude, maybe the parents are right. But the story says the nephew \"declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done,\" which sounds reasonable. The parents' reasoning about age being a factor in workout importance is a bit odd, so the author's disagreement makes sense. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting their nephew's right to finish his workout. The parents' argument is based on age, which shouldn't dictate gym etiquette. The author's mistake might be the way they expressed their support, but the reasoning itself isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
