So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is during a family dinner, the nephew had an argument with another guy at the gym. The nephew was using a machine and someone asked him to move. He refused, and his parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong. The author disagreed because he thought the nephew had the right to finish his workout. Then the author's brother criticized him for siding with the nephew, saying \"respect your elders,\" leading the author to feel like he might have disrespected his brother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The nephew was using a gym machine, and a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew didn't move, and his parents argued that because he's younger, his workout was less important. The author thinks age shouldn't matter here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting his nephew.\n\nSo, legal and social norms come into play here. In most places, unless someone is using a machine for an unreasonable amount of time, they can continue until they're done. Gyms often have etiquette where you wait your turn, but if someone is actively using a machine, you can't just make them move. So the nephew was in his right to finish. The parents' reasoning is flawed because age shouldn't determine gym access. The author is standing by his nephew's correct action.\n\nHowever, the author is also part of a family dynamic. He might have overstepped by disagreeing with his brother in front of others. But the core issue is whether the nephew was wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for supporting the nephew's right to finish his workout. The brother's \"respect your elders\" argument is a common but not necessarily valid point here. The author's stance is reasonable because the situation isn't about respect but about gym etiquette and rights.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. His support for his nephew is justified based on the situation described.\n"
