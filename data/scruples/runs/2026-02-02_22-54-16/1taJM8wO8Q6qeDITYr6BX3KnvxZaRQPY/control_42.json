So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation involves the nephew refusing to move from a gym machine when an older man asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend sided with the parents, saying the nephew was wrong because he was younger. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and got into an argument with their brother.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was in the wrong. The key points here are about respect for elders and the gym etiquette. The nephew was using a machine and didn't move immediately. The parents argued that since the nephew was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the older man's. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't dictate importance.\n\nIn terms of gym etiquette, generally, if someone is using a machine and hasn't finished, they can finish their set before others take turns. So maybe the nephew was in the right. The parents' reasoning about age seems flawed because age doesn't necessarily determine who gets priority in a workout. The author's support for their nephew on this point makes sense. However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother in front of the family, which could be seen as disrespectful. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their stance.\n\nThe parents might believe in \"respect your elders\" as a value, so the author challenging that could be seen as conflicting with family norms. However, the author's argument is based on fairness and equality, which are also valid. The nephew's right to finish his workout isn't about age but about the situation. So the author is defending their nephew's actions correctly, but the way they did it might have been inconsiderate. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the method. The core issue is the correctness of the author's stance. Since the author's reasoning is sound, the answer would be B (No).\n"
