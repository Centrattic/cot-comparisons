So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym and refused to move when an older man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger. The author disagreed, thinking age doesn't determine workout importance. The brother then accused the author of being wrong and disrespected him.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author was in the wrong. Key points: The nephew was using a machine and wasn't done, so the older man's request might have been reasonable, but the nephew had every right to finish. The parents' reasoning was based on age, which the author rightly challenged. The author's defense of the nephew's right to use the machine as long as needed seems valid. However, the brother's reaction was about respect for elders, a cultural norm in many families. \n\nThe author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, which could be seen as disrespectful. But the core issue of the nephew's actions might be less about right or wrong and more about gym etiquette. The parents' reasoning is flawed since age shouldn't dictate exercise priority. The author's stance that both parties have equal rights to the machine makes sense. \n\nSo, the author's disagreement with the parents' reasoning is justifiable, but their public confrontation might have been inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew. The answer likely hinges on the reasoning rather than the public disagreement. Since the nephew was in the right to finish his workout, the author supporting him is correct. The brother's emphasis on \"respect your elders\" is a social norm, but not necessarily a legal or ethical rule. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting their nephew's correct action.\n"
