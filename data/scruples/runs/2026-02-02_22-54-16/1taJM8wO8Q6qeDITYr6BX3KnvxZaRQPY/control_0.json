So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family dinner where the nephew gets into a disagreement with his parents and the author's girlfriend about moving from a gym machine. The nephew refused to move when a 30-year-old asked him, and his parents said he was wrong because he's younger. The author sides with the nephew, thinking age shouldn't determine who moves. Then the brother and girlfriend support the parents' reasoning. The author feels they disrespected the brother by disagreeing in front of others.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue: whether siding with the nephew was wrong. The nephew was using a machine and didn't have to move until he was done. The parents argued that the older man's workout was more important because of age. The author disagrees, thinking both workouts are equally valid regardless of age. \n\nIn terms of gym etiquette, usually, people are expected to finish their set without being interrupted. So the nephew's action seems reasonable. The parents' reasoning about age being a factor might not be sound because age doesn't inherently make someone's workout more important. So the author's side seems to be on the right track here.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been the problem. They publicly disagree with their brother and in-laws, which could be seen as disrespectful, even if their point is valid. Family dynamics often require tact. By not staying neutral, the author might have caused conflict and upset the brother. The author admits they're not the nephew's parent, so maybe they overstepped by taking a strong stance in front of others.\n\nSo the question is: is the author wrong because of their public disagreement, or is the brother wrong in emphasizing respect for elders? The author's argument might be justified, but the way they expressed it might have been inappropriate. The brother's emphasis on \"respect your elders\" is a cultural norm in many families, but applying it here might not be fair since the situation was about gym etiquette, not respect per se. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they might have handled it differently. Maybe they could have agreed with the brother privately later or explained their point without creating a scene. Publicly challenging family members can be seen as disrespectful, hence the brother's upset. \n\nSo the author's stance on the issue itself might be correct, but their method of expressing it could be flawed. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether the wrongness lies in the stance taken or the manner of expression. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew, and not about the manner, but the situation includes the conflict arising from public disagreement, it's a bit nuanced. However, the main question is about siding, not the manner. Since the author's reasoning is sound, maybe they are not in the wrong for taking that side, but perhaps in the execution. However, the question is AITA, so in the context of the family dynamics and public disagreement, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong for supporting the nephew's correct position, even if the way they did it was perhaps inconsiderate. But the key here is whether the author was wrong in their support, not the manner. The parents' reasoning was flawed, so the author was right to side with the nephew. Thus, the answer is B (No).\n"
