So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion.\n\nSo, the situation is that the nephew was at the gym, using a machine. A 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew declined because he wasn't done. The parents and the girlfriend said he was wrong, arguing that since he's younger, his workout isn't as important as the man's. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context, and now their brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the nephew's actions. He was using a machine and didn't want to move because he wasn't done. That's reasonable; people usually want to finish their set. But when someone asks to switch, especially in a shared space like a gym, there's an unspoken etiquette of sharing equipment. The nephew's refusal might not be wrong, but the context is important. Did he use the machine for an excessive amount of time? If he was just finishing a normal workout session, maybe it's okay. But if he was blocking others for too long, that's different.\n\nThe parents' reasoning is based on \"respect your elders.\" The man is 30, which isn't that much older than the nephew, who is 14. However, the parents think the nephew should yield to the older person. But the author argues that age doesn't determine workout importance. That's a valid point. In most gyms, you're expected to share equipment regardless of age. Maybe the issue is more about respecting the man's request rather than his age. The parents might have conflated the two.\n\nThe author's actions: They strongly disagreed with the parents in front of them, defending the nephew. The brother is upset because the author isn't the nephew's parent and took their side. The author feels bad about disrespecting the brother. But is the author in the wrong? Well, the gym situation is a bit of a gray area. If the nephew was using the machine normally, he has a right to finish. The 30-year-old might not have had the right to demand he move. However, if the nephew was being rude or not sharing, then maybe. But the nephew just said he wasn't done. The parents' reasoning based on age is flawed because, in general, everyone's workout is equally important regardless of age. So the author's stance is justified.\n\nBut the author is not the nephew's parent, so publicly disagreeing with the brother and his wife in front of them might be seen as stepping into a parent's role. That could be where the tension comes from. However, in a family discussion, especially when parents are being unfair, it's reasonable to voice an opinion. The brother's reaction might be more about feeling disrespected than the author's actual right or wrong in the situation. The author isn't at fault for defending a correct point, even if it made the brother unhappy. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
