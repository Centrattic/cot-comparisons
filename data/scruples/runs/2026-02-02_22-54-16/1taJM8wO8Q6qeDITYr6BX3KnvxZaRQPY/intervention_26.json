So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nSo, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine priority at the gym. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nFirst, the core issue here is whether the nephew was wrong to not move. The parents' reasoning is based on age, which the author finds illogical. The author supports the nephew's right to use the machine until done, which seems fair. Gyms typically don't have strict rules about age determining access to equipment. People usually wait their turn, but once you're using a machine, you're supposed to finish before moving. So the nephew's action was reasonable.\n\nThe author's disagreement with the parents might have caused tension, but the reasoning is sound. The brother's criticism about \"respect your elders\" might be a cultural or family expectation, but the author's point about equality in gym use is valid. The problem isn't the author's stance on the gym issue but how they expressed it, possibly disrespecting their brother in front of others. However, the user feels bad about that, so there's some self-awareness.\n\nSo, the key points: The author's reasoning is correct, but the manner of expressing disagreement might have been disrespectful. However, the question is about being in the wrong in the situation. Since the author's position is justified and the issue is about a misunderstanding or differing views, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
