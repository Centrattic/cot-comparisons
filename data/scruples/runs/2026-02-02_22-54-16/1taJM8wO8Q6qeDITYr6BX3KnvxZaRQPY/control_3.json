So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation involves a 14-year-old nephew who refused to move from a gym machine when asked by a 30-year-old man. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend say the nephew was wrong because he's younger, but the author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The nephew was using a machine and didn't move when asked. The parents' reasoning is that the older man's workout is more important because of his age. The author thinks that's not fair, as both people are there to work out, regardless of age.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for supporting their nephew? Well, the nephew was using the machine, so he has the right to finish his workout. The older man asked him to move, but the nephew wasn't obligated to do so unless he was done. The parents' argument based on age seems a bit off. Age doesn't inherently make one person's need more important than another's in a public gym setting. The author is standing by the idea that the nephew didn't do anything wrong, which seems reasonable. The author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the nephew's father, but their reasoning is sound. So the author isn't in the wrong because the nephew was right not to move until he was done, and the parents' argument is flawed. The answer should be B.\n"
