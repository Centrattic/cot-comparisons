So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew refusing to move from a gym machine when an older man asked him to. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend argued that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't determine priority at the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue. At the gym, when equipment is shared, there's usually an unspoken etiquette. Typically, if someone is using a machine, others wait their turn. But if someone is done, they should move on. In this case, the nephew was using the machine and hadn't finished, so he wasn't obligated to move. The man who asked him to move might have assumed the nephew was done, but that's not clear. The nephew's refusal seems justified because he was still working out.\n\nThe parents' reasoning based on age is problematic. Age doesn't inherently make one person's workout more important than another's. The author's stance that the nephew was right to stay on the machine until done is logical. The author's conflict with the brother over \"respect your elders\" is a traditional view, but in this context, the situation isn't about respecting the man's age but about gym etiquette. The author's disagreement isn't disrespecting the brother but challenging the invalid reasoning based on age. \n\nThe author might feel they overstepped by not being the nephew's parent, but supporting a relative in a disagreement isn't inherently wrong. The key points are whether the nephew was in the wrong and if the author's support was justified. Since the nephew had a valid reason to stay, the author's support is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
