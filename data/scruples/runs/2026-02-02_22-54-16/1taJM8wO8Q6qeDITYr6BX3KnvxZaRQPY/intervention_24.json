So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a 14-year-old nephew who was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend believed the nephew was wrong because of his age, implying that the older man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, leading to a conflict with the brother who brought up \"respect your elders.\"\n\nI need to evaluate the reasonableness of each party's stance. The nephew was using the machine; he had the right to finish his workout unless the machine was needed immediately. The parents' argument that age determines importance of the workout isn't logically sound. Age might not correlate with the necessity or importance of using a gym equipment. The author supported the nephew's right to finish, which is a valid perspective. The brother's reaction seems to be about respecting authority (elders) rather than the actual situation. The author's disagreement was based on fairness, not disrespect towards the brother as a person. The key here is whether the author overstepped or not. Since it's a family discussion, the author's right to have an opinion isn't wrong. The brother's issue is more about tradition (\"respect your elders\") rather than the actual gym etiquette. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so they aren't taking over parental authority but are voicing a differing opinion. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
