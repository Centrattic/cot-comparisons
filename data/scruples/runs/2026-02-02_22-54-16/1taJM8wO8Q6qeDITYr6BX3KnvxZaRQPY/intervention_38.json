So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dinner where the nephew got into a conflict at the gym. The nephew was using a machine and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew said no because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he's younger, implying that the older man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and now his brother is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The nephew was using a machine, so he had a right to continue until he's done. The 30-year-old asked him to move, but the nephew was in the middle of his workout. The parents' reasoning is based on age, suggesting that the older person's time is more valuable. The author thinks this is wrong because both are there to work out, and age shouldn't determine that.\n\nIs it about respecting elders? The brother brought up \"respect your elders,\" but in a gym setting, the main issue is about shared equipment and etiquette. Typically, people are supposed to use the equipment they're on until they're done, unless there's a specific rule or time limit. There's no mention of the gym having a policy where younger people should yield to older ones. So the nephew's action of not moving when he wasn't done seems valid.\n\nThe author's disagreement with the nephew's parents is based on the principle that everyone's workout is equally important regardless of age. The brother's reaction is about family dynamics and respect. The author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with his brother in front of the family, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the core issue is whether the nephew was wrong. If the author is correct that the nephew did nothing wrong, then siding with him isn't in the wrong. The brother's argument about \"respect your elders\" is more about social norms than the actual situation's fairness.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the nephew had the right to finish his workout, age shouldn't matter in that context, so the author's support for him is justified. The brother's issue is more about authority and respect, but the author isn't wrong in the situation's actual merits. Therefore, the answer is B (No)."
