So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the original situation) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The nephew was at the gym and was told by a 30-year-old to move from a machine. The nephew refused, thinking he had the right to finish his workout. The parents and girlfriend sided with the idea that the nephew was wrong because he's younger, and the author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter here.\n\nThe key points here are about the situation at the gym and the reasoning given by the nephew's parents. The nephew was using a machine and someone asked him to move. The parents' reasoning was that the 30-year-old (an elder) should have priority because of age, while the author argues that age doesn't determine the importance of one's workout.\n\nLegally or ethically, when a gym machine is in use, the person using it has the right to finish their session. Most gyms have rules that if someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. So the nephew's refusal to move immediately when asked might be within his rights, depending on gym policies. However, in some cases, if the machine is a high-demand one and someone else is waiting, there might be an expectation to move after a certain time. But the nephew wasn't necessarily in the wrong for not moving immediately.\n\nThe parents' argument hinges on the age being a factor. The author correctly points out that age doesn't inherently make someone's workout more important. Both individuals have a right to use the gym equipment, and age shouldn't dictate who yields. The author's support for the nephew here is based on fairness and equal rights, regardless of age. \n\nThe author's decision to side with the nephew in a family discussion might have caused tension, especially with the brother challenging them. However, the author's reasoning is sound. By standing up for the nephew's correct reasoning, the author is promoting a fair and logical perspective. The criticism from the author's brother about respecting elders might be more about social norms rather than the actual rightness of the situation. \n\nIn terms of family dynamics, the author might feel conflicted because they're not the parent, but that doesn't mean their opinion is wrong. The main issue here is whether the nephew was in the wrong, and the author's support is based on valid reasoning. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for defending the nephew's stance against the parents' age-based argument.\n"
