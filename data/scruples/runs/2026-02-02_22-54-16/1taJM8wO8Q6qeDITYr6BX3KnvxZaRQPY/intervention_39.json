So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the scenario is a family dinner where the nephew (14 years old) was at the gym and another man (30) asked him to move from a machine. The nephew declined because he wasn't done. The parents and girlfriend said he was wrong, reasoning that since he's younger, his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, saying age doesn't matter in that context, leading to some conflict with the brother and his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The nephew was using a gym machine, someone older asked him to move, and he refused. The parents' stance is that younger people should yield to older ones, but the author thinks that's not fair. \n\nThe main issue is whether the nephew was wrong to not move. The parents and girlfriend think he was, because of the age argument. The author sides with the nephew, believing that everyone's workout is equally important regardless of age. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Siding with the nephew in a family dynamic can be tricky. Family elders might feel their authority is being challenged. But the question is about whether the nephew was in the wrong. \n\nIn real-life gym situations, when someone is using a machine, the common etiquette is to wait your turn unless the person is done. If the nephew was still using it, he wasn't obligated to move just because someone older asked. The parents' reasoning that the nephew's workout isn't as important because he's younger seems flawed. Importance of a workout isn't determined by age. The author's point is valid here.\n\nHowever, the author isn't the parent of the nephew. So, challenging the parents' authority in front of the family could be seen as overstepping. But that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong for the actual situation. The author's disagreement is with the parents' judgment of the nephew's actions, which can be a matter of opinion.\n\nThe core is about the situation's fairness, not the author's role in the family dispute. The nephew's right to use the machine isn't dependent on age. Therefore, the author supporting the nephew's decision is correct in that context. The family dynamics issue is separate. The main question is about the gym incident. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the nephew's actions were reasonable, and the parents' reasoning is invalid. The author's support for the nephew is based on a fair interpretation of the situation.\n"
