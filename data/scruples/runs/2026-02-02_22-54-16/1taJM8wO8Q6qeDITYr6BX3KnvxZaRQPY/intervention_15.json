So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family dinner where the nephew had a disagreement about gym etiquette. The nephew was using a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused, thinking he had the right to finish his workout. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying that younger people should yield to older ones. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up siding with the nephew. Then the brother (the nephew's father) was upset, and the author is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong for supporting their nephew. Let's consider the key points. The nephew was using the machine and hadn't finished his workout. The man asked him to move, but the nephew had the right to continue. Gym etiquette usually suggests that if someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. However, some gyms have time limits, but the post doesn't mention that. The parents' argument is based on age, which the author rightly points out is irrelevant. The author's stance seems based on fairness and equal rights regardless of age. \n\nThe brother's reaction is about respect for elders, which is a common family value, but the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with the brother. However, the author's argument is about a principle\u2014whether age justifies different treatment. The author isn't taking sides in parenting but is challenging the validity of the parents' reasoning. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key is whether the author's disagreement was justified. Since the author's reasoning makes sense (age shouldn't determine gym etiquette), they aren't wrong for supporting the nephew. However, the social context of the family dinner and the brother's feelings might make the situation more complex. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about social consequences. The author's stance on the principle is valid, so they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
