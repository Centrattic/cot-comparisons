So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is a family dinner where the nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger and thus his workout was less important. The author disagreed, saying age shouldn't matter, and the brother got upset because the author sided with the nephew.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the main points. The nephew was using a machine and wasn't done when the other person asked him to move. He said no. The parents and girlfriend thought the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying that the older man's workout is more important. The author thinks that's wrong reasoning and stood up for the nephew, leading to conflict with the brother.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the nephew was in the wrong. The parents' argument is based on age, which the author thinks is irrelevant. The author is being criticized for not respecting elders and stepping into a parent's role. \n\nLegally and ethically, in a public gym, if someone is using a machine, they have the right to finish their set. Gym etiquette usually dictates that you don't interrupt unless there's a clear reason, like someone waiting and you're done. The nephew wasn't done, so refusing to move isn't necessarily wrong. The parents' reasoning is flawed because age doesn't determine gym priority. \n\nThe author's stance seems valid. The problem arises from family dynamics. The author isn't the parent, so taking sides in front of the brother could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author's argument is based on fairness and correct reasoning. The brother's anger might stem from feeling disrespected, not necessarily because the author was wrong in their opinion.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong in terms of the argument's content, but there's a social blunder in how it was handled. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong regarding the situation, not the social conflict. Since the nephew's action was reasonable and the parents' reasoning is based on age which is irrelevant, the author's support for the nephew is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
