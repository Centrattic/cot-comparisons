So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner disagreement. The situation involves a 14-year-old nephew who was asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old man. The nephew refused, and the parents and girlfriend agreed with the man, arguing that the nephew was younger and thus his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter, and now the brother is upset, accusing the author of not respecting elders.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main conflict is about whether the nephew was wrong to not move. The parents' reasoning is based on age, but the author thinks that's invalid. So, is the author wrong for supporting the nephew?\n\nWell, in terms of gym etiquette, typically people are expected to use machines for a reasonable amount of time. If the nephew was using the machine and hadn't finished, he's not obligated to move immediately. However, sometimes gyms have rules about time limits, but the scenario doesn't mention that. The 30-year-old asked him to move, but the nephew was in the middle of his workout. The parents are saying the nephew was wrong because of his age, which the author thinks is wrong because age shouldn't determine the importance of a workout.\n\nThe author's stance seems reasonable. The nephew was on the machine, so unless there's a specific rule about time, he has the right to finish. The parents' argument based on age is flawed. The author is standing up for the nephew's right to complete his workout without being told to move just because someone else is older. \n\nBut the social aspect is that the author is not the nephew's parent, so maybe they overstepped by taking a side in the parents' discipline. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their opinion, not necessarily their role in the family dynamics. The key is whether the author's belief that the nephew was right is wrong. \n\nSince the author's reasoning is based on fairness and equality (age not determining workout importance), it's hard to say they're in the wrong. The brother's \"respect your elders\" argument is a social norm, but that doesn't necessarily make the nephew wrong. So the author isn't in the wrong for supporting the nephew. Answer B.\n"
