So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a family dinner where the nephew got into a conflict at the gym. The nephew was using a machine when a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking that age shouldn't matter here. Then the brother criticized the author for siding with the nephew.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were wrong. The main question is whether the nephew was in the wrong. The nephew was using the machine and didn't have to move unless the other person had been waiting longer. Gym etiquette usually suggests that if someone is already using a machine, they can finish their set before others take turns. The parents' reasoning that the nephew was younger and thus his workout was less important seems flawed. Age shouldn't dictate priority in using gym equipment. The author's support for his nephew was based on fairness and equal importance of their workouts, which makes sense. However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with his brother, which could be seen as disrespectful. But the core issue is about right and wrong in the gym situation. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so maybe he shouldn't have taken a strong stance, but his argument had merit. The brother's response about \"respect your elders\" is a traditional viewpoint but not necessarily the right one. So, the author's stance was correct in terms of the gym situation, but maybe he handled the family dynamics poorly. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for siding with his nephew. The answer would depend on whether the nephew was actually in the wrong. Since the nephew was using the machine and the other person wasn't waiting, the nephew was right to finish. So the author's support was justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
