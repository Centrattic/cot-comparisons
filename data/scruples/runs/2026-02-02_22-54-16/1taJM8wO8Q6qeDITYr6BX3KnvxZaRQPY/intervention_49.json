So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion. The situation involves a disagreement over who should have priority at the gym. The nephew, a 14-year-old, was using a machine and another man asked him to move. The nephew refused, and his parents and the author's girlfriend argued that he was wrong because he was younger and thus his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking that age shouldn't determine the importance of someone's workout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The nephew was using the machine, so logically, he should finish before moving. The man asking him to move could be seen as impolite if the nephew wasn't done. However, in a gym, there's usually an unspoken understanding of sharing equipment. But the nephew wasn't done, so the man shouldn't have asked him to move. The nephew's parents' reasoning that his workout was less important because he's younger seems flawed. The author is correct in pointing out that age doesn't dictate the importance of one's workout. \n\nThen, the social dynamics. The author is not the nephew's parent, so stepping in during dinner might have been seen as overstepping, especially if the brother felt disrespected. However, the author's disagreement was based on the validity of the reasoning, not on the nephew's actions. The brother's reaction might be more about the author challenging his authority rather than the actual issue. \n\nThe main question is whether siding with the nephew was wrong. The author's argument is logically sound. The nephew was in his right to finish his workout. The parents' reasoning is invalid. The author isn't in the wrong for supporting a correct point. However, the way the author expressed their disagreement might have caused tension. But the content of the argument isn't wrong. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
