So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement over whether the nephew was right to refuse moving from a gym machine when an older man asked. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend supported the parents, arguing that the nephew was wrong because he's younger and that the older man's workout was more important. The author disagrees, thinking that age shouldn't determine who gets to use the equipment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The nephew was using a machine and was asked to move. He refused because he wasn't done. The parents' reasoning is based on the idea that respecting elders is important, so the younger person should yield. The author thinks that's invalid because both people are working out and age doesn't make one's workout more important than the other.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the gym scenario usually follows an unspoken rule where if someone is using a machine, others should wait until they're done. There's no rule that says younger people must give way to older ones because of age. So the nephew's refusal isn't inherently wrong. The parents might be enforcing a value of respecting elders, which is a cultural norm in many societies, but that doesn't necessarily make their stance factually correct in a practical gym setting. The author's support for the nephew is based on the principle that everyone's workout is equally important regardless of age, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe author's brother criticized them for not respecting his authority as the nephew's father. However, the author isn't the nephew's parent, so they aren't obligated to follow the brother's lead in all situations. The author's disagreement might have been a matter of standing up for what they believe is right, even if it caused tension. While the author's approach might have been tactless in the moment, the reasoning isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo the question is whether the author was in the wrong for supporting the nephew's actions. The key factors are the validity of the parents' reasoning versus the author's. Since the parents based their argument on age as a determinant of importance, which isn't a justifiable reason in this context, the author's stance is more aligned with fairness. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for siding with the nephew.\n"
