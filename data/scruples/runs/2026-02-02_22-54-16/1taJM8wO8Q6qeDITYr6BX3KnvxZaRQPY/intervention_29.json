So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old man. The nephew refused because he wasn't done, and his parents and the author's girlfriend sided with the man, citing that the nephew was younger and thus his workout was less important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't determine who gets to use the equipment first.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and respect. The nephew was using the machine, so logically, he should finish before moving. The parents' argument is based on age, which the author rightly points out is irrelevant. The author stood by their nephew, which is supporting the nephew's right to finish his workout. However, the author then faced criticism from their brother for not respecting elders.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's stance is based on fairness and equality, which is reasonable. However, family dynamics can be tricky. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in during a parent's correction might have been perceived as overstepping, even if the reasoning was sound. The brother's reaction about \"respect your elders\" is a cultural or traditional view, but age shouldn't dictate who's right in this context. The author's disagreement was on the right grounds, but the way they expressed it might have caused tension. So while the author's reasoning is valid, the situation's social context might make them feel in the wrong due to family roles. But ethically, siding with fairness over ageism is justified.\n"
