So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when a 30-year-old asked. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger, implying age matters. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't dictate who gets the machine.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that both the nephew and the man are working out for their own health, so age shouldn't matter. The brother and others brought up \"respect your elders,\" but the author thinks that's not relevant here.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong. The key points are about fairness and respect. The nephew was using the machine, so he had the right to finish. The author supporting that seems reasonable. The brother's argument about age is a bit odd because in a gym, usually, the person currently using the equipment has the right to stay until done, regardless of age. So the author's stance seems valid.\n\nBut there's also the social aspect of respecting elders. However, in a public place like a gym, practical rules (using equipment when it's your turn) might override traditional respect norms. The author's disagreement is about fairness, not disrespecting the brother. The brother felt disrespected, but maybe because he wanted to uphold a traditional value. The author isn't necessarily wrong; they're standing by a logical point. The brother's reaction might be more about authority and tradition rather than the actual issue.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
