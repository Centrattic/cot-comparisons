So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with his nephew during a family dinner. The situation is about the nephew not moving from a gym machine when an older man asked him. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, but the author disagreed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the main points here. The author's argument is that the nephew didn't have to move since he was using the machine. The parents' reasoning was based on age, saying the older man's workout was more important. The author found that reasoning flawed. \n\nSo, the key issue is whether age should determine who gets to use a gym machine. The author is defending his nephew's right to finish his workout regardless of the other person's age. From a fairness standpoint, if the nephew was using the machine, he has the right to finish his set. The gym etiquette usually says to use machines as you need and not leave them unless you're done. So, the nephew wasn't wrong in staying until he was done. \n\nThe author's parents-in-law might be thinking in terms of respecting elders, which is a cultural norm in many families. But the author is challenging that norm by pointing out that age shouldn't factor into the importance of someone's workout. The author's stance seems reasonable because the situation is about gym etiquette rather than respect for elders. \n\nAlso, the author isn't the parent of the nephew, so stepping in might be sensitive. However, the author's disagreement is about a factual issue (gym rules) rather than the nephew's behavior. The parents are possibly enforcing a rule based on age, which isn't relevant here. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author made a mistake. The answer depends on whether the author's reasoning is valid. Since the author is correct that the nephew had the right to finish, the author isn't in the wrong. The real issue is the parents' incorrect reasoning based on age. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
