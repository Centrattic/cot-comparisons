So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a conflict between the nephew and a 30-year-old man at the gym. The nephew was using a machine and the man asked him to move, but the nephew said he wasn't done yet. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend thought the nephew was wrong because he's younger, implying that the man's workout was more important due to his age. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't determine who has to wait.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Gym etiquette usually involves sharing equipment, but there's no hard rule that younger people must give way to older ones. The key point is whether the nephew was being rude or impolite. If the man asked politely and the nephew refused, maybe the correct approach is to suggest taking turns. However, if the nephew was being asked to move when he wasn't done, it's a matter of mutual respect. \n\nThe nephew's parents used the \"respect your elders\" argument, which is a common cultural value. But the author argues that age shouldn't matter in this context. So, the author is challenging a traditional norm here. \n\nIs the author wrong for supporting the nephew? Well, the author isn't the parent, so stepping in might have been seen as overstepping, especially if the parents felt the author was undermining their authority. However, the author's reasoning that age isn't a valid factor in this situation seems valid. The parents' argument that the nephew was wrong because of his age seems flawed because both people are there to work out. The author's disagreement might have been a matter of opinion, not necessarily a wrong action. \n\nThe brother's reaction of talking to the author after dinner suggests that the brother felt disrespected. The author might have been in a tight spot because they agreed with the nephew in front of the parents, which could be seen as disrespect. But the content of the argument isn't wrong. The author's stance isn't about right or wrong in the situation but about differing values. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their opinion, but maybe in how they expressed it or the context of the family dynamic. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's support was justified. Since the author's reasoning is sound (age shouldn't dictate gym access) and the parents' reasoning is based on a traditional but not necessarily correct view, the author isn't in the wrong for their opinion. However, the way they sided with the nephew in front of the parents might have been tactless, but that's more about family dynamics than being in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B, No.\n"
