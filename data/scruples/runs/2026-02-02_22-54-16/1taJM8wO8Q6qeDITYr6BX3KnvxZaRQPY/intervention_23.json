So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner argument about gym etiquette. The situation involves the nephew being asked to move from a machine by a 30-year-old, and the nephew refusing. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend side with the parents, arguing that the nephew was wrong because of his age. The author, however, disagrees, thinking that age shouldn't dictate gym etiquette in this context.\n\nFirst, the key issue is whether the nephew did something wrong by not moving immediately when asked. In most gym settings, the general rule is that if someone is using a machine, others should wait their turn. However, if the person using the machine is done, they should yield. But if they're still working, it's okay to wait. The nephew was still using the machine, so he wasn't obligated to move. The parents' reasoning that the nephew should move because he's younger is questionable. Age doesn't inherently determine priority in gym usage. It's more about mutual respect and taking turns. The author is correct in pointing out that both parties have equal right to use the equipment when in use.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics aspect. The author is a close family member, not the parent, so stepping in during a discussion between parents and child could be seen as overstepping. However, if the parents' reasoning was based on an incorrect premise (age determining respect), then the author had a valid point to correct that. The brother's reaction about \"respect your elders\" might be more about authority than the actual situation. The author's disagreement was based on a factual misunderstanding by the parents, so siding with the nephew isn't wrong in terms of the logic presented. \n\nThe author might have handled it differently in terms of approach, like suggesting a compromise or offering to mediate, but their stance on the issue itself isn't in the wrong. The real fault lies with the parents' flawed reasoning. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
