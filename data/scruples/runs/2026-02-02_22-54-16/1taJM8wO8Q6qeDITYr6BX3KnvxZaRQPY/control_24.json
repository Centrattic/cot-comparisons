So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family dinner where the nephew had a disagreement with someone at the gym. The nephew was using a machine and another man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done yet. The parents and the author's girlfriend supported the man's request, saying that the nephew was wrong because he was younger and his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking that age shouldn't determine who gets to use the equipment first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In a gym setting, it's common for people to take turns with machines. If someone is using a machine, it's generally expected that they finish their set before others take their turn. But in this case, the nephew was still working out, and the other man asked him to move. The nephew declined. The parents' reasoning was based on age, which the author finds unfair. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, the key points are about respect for elders and the rules of using gym equipment. The parents might be teaching their children to respect older people's needs, but the author's point is that age doesn't make someone's workout more important. \n\nIn terms of etiquette at the gym, typically, if someone is on a machine, others wait their turn. If the nephew was in the middle of his set, moving would be unreasonable unless there was a specific rule about time limits. However, if the other man had been waiting a while, maybe there's a different perspective. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The author is siding with the nephew because he was following the gym's unspoken rules by not giving up the machine before finishing.\n\nThe parents might be trying to enforce respect for elders, but the author is standing up for his nephew's right to finish his workout. The author isn't the parent, so he might be overstepping in the family dynamics. However, the parents' reasoning (age determines importance) is questionable. The author's disagreement is about the validity of the parents' argument, not just their right to parent.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong for supporting his nephew. The parents could argue that their authority as parents was undermined. But the author's stance is about the fairness of the situation. If the author's reasoning is correct, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he's interfering in a family matter where he isn't the parent, that could be a point against him.\n\nBut the main issue is the logic behind the parents' argument. If the author is correct that age shouldn't matter, then he's right to challenge that. The problem is the parents' reasoning, not necessarily the author's support for his nephew. The author's wrong would be if he's being disrespectful, but he's disagreeing with the parents' reasoning, not their authority per se. \n\nIn family dynamics, it's possible that the author overstepped by publicly disagreeing with his brother. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for siding with the nephew. If the nephew was right in the situation, then the author isn't wrong. If the nephew was wrong, then the author might be. But based on typical gym etiquette, the nephew was correct to finish his set before moving. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting the right action.\n"
