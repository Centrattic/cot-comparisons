So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement between the nephew and an older man at the gym. The nephew was using a machine and didn't move when asked, and his parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he's younger. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't matter, and ended up supporting the nephew, which led to tension with the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main issue here. The nephew was using a gym machine when someone asked him to move. He didn't move, and his parents argued that he was wrong because he's younger. The author thinks the nephew was right because using the machine is equal regardless of age.\n\nSo, the core question is whether the author was wrong in supporting the nephew. Let's break down the factors. In a public gym setting, there are usually unspoken rules. If someone is using a machine, others might wait their turn. However, the nephew wasn't done, so he had a right to continue. The parents' reasoning that the nephew should move because the other person is older seems flawed. Age typically isn't a factor in gym etiquette; it's more about who is currently using the equipment.\n\nBut family dynamics come into play. The author is not the nephew's parent, so stepping into the argument might be seen as overstepping. However, the author's reasoning about equal importance of workouts and not using age as a justification seems valid. The brother's reaction, invoking \"respect your elders,\" is traditional but not necessarily fair in this context. The author might have felt compelled to defend the nephew's right to finish his workout without judgment.\n\nThe key points are: the nephew's right to finish, the invalidity of age as a factor, and the author's role in the family. The author's support might have been justified, but the way it was handled could have caused tension. However, the initial stance of the author isn't wrong. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
