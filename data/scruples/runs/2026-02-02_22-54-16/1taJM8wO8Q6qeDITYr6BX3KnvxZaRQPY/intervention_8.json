So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a family dinner where the nephew was on a gym machine and another person asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done, but his parents and the author's girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger. The author sided with the nephew, thinking that age shouldn't matter in this context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. The nephew was using a machine, and someone else wanted to use it. The nephew wasn't done, so he didn't move. The parents argued that the nephew should yield because he's younger, implying that the older person's workout is more important. The author disagreed, thinking that the importance of the workout isn't determined by age.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for siding with his nephew? Well, in terms of fairness, if both people are there to work out, the person using the machine has the right to finish their set unless there's a specific rule about time limits. Age shouldn't dictate whose workout is more important. The parents' reasoning seems flawed because it's not about age but about who is currently using the machine. The author's argument is logical here.\n\nHowever, family dynamics matter. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in might be seen as overstepping. The brother felt disrespected, which could cause tension. But the author's intention was to support a fair point, not to disrespect his brother. The main issue is whether the author's stance was wrong. Since the author's reasoning is based on fairness and equality, not age, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The key is whether the author's support of his nephew was justified in the context of the situation. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
