So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a disagreement over gym etiquette between the nephew and a 30-year-old man.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using a gym machine when the older man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend argued that the nephew was wrong because he was younger and his workout wasn't as important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter here.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault. The main points are about respect for elders versus fairness. The nephew was in the middle of his workout, so not moving until he's done makes sense. The parents' argument that the older man's workout is more important because of age seems unfair. The author supported the nephew, which led to a conflict with their brother.\n\nThe author isn't the nephew's parent, so they might have overstepped by siding with him in front of the parents. However, the reasoning about age not determining importance is valid. The key is whether the author's disagreement was unjustified. Since the nephew was in the right to wait his turn unless asked politely, the author's support isn't wrong. The conflict arises from the parents' reasoning, which the author correctly challenged. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
