So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves a conflict between the nephew and another person at the gym.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using a machine when a 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. His parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because of his age, implying that the older man's workout was more important. The author disagreed, arguing that age shouldn't determine who gets to use the equipment first.\n\nHmm, the core issue here is whether age should affect who yields in such a situation. The author's stance is that both parties have equal right to the machine, regardless of age. The nephew was using it, so he doesn't have to move unless he's done. The parents' reasoning that the older person's workout is more important because of age seems flawed. \n\nIn most public places, especially gyms, the common practice is that whoever is using the equipment has the right to finish before someone else takes over. Age isn't typically a factor in these scenarios. So the nephew's action of not moving immediately was appropriate. The author supporting this makes sense because they're upholding the principle that usage rights aren't determined by age.\n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they intervened in a way that was disrespectful to their brother. The brother felt disrespected, so the author's method of expressing their disagreement could have been problematic. The content of their argument is valid, but the manner might have caused family tension. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their stance. The actual wrongdoing here is more about the brother's parents and the other person's entitlement based on age. The author's argument is reasonable. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong for their stance, even if their approach might have been tactically poor.\n"
