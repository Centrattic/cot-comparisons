So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The main conflict here is about a disagreement over gym etiquette and age.\n\nSo, the nephew was using a machine and a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done, and his parents and girlfriend thought he was wrong because he was younger. The author disagrees, thinking that age shouldn't matter in this context. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of each side. The nephew was using the machine, so logically, he has the right to finish his set. The man asked to move, but the nephew wasn't obligated to comply immediately unless there was a specific rule in place. The parents' reasoning is based on the idea that older people's workouts are more important simply because of age. That seems a bit illogical. The author's argument that both are equally valid in their right to use the equipment makes sense. \n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in during a disciplinary discussion might be seen as overstepping. However, the author is expressing their opinion, which is their right. The brother's reaction is based on \"respect your elders,\" which is a cultural norm, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong in their reasoning.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they didn't physically intervene or disrespect the brother directly. They voiced a differing opinion, which is acceptable in a discussion. The brother's response might be more about authority and family hierarchy than the actual rightness of the situation. The author's stance on age not affecting the importance of a workout is a valid point. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting their nephew's right to finish his workout. The brother's perspective is rooted in tradition, but the author's argument is logically sound. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
