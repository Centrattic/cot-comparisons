So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about the gym incident.\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done, but his parents and the author's girlfriend said he was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nThe core issue here is about fairness and respect. The nephew was in the middle of his workout, and the man wanted to use the machine. In most gym settings, the person currently using the equipment has the right to finish before others can use it. Age shouldn't determine who gets priority in that situation. The author's argument that both workouts are equally important and that age isn't a factor seems logical and fair.\n\nThe brother's reasoning that the nephew was wrong because he was younger doesn't hold water. The principle of \"respect your elders\" is about respect for maturity and experience, not about prioritizing their needs in a shared space. The author's stance supports fairness and equality, which are important values.\n\nHowever, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, which could be seen as disrespectful in the context of family dynamics. But the moral stance here is about right and wrong in the situation, not just about respect within the family.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting their nephew's correct action in the gym scenario. The brother's argument based on age is flawed. The author's disagreement was based on fairness, which is valid. So the answer should be B.\n"
