So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the post) is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The key points here are the gym incident and the reasoning provided by the nephew and his parents.\n\nFirst, the nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The parents side with the man, reasoning that the nephew was younger and thus his workout wasn't as important. The author disagrees, arguing that age shouldn't determine the priority of gym equipment use. \n\nSo, who's right in the gym scenario? Typically, gyms operate on a \"first come, first served\" basis. If the nephew was already using the machine, he has the right to finish before someone else uses it. The man's age shouldn't matter in this context. The parents' reasoning seems flawed because age doesn't equate to more importance in this situation. The author's support for the nephew is based on fairness and equality, which makes sense here.\n\nHowever, the author's brother took offense, bringing up \"respect your elders.\" In many cultures, respecting elders is important, but it's usually about showing courtesy, not about overriding someone's right to use equipment they're already on. The author might have been defending the nephew's right to finish his workout without being told otherwise, which is a valid point. \n\nBut the family dynamics here matter. The author isn't the nephew's parent, so stepping in during a parent's criticism could be seen as overstepping, even if well-intentioned. The author's brother felt disrespected, which complicates things. The conflict isn't just about the gym incident but also about family roles and boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's reasoning against age-based hierarchy is correct, but their intervention might have been inappropriate in the context of family dynamics. The parents have the authority to discipline their child, and the author's support could be seen as undermining that. However, the author's argument about fairness is valid. The answer hinges on balancing respect for family roles with standing up for fairness. Given that the author's reasoning is sound but their intervention might have been tactless, the answer is nuanced. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since their stance on the gym issue is correct and the parents' reasoning is flawed, the author isn't in the wrong for supporting the nephew. The main issue is the family conflict, not the moral rightness of the argument. So the answer is B (No).\n"
