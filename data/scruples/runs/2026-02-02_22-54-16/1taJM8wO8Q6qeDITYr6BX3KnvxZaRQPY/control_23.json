So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner argument. The main points are about the nephew refusing to move from a gym machine when asked by a 30-year-old, and the parents and girlfriend siding against the nephew. The author supports the nephew, arguing that age shouldn't determine who moves first, while the brother and in-laws disagree, emphasizing \"respect your elders.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue: the appropriateness of the nephew's action and the author's support. At the gym, when someone is using a machine, it's generally expected that they can finish their set before others use it. However, there might be unspoken rules about waiting if someone is done. The nephew didn't move when asked, which could be seen as polite or impolite depending on context. The author argues that the nephew was right because he was using the machine, and the man's age shouldn't matter. The parents think the nephew was wrong because he's younger, hence should yield.\n\nThe author's main mistake was publicly disagreeing with his brother and in-laws in front of their son. This could be seen as undermining the parents' authority, which might be important in a family setting. Even if the author's reasoning is sound, the way they expressed their disagreement could have been handled more diplomatically. The brother felt disrespected, which is a key factor. The author isn't the parent, so stepping into that role might have been inappropriate, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, while the author's stance on the issue might be valid, the manner in which they supported the nephew in front of the parents and the subsequent conflict makes them at least partially responsible for the tension. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
