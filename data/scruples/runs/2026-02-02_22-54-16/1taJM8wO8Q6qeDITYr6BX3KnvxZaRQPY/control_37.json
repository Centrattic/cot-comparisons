So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation is about a 14-year-old nephew who was asked to move from a gym machine by a 30-year-old man. The nephew refused because he wasn't done, and the author's brother and sister-in-law thought the nephew was wrong because he's younger. The author disagrees, thinking age doesn't determine workout importance.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the scenario. The nephew was using a gym machine and was asked to move by someone else. The nephew declined, which is reasonable if he's still working out. The parents argue that the nephew should have moved because the man is older, implying his workout is more important. The author supported the nephew, which led to tension with the brother and sister-in-law.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the nephew's actions were within his right. If he's using the machine and hasn't finished, he doesn't have to move. The parents' reasoning seems ageist. The author's support for the nephew is valid because the nephew was just following common gym etiquette (using it until done). However, the author might have overstepped by publicly disagreeing with their brother, which could be seen as disrespectful. But the core issue is whether the nephew was wrong. Since the 30-year-old approached the nephew, the nephew was justified in not moving immediately. The author's support wasn't about disrespecting elders but correcting a flawed argument. So the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
