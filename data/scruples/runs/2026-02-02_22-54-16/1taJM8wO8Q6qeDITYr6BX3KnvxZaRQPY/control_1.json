So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves family dynamics and differing opinions on how a gym conflict should be handled.\n\nFirst, the nephew was at the gym and refused to move from a machine when an older man asked. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend side with the parents' reasoning that the nephew was wrong because he's younger and thus his workout was less important. The author disagrees, thinking age shouldn't determine priority at the gym.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is refusing to move from a gym machine when someone else wants to use it a transgression? And does age play a role in that decision?\n\nGym etiquette usually suggests that if someone is waiting, it's polite to finish your set and then move, but there's no strict rule that age determines who should yield. The nephew was using the machine, so from a fairness standpoint, he has the right to finish. The parents' reasoning that age makes the man's workout more important seems flawed because both are using the gym for their own health, regardless of age. The author's support for the nephew is based on the principle that everyone's workout is equally valid, which seems logical.\n\nHowever, the author is a family member, not a parent, so stepping into a parent-child dynamic might be seen as overstepping. The brother felt disrespected, which adds a layer of family conflict. The author might be in the right in terms of the gym situation but in the wrong in terms of family boundaries.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's actions in siding with the nephew. If the author's judgment about the gym situation is correct, then they're not wrong for supporting their nephew. The problem might be more about how they expressed their support in front of family, leading to tension.\n\nSo, considering the gym scenario, the author's reasoning holds. The parents' argument is based on an arbitrary factor (age), which isn't a valid justification. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for disagreeing. However, the family dynamics complicate things. But the question is about the correctness of their stance in the situation, not the social fallout. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
