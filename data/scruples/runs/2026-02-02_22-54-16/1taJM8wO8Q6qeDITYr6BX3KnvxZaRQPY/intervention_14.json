So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner discussion about gym etiquette.\n\nFirst, the situation: The nephew was using a gym machine when a 30-year-old man asked him to move. The nephew refused because he wasn't done. The nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend argued that the nephew was wrong because he was younger, implying his workout was less important. The author disagreed, thinking age shouldn't matter in this context. The brother then criticized the author for not respecting elders.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and respect. The author is defending the idea that everyone's right to use the gym equipment when they're on it shouldn't be based on age. The parents used \"respect your elders\" as a reason, which is a common societal norm. However, the author's stance is that the situation is about equal rights to use equipment, not about hierarchy based on age.\n\nI need to determine if the author was wrong to side with the nephew. The nephew was using the machine, so he had the right to finish his workout. The man's request might be considered impolite if the nephew wasn't done. The parents' reasoning seems to conflate age with the importance of one's workout, which isn't logical. The author's support for the nephew is based on fairness, which is valid. However, the author might have overstepped by challenging the nephew's father in front of the family, which could be seen as disrespectful in some contexts. But the core issue about the gym etiquette is on the nephew's side. So the author's stance on the issue isn't wrong. The conflict arises more from the method of confrontation rather than the stance itself. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
