So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for siding with their nephew during a family dinner. The situation involves the nephew not moving from a gym machine when asked by someone older, and the nephew's parents and the author's girlfriend disagreeing with the nephew. The author sides with the nephew, leading to tension with the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The nephew was using a gym machine and refused to move when a 30-year-old asked him. The nephew's parents argued that because he's younger, his workout is less important than the older man's. The author thinks age shouldn't matter here.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking the nephew's side. Let's break it down.\n\nThe nephew was on the machine and wasn't done. The 30-year-old asked him to move. The nephew declined. In many gym etiquette scenarios, it's common for people to be polite and let others use the equipment when they're done. But the nephew wasn't done, so he had a right to finish. However, some might argue that showing respect to elders is important, even if it's a gym setting.\n\nThe nephew's parents are emphasizing the \"respect your elders\" aspect, which is a traditional value. The author is challenging that by saying age doesn't determine the importance of a workout. The author's position is based on equality in this context.\n\nIs the author wrong for disagreeing? Well, the author isn't the nephew's parent, so they shouldn't be expected to correct the parents' parenting. But the author's argument is about the fairness of the situation. If the author's intention was to support the nephew's right to finish his workout, that's reasonable. However, in a family setting, disagreeing with a sibling directly might be seen as disrespectful, especially if the sibling is the parent of the nephew.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The nephew's right to finish his workout vs. the gym etiquette of letting others go, 2) The parents' emphasis on respecting elders, and 3) The author's public disagreement with their brother and girlfriend.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they might be in the wrong if they prioritized the nephew's side over family harmony without considering the social dynamics. However, their reasoning about age not mattering is valid. The author's mistake might be in how they expressed their disagreement, not necessarily the content of their argument.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (No), because the author's reasoning is sound, but they might have handled the situation poorly by not considering the family hierarchy. Alternatively, could be A (Yes) if the author overstepped their role. But the question is about the author's wrongness, not the nephew's. The author's stance on age not determining workout importance is correct, but the conflict arises from the family dynamics. So the author isn't in the wrong for their belief, but maybe for the way they expressed it. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for siding with the nephew, so the answer is B (No).\n"
