She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl who has been happy with her transition but still experiences dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author's issue is that the friend keeps identifying as \"trans\" in every statement, like \"I'm a trans girl,\" and the author is confused about the necessity of that label.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is transgender and has been accepted by her community. The author is a cisgender person who doesn't understand why the label is important. The key here is to understand the significance of identity labels in the trans community.\n\nTransgender individuals often use the term \"trans\" to acknowledge their identity and the journey they've been through. Even if someone is happy with their gender identity, the term \"trans\" can be a crucial part of their self-identification. It might also be a way to connect with others in the community who share similar experiences. The author is suggesting that if the friend is a girl, then she doesn't need the label, but that's a misunderstanding. Being trans is about the gender one identifies with versus the sex assigned at birth, not about how \"feminine\" one feels. The friend's dysphoria and her statement that she doesn't feel like a girl enough could be personal struggles, but the label \"trans\" still applies because her gender identity differs from her assigned sex at birth.\n\nThe author's question is essentially invalidating the friend's need to self-identify as trans. Even if the author's intentions are to help the friend feel more like a girl, the approach is incorrect. The friend's use of the term is her right and part of her identity. By questioning it, the author might be dismissing her experiences and the importance of labels in her self-perception.\n\nMoreover, the friend's reaction was defensive, which makes sense given that her identity is being challenged. The author didn't approach the conversation with the right tools or understanding. It's possible the author is projecting their own confusion about labels onto the friend's situation, not recognizing that for trans people, these labels are meaningful and affirming.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that individuals have the right to define their own identity. The author's advice to stop using the term \"trans\" could be seen as transphobic, even if unintentionally. The answer here would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they are challenging an essential part of their friend's identity without understanding the reasons behind it. The friend's use of the term is valid regardless of how much she feels like a girl in daily life. The author's approach was not supportive and could have been hurtful, leading the friend to feel that her identity is being questioned.\n"
