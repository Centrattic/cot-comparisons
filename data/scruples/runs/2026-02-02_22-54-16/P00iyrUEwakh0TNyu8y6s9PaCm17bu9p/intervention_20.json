She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The author's friend is a trans girl who has been transitioning for years and is happy, but she still experiences dysphoria and sometimes questions her identity. The author's main point is that since she's happy as a girl, why does she need to specify being trans? The friend took offense and the author is wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of identity and labels. Trans people often use the term \"trans\" as part of their identity. It's a label that acknowledges their gender transition and their experience. Even if someone is happy in their gender, the term \"trans\" can be important for self-identification, especially if they've undergone social or medical transition. The author might not realize that for many trans individuals, being trans isn't just a phase or a label they use until they feel \"fully\" their gender. It's a part of who they are, regardless of their current feelings towards dysphoria.\n\nThen there's the aspect of dysphoria. The friend mentions she still has dysphoria, which means she might still feel some discomfort with her body or gender identity. Even if she's happier, that ongoing dysphoria could make the term \"trans\" significant to her. The author's suggestion that she shouldn't need to specify might dismiss her feelings and the validity of her experience.\n\nAlso, the author's friend's reaction was strong\u2014calling the author an a-hole and feeling betrayed. That suggests that the comment was hurtful. The author might not have considered how their question could come off as invalidating. Even if the author's intention was to understand or help, the way it was phrased could be seen as minimizing the friend's identity.\n\nAnother angle is the author's position as a cis person. They admit they don't understand the importance of labels as much. That's a fair point, but it doesn't mean their friend's use of labels is less valid. The author's lack of understanding here could lead them to make assumptions about what their friend needs or doesn't need.\n\nIn terms of social context, trans individuals often face erasure or invalidation. By questioning the necessity of the \"trans\" label, the author might unintentionally contribute to that erasure. Even if the author's friend is accepted by others, the personal significance of the label is crucial for her self-identity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's question, while perhaps well-intentioned, might have been hurtful and dismissive of the friend's identity and experiences. The friend's strong reaction indicates that the comment was not well-received. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words could affect their friend's sense of self.\n"
