She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is a trans girl who identifies as trans but has dysphoria and sometimes doesn't feel like a girl. The author points out that the friend includes \"trans\" in every statement and questions why she needs to specify it. The friend took offense and the author is confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend identifies as trans, which is her personal identity. Even if she experiences dysphoria or sometimes doesn't feel like a girl, her self-identification as trans is significant. The author's question might come across as invalidating because they're suggesting that if she's a girl, she shouldn't need to specify trans. This could imply that her trans identity isn't necessary or valid, which is a common issue in transphobic rhetoric.\n\nThe key point here is that labels are important for identity. Even if someone sometimes feels disconnected from their gender, their self-identification is what matters. The author's comment, though perhaps well-intentioned, might not consider the emotional weight and societal context that the term \"trans\" carries. It's possible that the author doesn't realize that for many trans people, using the term is about visibility, community, and reclaiming identity, not just about fitting a certain mold.\n\nAlso, the author's assumption that labels aren't important because they're a cis person might lead them to underestimate the significance of these terms. It's possible they're projecting their own views onto their friend, not considering that for trans individuals, these labels are crucial for self-expression and acceptance.\n\nThe friend's reaction is a clear indicator that the author's words hurt her. The author might not see it as an attack, but the question phrased in that way could be perceived as dismissive. Without understanding the nuances of why someone clings to their trans identity despite dysphoria, the author's statement could be seen as invalidating her experience.\n\nSo, in this case, the author is likely in the wrong because they questioned a core part of their friend's identity, leading to hurt feelings and a breakdown in communication. Even if their intention was to help or understand, the approach was problematic.\n"
