She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is a trans girl who has dealt with dysphoria and is happy with her transition. However, she sometimes says she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author brings up why she needs to specify \"trans girl\" instead of just \"girl.\" The friend gets upset, and the author is confused.\n\nNow, the key here is understanding the importance of identity labels for transgender people. Transgender people often identify as trans to acknowledge their lived experience of transitioning and their gender identity. For many, it's a crucial part of their identity. The author might not see the need for the label, thinking it's unnecessary. But for the friend, it's part of how she sees herself, especially given her history with dysphoria and transition.\n\nThe author's comment could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. Even if the friend is happy, the use of \"trans\" is a personal choice and part of her self-expression. The author's question might come off as dismissive of her experience. The friend's reaction is understandable because having her identity questioned can be hurtful, even if the author's intention was to help.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't mean to be harmful, bringing up the need to specify \"trans\" in that context might have been insensitive. The friend's identity is valid, and the author's intervention might have crossed a line. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
