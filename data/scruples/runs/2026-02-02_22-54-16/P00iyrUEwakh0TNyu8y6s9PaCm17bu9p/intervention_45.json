She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's been out for years and is happy, but she sometimes mentions not feeling fully like a girl and has dealt with dysphoria. The author noticed she insists on using \"trans\" in her identity, like \"I'm a trans girl,\" and questioned her about it, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's friend identifies as trans, which is part of her self-identity. Even if she's happy, the fact that she includes \"trans\" might be important for her self-expression or community. The author might not realize that the term \"trans\" can be significant for many people, even if they feel comfortable in their identity. The author's confusion might stem from not understanding the importance of labels, which is common for cis people.\n\nThe key issue here is the author assuming that because the friend is happy, the term \"trans\" is unnecessary. But trans individuals often use the term to acknowledge their journey and to connect with others in the trans community. The author's question might come off as invalidating her identity. The friend's reaction suggests that the term is important to her, even if she doesn't fully explain it. The author's intent was to understand, but their approach might have been dismissive or not sensitive to her need to self-identify as trans.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention wasn't malicious, but the action could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's use of \"trans\" is her choice, and the author's question might undermine her autonomy in self-identifying. So, even if the author meant well, the question crossed a line by challenging her self-identification. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A). But I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing, like if the author had a valid reason to question the use of the label. However, the friend's reaction shows that the term is important to her, so the author's question was out of line. Hence, the correct answer is A.\n"
