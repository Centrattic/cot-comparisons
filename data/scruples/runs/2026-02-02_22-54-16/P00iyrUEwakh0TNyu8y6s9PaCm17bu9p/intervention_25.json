She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is a transgender girl who's been dealing with dysphoria and uses \"trans\" in her identity. The author noticed that even though the friend is happy, she sometimes says \"I'm a trans girl\" instead of just \"a girl.\" The author questioned why she needed to specify \"trans,\" leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of transgender identity. For many trans people, the term \"trans\" is an important part of their identity. It acknowledges their transition and the gender they identify with. Even if someone is happy with their gender identity, the term \"trans\" can be significant for self-identification and community belonging. The author might not realize that the label isn't just about the transition process but about how the person sees themselves now.\n\nThe friend's reaction was strong, which suggests that the author's question was hurtful. The friend's use of \"trans\" might be a way to affirm her identity, especially if she still struggles with dysphoria. The author's question implies that being trans is unnecessary if she's a girl, which can invalidate her experience. It's possible the author is projecting their own cisgender perspective onto the situation, not understanding the complexity of trans identity.\n\nAlso, the friend's mention of not feeling \"enough like a girl\" indicates ongoing challenges with her identity. In such cases, the term \"trans\" might be a key part of her self-perception and resilience. By questioning her labeling herself as trans, the author might be undermining her self-identification and making her feel unsupported.\n\nSo, the author's intention might have been to question the necessity of the label, but the action of directly telling a friend to stop using it is problematic. It's important to respect how others choose to identify themselves, regardless of our understanding. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
