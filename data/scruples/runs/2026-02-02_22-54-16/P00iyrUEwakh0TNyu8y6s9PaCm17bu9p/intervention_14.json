She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is a trans girl who's happy with her identity but mentions dealing with dysphoria and not feeling like a girl enough. The author questions why she needs to specify being trans when she's a girl.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means to be transgender. The term \"trans\" is an identity label that people use to describe their gender, which is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. For many trans people, the label is important for self-identification and being recognized in society. Even if someone is happy with their gender identity, the term \"trans\" might be part of their identity and how they express their gender journey.\n\nThe author's friend uses \"trans\" in every statement. The author, as a cis person, might not grasp the significance of labels. But from the friend's perspective, using the term \"trans\" could be a way of affirming her identity, especially if she's still dealing with dysphoria. Even if she feels more comfortable now, the term might help her navigate her experiences and connect with the trans community for support.\n\nThe author's question implies that if she's a girl, why specify being trans. This could be dismissive of her identity. The friend's reaction was strong, indicating that the author's comment was hurtful. The author might not realize that for trans individuals, using the label is a matter of self-identity and validation. The author's suggestion that the label might be part of her problems could invalidate her experiences and feelings.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's important to respect how people identify themselves. Asking someone to stop using a label that's part of their identity, especially without understanding their reasons, can be seen as harmful. The author's approach might come from a place of confusion rather than malice, but the impact is still negative. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not respecting their friend's choice of identity labels.\n"
