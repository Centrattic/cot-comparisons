She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is transgender and has been happy with her decision, but mentions dealing with dysphoria and not feeling like a girl enough. The author questions why she needs to specify \"trans\" every time, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The friend identifies as a trans girl, which is her self-identification. The author is suggesting that maybe not specifying \"trans\" is better because she's a girl. The friend is upset, feeling that the author is invalidating her identity.\n\nTransgender individuals often use labels like \"trans\" to describe their identity because it's part of their self-conception and how they navigate the world. Even if someone doesn't \"feel enough like a girl,\" that's her own personal experience and doesn't negate her identity. The author's question might come from a place of confusion about labels, but the act of questioning her need for the term \"trans\" could be seen as dismissive of her identity.\n\nThe friend's reaction is intense, calling the author an a-hole. That might indicate that she felt her identity is being challenged. Even if the author meant well, bringing up such a sensitive topic in a direct way could be hurtful. The author might not realize that the term \"trans\" is important for her self-identity, regardless of the author's cis perspective.\n\nSo, the author is suggesting that the friend's use of the term \"trans\" might be complicating her issues. But trans people often find labels important for their identity and community. The author's advice could be seen as invalidating. Even if the author's intention was to be supportive, the way it was brought up might have been inappropriate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because they are questioning the friend's self-identified label, which is a core part of her identity.\n"
