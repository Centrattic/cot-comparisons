She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" thread is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl who identifies as trans, and she's been happy since transitioning. The author noticed that she often says \"trans girl\" instead of just \"girl,\" and the author is confused about the need to specify \"trans.\" The author brought this up, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend's identity is central to her self-expression. She's trans, and she chooses to include \"trans\" in her self-identification. The author, being cisgender, might not grasp why this label is necessary. But in the trans community, identifying as trans can be an important part of one's identity, even if someone might not fully understand it from a cis perspective.\n\nThe author's question is essentially challenging the friend's right to self-identify. By asking why she needs to specify \"trans,\" the author might be invalidating her identity. Even if the friend is happy, the way she presents her identity is her choice. The author's comment could come off as dismissive of the significance of labels in her experience.\n\nThe friend's reaction\u2014getting upset and saying it's not that simple\u2014suggests that this is a sensitive issue for her. The author might not realize that using the term \"trans\" is a way for her to acknowledge her gender journey and history. It's possible that the author's question, though coming from a place of confusion, inadvertently undermines the friend's identity.\n\nIn terms of social norms and understanding, it's generally considered respectful to let people identify themselves as they wish. The author's comment might be seen as intrusive or judgmental. Even if the author's intention wasn't to hurt, the impact on the friend was negative. The key here is respecting the friend's self-identification, regardless of the author's personal understanding or confusion.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
