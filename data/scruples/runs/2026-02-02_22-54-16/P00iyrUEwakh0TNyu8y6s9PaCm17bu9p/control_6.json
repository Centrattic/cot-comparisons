She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The situation is that the friend is a trans girl who has been struggling with dysphoria and keeps identifying as trans. The author, who is cis, thinks maybe the labels are causing the problem and brought it up, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been dealing with dysphoria, which is a significant issue. The author's friend is trans and has chosen to identify as such. From what I know, the trans community often emphasizes the importance of self-identification and labels as part of their identity and coping. So, when the author questions why she needs to specify \"trans\" if she's a girl, that might be seen as invalidating her identity.\n\nThe author's question seems to come from a lack of understanding about the role of labels in trans experiences. Even if the author is trying to help, the way they approached it was confrontational. The friend's reaction (\"I can't believe you would say that...\") suggests that the author's words were hurtful and not well-received. \n\nIn such cases, it's usually considered important to respect how individuals identify themselves. Telling someone to stop using a label they feel is part of their identity can be seen as dismissive. The author might not realize that for many trans people, the label \"trans\" is a key part of their self-conception and community belonging. \n\nAdditionally, the author's assumption that their cis experience can fully understand the importance of labels to a trans person is a common misunderstanding. It's important to listen rather than question someone's identity choices, especially when they're already dealing with internal struggles like dysphoria.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author likely overstepped by questioning their friend's self-identification, which is a core part of her identity. The friend's reaction indicates that the author was wrong in this situation. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
