She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender woman who's been transitioning and is happy, but sometimes expresses dissatisfaction with not feeling enough like a girl. The author brought up the friend's insistence on using the term \"trans,\" and the friend got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend identifies as trans and uses that label. The author, as a cis person, might not grasp the significance of the term \"trans.\" Using such labels is often important for identity and community. The author's comment could come off as dismissive or invalidating, even if they meant to help. The friend's reaction is understandable because identity terms are personal and can be sensitive. The author might not realize that the label \"trans\" isn't just about feeling a certain way but is part of her self-identification. So, even if the author's intention was to help, the approach might have been wrong. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
