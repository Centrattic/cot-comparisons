She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl who's been happy with her decision but has dealt with dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author brought up that their friend insists on using \"trans\" labels every time, like saying \"I'm a trans girl\" instead of just \"I'm a girl,\" and questioned why she needs to specify. The friend was upset, and the author is confused if they're at fault.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend identifies as a trans girl, which is her self-identity. The author's issue is that she uses \"trans\" in every statement, and he suggests maybe that's part of her problems. The author is cisgender, so they might not fully grasp why identity labels are important.\n\nIn trans communities, the term \"trans\" is often an important part of identity. It acknowledges the transition and the person's experience. Even if someone feels they don't \"feel enough\" like a girl, the label might still be significant for how they perceive themselves and how they want to be seen by others. The author's question could come off as invalidating because it's not about just the label but the entire journey and identity of the person.\n\nThe key here is that the author is questioning the necessity of the label, which might be dismissing the friend's self-identity. Even if the author's intention was to help or understand, the way it's phrased could be seen as minimizing the friend's experience. The friend's reaction suggests that the label is important to her, and the author's comment might have been triggering or hurtful, especially since the friend has struggled with dysphoria.\n\nSo, from a social justice perspective, it's about respecting someone's identity. Even if the author is confused, it's not their place to dictate how someone should identify. The wrong here lies in the author not respecting the friend's self-identification. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
