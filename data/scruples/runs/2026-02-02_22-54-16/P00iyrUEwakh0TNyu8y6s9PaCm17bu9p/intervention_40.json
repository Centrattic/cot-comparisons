She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is transgender and uses \"trans girl\" in her identity. The author, a cis person, questions why she needs to specify \"trans\" if she's a girl now. The friend got upset and said it's not that simple.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has gender dysphoria and sometimes feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author is suggesting that maybe using the label \"trans\" is part of the problem. But the author is cis, so their perspective might not account for the complexities of transgender identity.\n\nTrans people often include \"trans\" in their self-identification to assert their identity and to acknowledge their history. It's a way of claiming their place in the community and to educate others. For some, it's a political or personal statement about their journey. The author's question, while coming from a place of confusion, might come across as dismissive of the friend's lived experience and the significance of the term \"trans\" in her identity.\n\nEven if the author's intention was to help, the way they approached it was to question a core part of the friend's identity. That can be hurtful. The friend's reaction\u2014feeling betrayed\u2014suggests that the author crossed a line. The author might not have realized that the term \"trans\" is not just a label but a vital part of her identity and community.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they invalidated the friend's self-identification without understanding the context and importance of the term to her. The correct answer is A.\n"
