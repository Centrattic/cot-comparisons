She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user's friend is a trans girl (assigned male at birth) who's been out for several years and is happy. But she's had dysphoria and sometimes says she doesn't feel enough like a girl. The author feels that the friend overuses the term \"trans\" when identifying herself, like saying \"I'm a trans girl\" instead of just \"I'm a girl.\" The author asked why she needs to specify \"trans,\" which led to an argument where the friend was upset and defensive.\n\nHmm. The key here is understanding the importance of labels for transgender individuals. From what I know, the term \"trans\" is an important part of identity for many people in the LGBTQ+ community. It acknowledges their gender transition and can be a way of asserting their identity. Even if someone is happy with their current gender, the term might still be significant to them because it reflects their history and journey.\n\nThe author is a cis person, so maybe they don't grasp why the label matters. But the friend might be using \"trans\" to emphasize that she is transgender, which is a core part of her identity. The author's question could come off as dismissive or minimizing her experience. Even if the author meant it as a genuine question, it's possible that their lack of understanding led to invalidating her identity.\n\nAlso, the friend mentioned dealing with dysphoria and not feeling like a girl enough. In that context, the label might be a way for her to affirm her identity despite the ongoing dysphoria. The author's comment might have made her feel like her identity wasn't being recognized or respected.\n\nI think the author might have overstepped by questioning her use of the term. It's important to respect how others identify themselves, even if the reasons aren't fully understood. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they invalidated their friend's identity choice.\n"
