She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans woman who has been struggling with dysphoria and often emphasizes her identity as a trans girl. The author brought up the issue, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social and cultural context of gender identity. For many trans people, their identity is a significant part of who they are, and using terms like \"trans\" is a way to affirm their experience. Even if someone else might not see the need for the label, it's important for the individual's self-identity. The author's friend might use \"trans\" to highlight her journey and to be recognized for her identity, which the author might not fully understand.\n\nThe author's question, \"If you're a girl, why do you need to specify trans?\" could come across as dismissive. It's possible the author is making an assumption that being trans is something to move past or that the label isn't necessary. However, for many in the trans community, the label is empowering and necessary for their sense of self. The author's friend's reaction suggests that this was a sensitive topic for her, and the way the author approached it might have been seen as invalidating her identity.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of lived experience. The author is cisgender, so they may not grasp the complexities and societal challenges that trans people face. The friend might use the term \"trans\" to assert her identity in a world where trans people often have to reaffirm their gender to be recognized. The author's suggestion that the label might be a source of her problems could be perceived as blaming her for her dysphoria, which is a serious and personal issue.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author approached the topic directly, which might not have been the best approach. It's possible they didn't consider how their words could be received. Even if the author's intention was to support their friend, the method might have been hurtful. The friend's response indicates that the author crossed a line by questioning her self-identity.\n\nAdditionally, the trans community often emphasizes the importance of respecting how individuals choose to identify themselves. Advising someone to stop using a term that is central to their identity can be seen as an attack on their self-worth. The author's question might have unintentionally invalidated the friend's experience, leading to the strong reaction.\n\nSo, putting this all together, while the author might have had good intentions, their approach was likely hurtful and dismissive of the friend's identity. The author is probably in the wrong because they didn't respect their friend's choice to identify as trans, which is a core part of her being. The key issue here is the lack of understanding and respect for the trans experience, leading to a situation where the author's actions caused harm, even if unintentionally.\n"
