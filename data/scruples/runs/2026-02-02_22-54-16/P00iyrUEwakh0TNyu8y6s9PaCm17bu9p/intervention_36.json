She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The situation is a bit complex because it involves personal identity and terminology.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend is transgender, assigned male at birth, and has been living as a girl for years. She's happy but still experiences dysphoria and doesn't feel like a girl enough. The author is confused about why she insists on being called a \"trans girl\" instead of just a girl. The author questioned her about it, leading to an argument.\n\nThe author's main concern is that the friend's insistence on the label \"trans\" might be contributing to her issues. The author, as a cisgender person, doesn't see the necessity of the label. However, the friend took offense and felt disrespected.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of identity. For many transgender individuals, identifying as trans is a crucial part of their self-expression and a way to acknowledge their journey. The term \"trans\" can be empowering and a source of community. Dismissing that label, even with good intentions, can be seen as invalidating their identity. \n\nThe author's question comes from a place of confusion and possibly a desire to understand better, but the way it was approached might have been dismissive. The friend's reaction indicates that the term \"trans\" is important to her sense of self. The author's comment might have unintentionally minimized her experiences or the significance of her identity.\n\nMoreover, the author mentions that the friend has dealt with dysphoria throughout her transition. The insistence on the label might be a way for her to affirm her identity despite ongoing dysphoria. The author's suggestion that the label is unnecessary could have made her feel like her identity was being questioned, especially when she's already struggling with self-perception.\n\nIn terms of social media advice, similar situations often emphasize the importance of respecting how people identify themselves. Even if someone doesn't understand the reasoning, respecting the labels others choose for themselves is a key part of being an ally. The author's approach here might have been seen as challenging her identity, which can be hurtful.\n\nSo, putting it all together: while the author might not have malicious intent, the act of questioning her self-identification in that context likely crossed a boundary. The friend's emotional response highlights how important this label is to her. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong because they didn't respect her chosen identity terms, even if they didn't mean to.\n"
