She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is a trans woman who has been transitioning for years and is happy, but she mentions dealing with dysphoria and not feeling enough like a girl. The author is confused because the friend insists on using \"trans girl\" instead of just \"girl,\" and the author questions why she needs the label. The friend then gets upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend identifies as trans, which is part of her identity. The author is a cis person, so maybe they don't fully grasp the importance of labels in the trans community. Labels like \"trans\" can be important for self-identification and community belonging. Even if someone feels some dysphoria, their gender identity is still valid. The author's question might come off as dismissive or invalidating of her identity. \n\nWhen the author asks, \"if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" that could be seen as implying that being trans is an unnecessary label. The friend's reaction is strong, which suggests that the author's comment hurt her feelings or made her feel disrespected. \n\nI should consider that the author's intention might not be malicious, but the impact of their words is what matters here. Even if the author is trying to be helpful or curious, questioning someone's identity can be harmful. The trans community often faces invalidation, so such comments can exacerbate dysphoria or feelings of not belonging. \n\nThe key points here are respect for identity, understanding that labels matter, and the potential harm in questioning someone's self-identification. The author might not realize how their question could be perceived as undermining the friend's identity. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's choice to identify as trans, which is a core part of her self-perception despite her dysphoria.\n"
