She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is transgender, assigned male at birth, and identifies as a girl. She's been happier since transitioning but still experiences dysphoria. The author is confused because she insists on being called \"trans\" in every statement, like \"I'm a trans girl.\" The author, as a cis person, doesn't see the importance of the label and thinks it might contribute to her problems. They asked her why she needs to specify \"trans,\" and she got upset, saying it's not that simple.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend uses the label \"trans\" as part of her identity. Even though she's happy transitioning, the author is suggesting that the label might be an issue. But trans individuals often use the term \"trans\" as a way to affirm their identity and navigate their experiences. The author is making an assumption that the label is causing her issues, which could be invalidating.\n\nThe author's question is about whether they're wrong for challenging the friend's self-identification. In many cases, people use labels to describe their identity, and suggesting they shouldn't can be seen as dismissive. The friend's reaction is understandable because identity labels are deeply personal and important for self-acceptance. The author might not grasp the significance of the term \"trans\" beyond just being a label; it's part of her journey and community belonging.\n\nAlso, the author is cisgender, so they might not understand the necessity of the term. However, even if they're coming from a place of confusion, telling someone to stop identifying as part of a group they belong to can be hurtful. The friend's dysphoria is ongoing, and terms like \"trans\" might help her articulate her experiences and seek support.\n\nSo, the author is probably in the wrong because they're questioning a fundamental part of their friend's identity without understanding the reasons behind it. The friend's use of \"trans\" is her choice, and the author's comment may have invalidated her feelings and experiences.\n"
