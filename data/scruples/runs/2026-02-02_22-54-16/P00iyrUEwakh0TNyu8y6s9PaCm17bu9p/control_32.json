She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's happy with her decision but still experiences dysphoria and doesn't feel like a girl enough. The author mentioned that the friend includes \"trans\" in every statement, like \"I'm a trans girl\" instead of just \"I'm a girl.\" The author questioned why she needs to specify, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is cisgender, so they might not grasp the significance of labels like \"trans\" for someone who's transgender. The friend identifies as a trans girl, which is part of her identity. Even if she's happy, the term \"trans\" is important for her to acknowledge her gender identity and the journey she's taken. The author's comment could be seen as minimizing her identity or suggesting that her identity is less valid if she doesn't constantly specify \"trans.\" \n\nIn many cases, the term \"trans\" is used to affirm someone's identity and to signal that they're part of the transgender community. It's a way of self-identification that others might not understand unless they're in a similar position. The author's confusion might stem from their own perspective as a cis person. However, even if the author's intentions were to help or simplify things, questioning her need to use the term could come off as dismissive or invalidating. \n\nThe friend's reaction, going off on the author, suggests that the topic is sensitive and important to her. The author might not realize that by pushing her to not use the term \"trans,\" they're inadvertently challenging her identity. Even if the author's friend feels some dysphoria, the use of the term \"trans\" might be a way of coping or expressing that she is working through her identity. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is cis, the friend's use of \"trans\" is part of her identity, the author's question could be seen as invalidating, and the friend's strong reaction indicates that the topic is significant. The author might not be in the wrong if they had good intentions, but the act of telling someone they shouldn't use a term that's important to their identity is likely hurtful, regardless of intent. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect their friend's chosen labels, which are crucial for her identity and self-expression.\n"
