She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The author's friend is a transgender girl who's happy with her decision, but she mentions dealing with dysphoria and doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author noticed she always includes \"trans\" when referring to herself, like saying \"I'm a trans girl\" instead of just \"I'm a girl.\" The author questioned her about it, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The friend identifies as a trans girl, which is part of her identity. The author is suggesting that maybe she doesn't need to specify \"trans\" because she's a girl. The author's intention might have been to simplify her identity, but the friend took offense. \n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Well, in the trans community, the term \"trans\" is important for self-identification and recognition of their journey. Even if someone is happy with their gender identity, the term \"trans\" can signify their experience as a transgender person. The author might be dismissing the significance of that label, which can be hurtful. By questioning her use of the term, the author could be invalidating her identity, even if unintentionally. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be coming from a place of concern, thinking that maybe focusing less on the \"trans\" label could help with her dysphoria. However, it's not for the author to decide what's best for the friend's identity. Transgender individuals often find the labels important for their self-expression and community. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction was strong\u2014\"I can't believe you would say that\"\u2014indicating that the author's question was particularly hurtful. Even if the author didn't mean to, the impact of the question was to make the friend feel misunderstood or invalidated. \n\nAnother angle: the author is a cisgender person, so they might not fully grasp the necessity of the label. But that doesn't excuse the question if it comes off as dismissive. The correct approach would have been to ask the friend how she feels about her labels, rather than telling her to stop using them.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's question, regardless of intent, likely came across as invalidating the friend's identity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
