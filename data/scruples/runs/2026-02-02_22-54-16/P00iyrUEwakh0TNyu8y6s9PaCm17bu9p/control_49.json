She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who is a trans girl and the author told her to stop calling herself trans.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend has dealt with dysphoria and transitioned, but still feels disconnected from being a girl. The author, as a cis person, questions why she needs to include \"trans\" in her identity. \n\nThe friend got upset and called the author an a-hole. So, is the author wrong? Well, trans individuals often use labels to affirm their identity. Even if someone is transitioning or has gender dysphoria, identifying as trans is a common and important way to express their gender. \n\nThe author might not realize that being trans is a core part of her friend's identity, regardless of how much they feel like a girl. It's possible that the friend uses the term to acknowledge her journey and the challenges she's faced. The author's question could come off as dismissive or invalidating, especially if the friend feels that her identity isn't fully accepted without the label.\n\nAlso, the author's assumption that not using the label would resolve her friend's issues might not be accurate. The friend's dysphoria is a deep-seated issue that isn't necessarily tied to the term \"trans.\" Removing the label could make the friend feel like her experience isn't valid. \n\nFurthermore, as a cis person, the author may not grasp the significance of such labels in the trans community. It's important to respect how others identify themselves, even if the reasoning isn't fully understood. \n\nSo, based on this, the author likely overstepped by questioning her friend's self-identification. The friend's reaction is a valid response to feeling invalidated. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
