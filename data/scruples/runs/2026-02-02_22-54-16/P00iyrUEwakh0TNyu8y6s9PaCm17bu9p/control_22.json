She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is a trans girl who transitioned and is happy, but still experiences dysphoria and sometimes says she doesn't feel enough like a girl. The author noticed that the friend insists on labeling herself as \"trans\" in every statement, like \"I'm a trans girl\" instead of just \"a girl.\" The author questions why she needs that label and suggests she might be in the wrong for focusing on the trans identity, which leads to an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are about identity labels and the role of the trans label in someone's self-identification. The author is cisgender, so they might not fully grasp the significance of the label. But the friend is using the trans label to express her identity, possibly as part of her journey and to connect with a community.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to question that. From what I know, people use labels to affirm their identity, especially in the context of gender. For trans individuals, identifying as trans can be a way to acknowledge their transition and navigate their identity. Even if someone struggles with dysphoria or feels uncertain at times, the label might still be important for their self-expression and community belonging.\n\nBy telling the friend to stop using the trans label, the author might be dismissing the friend's self-identification. Even if the author's intention was to help or understand, it's possible they didn't consider how the label functions for the friend. The friend's strong reaction suggests that the label holds personal significance, and the author's question could be seen as invalidating her experience.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the author is likely in the wrong because they questioned a core aspect of their friend's identity without fully understanding the reasons behind it. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
