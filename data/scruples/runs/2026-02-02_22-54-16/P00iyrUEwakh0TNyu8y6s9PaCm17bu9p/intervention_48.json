She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is transgender, assigned male at birth, and has been identifying as a trans girl. The author noticed that she uses the term \"trans\" frequently and questioned her about it. The friend got upset, saying it's not that simple.\n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is that since the friend is a girl, maybe the term \"trans\" is contributing to her dysphoria. But wait, the friend has dysphoria regardless, so maybe the labels are important to her identity. Trans people often use the term to describe their identity, even if they're comfortable in their gender. It's part of their identity and how they see themselves. The author's question might come off as invalidating. Even if they meant well, questioning someone's self-identification can be hurtful. The friend's reaction suggests that the term is significant to her, and the author might not understand why. So, the author's intention might be to help, but the way they approached it was incorrect. They should respect her self-identification without trying to change it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
