She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's been happy with her decision but has dealt with dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author brought up the issue of the friend specifying \"trans\" in her identity, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend identifies as a trans girl and includes \"trans\" in her self-identification. The author, as a cis person, might not grasp the significance of such labels. The key point here is whether the author overstepped by questioning the friend's need to identify as trans. \n\nTransgender individuals often use labels to affirm their identity and gain a sense of community and recognition. The term \"trans\" can be important for self-identification and for others to understand their journey. The author's question, while perhaps coming from a place of concern, might have invalidated the friend's experience. \n\nThe friend's reaction\u2014getting upset and feeling the author doesn't understand\u2014suggests that the author's comment was hurtful. Even if the author didn't mean to, the act of questioning someone's identity can be seen as dismissive. The friend's statement \"it's not that simple\" indicates that the author didn't fully grasp the complexity of her experience. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they questioned a core part of their friend's identity based on their own lack of understanding. It's important to respect how others identify themselves, even if it doesn't make sense from a different perspective. The author didn't have the right to challenge the friend's self-identification, especially without a deeper understanding of the reasons behind it.\n"
