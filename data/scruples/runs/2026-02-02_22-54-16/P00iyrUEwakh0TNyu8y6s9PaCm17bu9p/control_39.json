She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is a trans girl who has been transitioning for years and is happy. However, she mentions dealing with dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author, a cis person, noticed that the friend always includes \"trans\" when identifying herself, like \"I'm a trans girl.\" The author is confused about the necessity of the label and asked the friend why she specifies \"trans,\" leading to an argument.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The friend's identity as transgender is an important part of her self-identification. For many trans people, using the term \"trans\" is a way to affirm their identity and acknowledge their journey. Even if the author doesn't see the need for the label, dismissing it can come across as invalidating. The author's question might have unintentionally minimized the friend's experience, especially since the friend has dealt with dysphoria and the significance of labels might be more about self-acceptance and community for her.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of directly questioning the friend's use of the term could have been perceived as a challenge to her identity, which is sensitive. Even if the author's intention wasn't to be harmful, the result was hurtful. The response from the friend indicates that the topic is sensitive and important to her. The author might not fully grasp the emotional weight behind the labels and identity terms.\n\nIn terms of cultural competence, it's important to respect how individuals define themselves. Even if someone doesn't understand the reasoning, respecting the self-identification is key. The author's actions were well-meaning but lacked the cultural sensitivity and understanding needed in such situations. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong by not respecting the friend's self-identified labels without judgment.\n"
