She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe friend is a transgender girl assigned male at birth. She came out and is happy, but she still experiences dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author is confused because she insists on identifying as \"trans girl\" instead of just \"girl.\" The author questions why she needs to specify \"trans,\" which leads to an argument where the friend gets upset and says it's not that simple.\n\nFirst, I should consider the importance of identity labels in the LGBTQ+ community. For many trans people, using the term \"trans\" is a way to acknowledge their identity and the challenges they've faced. It can be a source of pride and solidarity. The author might not realize that the term isn't just a label but a significant part of the person's identity.\n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that the term \"trans\" is important to her. Even if she feels dysphoria, the author's question might come across as invalidating her experience. The author is assuming that because they don't see the need for the label, the friend shouldn't either. This could be seen as dismissive of her self-identification.\n\nHowever, the author's intention might have been to understand why the label is important, not to attack her identity. But the way they phrased the question could have been hurtful. The friend might feel that her identity is being questioned or that her trans identity is being downplayed, which is a sensitive issue.\n\nIn many cases, it's about respecting how others choose to identify themselves. Even if the author doesn't understand the necessity, it's not their place to dictate how someone should label themselves. The key here is whether the author overstepped by questioning her identity, which they did. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's chosen identity language.\n"
