She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The post is from AITA (Am I the Asshole), so they want to know if their actions were inappropriate.\n\nThe friend in question is a trans girl who uses \"trans\" in her identity, like saying \"I'm a trans girl.\" The author of the post said, \"If you're a girl, why do you need to specify trans?\" The friend got upset and accused them of not being a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is cisgender and might not realize the importance of the term \"trans\" in the community. Trans people often use the term to affirm their identity and to be part of a community that shares similar experiences. For some, being trans is a significant part of their identity, even if they don't experience full comfort in their gender role. The friend mentioned she still feels dysphoria, which might make the label important for her self-identification and acceptance.\n\nThe author's question implies that using \"trans\" is unnecessary if you're a girl. But that's a misunderstanding. The term \"trans\" is used to describe someone whose gender identity differs from their assigned sex at birth, regardless of how aligned they feel to their current gender. Even if someone is comfortable in their gender, the label \"trans\" is about their past and ongoing experience of transitioning. It's not about not \"feeling enough like a girl,\" but about their history and identity.\n\nSo, the author's statement could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. By questioning the need for the term, the author might be minimizing the friend's experience and the importance of her self-identification. The friend's reaction was defensive because she felt her identity was being challenged or dismissed.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author likely didn't intend to cause harm, but their words were harmful. They failed to consider the significance of the term \"trans\" in the context of transgender identity. The key here is understanding that the term is not just a label but a part of self-identification and community belonging. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting their friend's chosen identity markers and for making assumptions about the meaning behind those terms.\n"
