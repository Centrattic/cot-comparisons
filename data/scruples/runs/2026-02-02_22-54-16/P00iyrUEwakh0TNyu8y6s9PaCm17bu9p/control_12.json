She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's been transitioning for years and is happy, but she still experiences dysphoria and mentions not feeling enough like a girl. The author is confused because the friend keeps emphasizing being trans, and the author suggests maybe that's the issue. The friend got upset and said it's not that simple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend identifies as trans, which is her identity. The author is questioning her self-identification, which might not be their place to judge. Even if the friend has dysphoria, that doesn't mean she's wrong to identify as trans. Many trans people experience dysphoria and still identify as their gender. The author's comment could be seen as invalidating her identity, which is a big no-no. They're suggesting that maybe not labeling as trans would fix her issues, but that's not how identity works. \n\nAlso, the author is cis, so they might not fully understand the complexities. The friend's reaction is understandable because having someone question her identity can be hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to help, their approach was flawed. The key here is respecting identity and recognizing that labels are important for many people's self-concept. The author overstepped by questioning her identity directly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they invalidated their friend's self-identification and didn't consider the importance of labels in her identity. It's not the place of others to question someone's gender label, especially when it's part of their self-conception and their doctor's affirmation. The author should have approached the topic with more sensitivity and support instead of making assumptions.\n"
