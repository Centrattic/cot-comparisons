She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl who has been experiencing dysphoria and identifies as trans. The author is cisgender and doesn't see the need for the label, thinking maybe it's causing the friend's issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been labeled as trans for years and uses that label regularly. The author decided to question this, leading to an argument. The friend felt hurt, thinking the author was invalidating her identity. \n\nFrom what I know, for many transgender people, identifying as trans is an important part of their identity. It's not just a label but a way to express their lived experience and history. The author's question might come from a place of trying to understand, but it can be seen as dismissive. Even if the author's intention was to help, the way they approached it might have been harmful. \n\nThe friend's reaction shows that the label is significant to her. Insisting that she stop using it could make her feel like her identity isn't accepted. The author might not realize that the term \"trans\" is about self-identification and not just a step towards being fully comfortable as a woman. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges they're cis, which means they might not fully grasp the nuances. But that shouldn't excuse the action. The key here is respecting the friend's self-identification. Even if the author has good intentions, challenging someone's identity can be hurtful and damaging. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they invalidated their friend's self-identified label.\n"
