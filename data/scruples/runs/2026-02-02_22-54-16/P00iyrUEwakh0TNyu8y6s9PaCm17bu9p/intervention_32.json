She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl who's happy with her decision but experiences dysphoria. She often refers to herself as a trans girl instead of just a girl. The author, being cis, finds this confusing and suggests she doesn't need to specify \"trans,\" which leads to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's identity is a significant part of her self-expression. For many trans individuals, using terms like \"trans girl\" is important for their identity and how they navigate the world. It's not just a label but a way to affirm their gender. The author, coming from a cis perspective, might not grasp why the label matters. However, questioning someone's self-identification can be seen as dismissive, even if the author's intention was to help.\n\nNext, the friend's reaction is strong, indicating that the term \"trans\" is crucial to her. She might feel that the author is invalidating her experience by not recognizing the importance of the label. The author's approach, while perhaps well-meaning, might not consider the emotional impact of challenging someone's self-identification, especially when the person has a history of dysphoria.\n\nI should also think about the broader societal context. The trans community often emphasizes respecting self-identified labels. Even if someone meets the criteria for being trans (like being assigned male at birth and identifying as a girl), the use of terms like \"trans\" can be a personal choice. The author's assumption that the friend's problems stem from the label might not be accurate. The friend might use the term to affirm her identity, and the author's suggestion could be perceived as minimizing her struggles.\n\nAnother angle is the author's intent. They mention that the friend has dealt with dysphoria and that the author thought the labels might be a source of her problems. However, the author approached the conversation without understanding the significance of the labels to the friend. This lack of understanding and the way the question was phrased could have been hurtful.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions, while stemming from a place of concern, likely caused harm by not respecting the friend's self-identified terms. The friend's strong reaction indicates that the term \"trans\" is integral to her identity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the importance of the label and for challenging someone's self-identification without understanding the deeper reasons behind it.\n"
