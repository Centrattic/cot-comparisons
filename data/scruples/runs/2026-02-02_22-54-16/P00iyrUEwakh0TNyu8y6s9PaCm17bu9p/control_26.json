She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a transgender girl who was assigned male at birth and has been dealing with dysphoria. The author noticed that the friend insists on identifying as a \"trans girl\" instead of just a girl and questioned her about it. The friend got upset and accused the author of being unsupportive.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what being transgender entails. Transgender individuals identify with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth. For many, using the term \"trans\" is important for self-identification and recognition of their gender identity. It's a part of their identity and can have significant meaning, especially in terms of visibility and acceptance.\n\nThe author's argument is that since the friend is happy being a girl, why does she need to specify \"trans\"? This seems to miss the point that being transgender is a core part of her identity, separate from her current gender expression or happiness. Even if she's happy now, the term \"trans\" acknowledges her past and ongoing experience with gender transition. It's not just about how she feels currently but about her journey and how she wants to be perceived.\n\nThe friend's reaction was defensive and emotional. She felt the author was undermining her identity by questioning the use of \"trans.\" The author's question might have come across as invalidating her self-identification. Even if the author's intention was to understand, the approach might have been too direct or dismissive of the importance of labels in the transgender community.\n\nAlso, the author mentions being a cis person (not identifying as trans or non-binary). Cis allies sometimes have good intentions but may not fully grasp the nuances of trans experiences. It's possible that the author didn't realize that for many trans people, the label is crucial for their identity and community belonging.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, questioning someone's self-identification, especially in a way that suggests it's unnecessary, can be seen as disrespectful. Trans individuals often have to navigate societal misgendering and invalidation. Suggesting they stop using a label they choose can be hurtful, even if the question is framed as a genuine inquiry.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because they questioned an essential part of their friend's identity. The friend's emotional response indicates that the question was hurtful and not well-received. The author should have approached the topic with more sensitivity and respect for the friend's self-identification, perhaps by listening more and asking why the term is important rather than challenging it.\n"
