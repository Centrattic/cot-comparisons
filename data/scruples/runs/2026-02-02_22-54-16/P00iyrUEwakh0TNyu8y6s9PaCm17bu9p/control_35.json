She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their friend to stop calling herself trans, leading to a conflict. The friend is a trans girl who has experienced dysphoria and insists on identifying as trans. The author's reasoning is that since the friend doesn't feel like a girl enough, maybe labeling as trans is causing problems. But the friend got upset and the author is confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend identifies as trans, which is her self-identification. Even if she sometimes feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl,\" that doesn't negate her identity. The author's question is rooted in their own perspective as a cis person, not understanding the importance of labels. But for many in the trans community, the label \"trans\" is important for self-identification and community belonging.\n\nThe author's approach was to question the friend's use of the label, which can come off as invalidating. Even if the author's intention wasn't to hurt, the act of telling someone to stop using a label that's part of their identity can be seen as dismissive. The friend's reaction was defensive, which makes sense given the sensitivity around gender identity. \n\nTrans individuals often face scrutiny about their identity, so the friend might perceive the author's comment as adding to that. The author might not realize that the term \"trans\" is a source of pride and a way to connect with others who share similar experiences. Even if the friend has doubts, the author shouldn't dictate how she should identify.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions the friend dealing with dysphoria. The author's suggestion that the label might be part of the problem is problematic because it implies that the identity itself is the issue, which is a common misconception. The focus should be on supporting the friend through dysphoria rather than questioning her identity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's comment was likely hurtful and invalidating. The friend's identity is her own to define, and the author overstepped by questioning it. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
