She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who has been happy with her transition but still experiences dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author's main argument is that since the friend doesn't feel entirely like a girl, maybe she shouldn't identify as trans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend identifies as trans and that's part of her identity. The author is questioning that identity based on her own feelings of not feeling like a girl. But the key point here is the author's right to challenge the friend's self-identification. \n\nTransgender identity is a personal and deeply significant aspect of someone's identity. Even if someone has doubts or dysphoria, their self-identification as trans is valid. The author's statement that \"if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" seems to dismiss the importance of the trans label. This could be seen as invalidating her experience and identity. \n\nThe author might not understand that for many trans people, the label \"trans\" is important for community, visibility, and understanding their own experiences. Even if the friend sometimes feels uncertain, her right to identify as trans isn't contingent on feeling completely like a girl all the time. \n\nThe friend's reaction was emotional, which suggests that the author's comments were hurtful. The author's approach was to question her identity based on their own perspective as a cis person, which can be harmful. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they invalidated their friend's identity. \n\nI should also consider if there's any nuance. The author might be concerned about the friend's well-being, but the way they expressed it was inappropriate. The core issue is about respecting self-identified labels regardless of others' opinions. So the answer is A.\n"
