She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is a transgender girl who's been out for years and is happy, though she still experiences dysphoria and says she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author's issue is that the friend always includes \"trans\" in her identity, like \"I'm a trans girl,\" and the author thinks maybe she's causing her own problems by clinging to that label. They brought it up and got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend is transgender and uses \"trans\" as part of her identity. The author, being cisgender, might not grasp the significance of that label. Trans individuals often use \"trans\" to acknowledge their gender identity, especially since it's a part of their lived experience. Even if someone is happy in their identity, the term \"trans\" can be important for visibility and community. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the friend is a girl, she shouldn't need to specify \"trans.\" But for many trans people, the term is necessary because it clarifies their identity, especially in a society that still pathologizes or misunderstands transgender individuals. The friend might also be reinforcing her identity as part of the trans community, which is a valid choice. \n\nThe friend was defensive and called the author an a-hole. That suggests the author's comment was hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to help, the approach might have been dismissive. It's possible they didn't consider that the label isn't just about the person's current identity but also their journey and how they want to be perceived. \n\nAlso, the author's comment could be seen as implying that being trans is problematic or unnecessary. The friend's dysphoria might be a part of her experience, and using the term \"trans\" could be a way to connect with others who have similar experiences. The author's question might have invalidated her choice to use the label, which can be a big deal for someone who's already dealing with dysphoria. \n\nIn terms of social norms, the general advice is to respect how people choose to identify themselves. If someone insists on using a particular label, it's usually best to go along with it unless they specify not to. The author might have been trying to be supportive but crossed a line by questioning her self-identification, which is a core aspect of her identity. \n\nSo, even if the friend is happy, the term \"trans\" is a part of her identity that she's chosen. The author's question probably came off as dismissive or judgmental. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
