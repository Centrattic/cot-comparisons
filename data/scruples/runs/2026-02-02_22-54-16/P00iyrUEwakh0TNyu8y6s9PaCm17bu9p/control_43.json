I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of a Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is a transgender woman who's been out for years and is generally happy, but she still experiences dysphoria and feels she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl.\" The author noticed she always includes \"trans\" in her identity, like \"I'm a trans girl,\" and the author finds this odd. The author then confronted the friend, asking why she needs to specify trans if she's a girl, which led to an argument. The friend got upset, and the author is now seeking opinions on Reddit.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the use of identity labels. The author, being cis, might not understand the significance of the term \"trans\" in the friend's self-identification. The friend's insistence on using \"trans\" could be a way to affirm her identity, especially if she's dealing with ongoing dysphoria. Even if she's happy in her transition, the term might be important for her to navigate her experiences and seek community support.\n\nThe author's question is whether they're in the wrong. From a social justice perspective, respecting someone's chosen identity labels is crucial. The author's comment could be seen as dismissive of the friend's need to self-identify as trans, even if the friend is also a girl. The term \"trans\" is not just a label but part of her identity that she might use to connect with others who share similar experiences, which is especially important if she's facing dysphoria.\n\nHowever, the author's intention might have been to help the friend by questioning the necessity of the label, thinking it might be contributing to her issues. But in doing so, the author didn't consider that the label is significant to the friend's self-concept. This lack of understanding and the way the conversation was approached likely hurt the friend, as it's a personal and sensitive topic.\n\nIn such cases, it's important to listen and validate the individual's feelings and choices, even if one doesn't fully understand. The author might have overstepped by challenging the friend's identity labels without understanding the deeper reasons behind them. So, the answer here would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the friend's self-identification as trans is a personal choice that should be respected, and the author's question was dismissive of that.\n"
