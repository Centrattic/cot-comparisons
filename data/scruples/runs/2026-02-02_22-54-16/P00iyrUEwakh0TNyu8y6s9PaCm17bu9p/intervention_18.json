She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author who told their friend to stop calling herself trans is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend, who is trans, uses \"trans girl\" when identifying, and the author questions why she needs to specify \"trans.\" The friend then gets upset.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the term \"trans\" signifies. Trans is a label that identifies someone whose gender identity doesn't match the sex they were assigned at birth. For many trans people, the label is important because it acknowledges their identity and experience. It's part of how they express themselves and connect with the community.\n\nThe author's friend is trans, as she was assigned male and identifies as a girl. She uses the term \"trans girl,\" which is a valid way to self-identify. The author is questioning why she can't just say \"girl,\" implying that maybe her problems stem from clinging to the label. But the friend's response indicates that her identity isn't that simple, which the author might not fully grasp.\n\nNow, the key here is understanding that gender identity is personal and complex. Even if someone doesn't feel they \"feel enough like a girl,\" that's their internal experience, and the label \"trans\" helps them navigate the external world. The author's approach, while perhaps coming from a place of concern, dismisses the importance of that label. Telling someone to stop using a term that's significant to their identity can be hurtful, regardless of intent.\n\nThe author's confusion is understandable, but they may not realize that for trans individuals, the label is a crucial part of their identity. It's not just about the label itself but the validation and community it represents. The friend's frustration when the author questions it is valid because it's an attack on her self-identification.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's question was likely an invalidation of their friend's identity, which is why the friend was upset. Even if the author's intentions were good, the action of telling someone how they should or shouldn't identify is generally considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
