She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who has been transitioning for years and is happy, but she mentions dealing with dysphoria and not feeling like a girl enough. The author noticed that she always includes \"trans\" in her identity, like \"trans girl,\" and questioned her about it, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend identifies as trans, which is an important part of her identity. For many trans people, the term \"trans\" is a key part of how they express their gender identity. Even if someone else might not see the significance of labels, the author's friend might find it important for self-identification and community connection.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the friend is a girl, she shouldn't need to specify \"trans.\" But that's a misunderstanding. Being trans isn't about not being the gender they identify with; it's about their gender identity not aligning with the sex they were assigned at birth. The term \"trans\" is a label that encompasses their experience. The fact that she still feels dysphoria doesn't negate her identity; many trans people experience dysphoria even after transitioning.\n\nBy questioning her identity, the author might be invalidating her self-identification. Even if the friend is happy, the author's comment could come off as dismissive of her need to define herself as trans. The friend's reaction was strong, which suggests that the author's words were hurtful or perceived as an attack on her identity.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they're cis, so their perspective might not account for the social and personal significance of labels for trans individuals. It's possible the author didn't realize that \"trans\" is a core part of her friend's identity, regardless of her feelings about dysphoria or how she feels about her gender internally.\n\nSo, even if the author's intentions were to help or simplify things, the action of questioning her identity is likely harmful. The friend's emotional response indicates that the author's words were unhelpful and possibly hurtful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
