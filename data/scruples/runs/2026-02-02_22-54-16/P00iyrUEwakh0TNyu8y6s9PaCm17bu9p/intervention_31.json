She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's been transitioning for years and is happy. However, she sometimes says she doesn't feel like a girl enough and uses \"trans\" in her identity. The author brought up why she needs to specify \"trans\" and the friend got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is cisgender and might not fully grasp the significance of the term \"trans\" in her friend's identity. The friend uses \"trans\" as part of her self-identification, which is common among trans people. Even if someone is happy in their identity, the term \"trans\" can be important for acknowledging their gender journey and history. \n\nThe author's friend mentioned dealing with dysphoria and feeling she doesn't \"feel enough like a girl,\" which might make the term \"trans\" a key part of her identity. The author's question, while coming from a place of confusion, might have invalidated her friend's feelings. The friend's reaction suggests that the term is important to her, even if the author doesn't see why.\n\nLabels can be significant for self-identification. Even if the author doesn't understand the necessity, it's not their place to question someone's self-identification. The author might have missed the point of respecting their friend's identity. So, while the author's intention might not be malicious, the act of questioning the term could be seen as invalidating. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
