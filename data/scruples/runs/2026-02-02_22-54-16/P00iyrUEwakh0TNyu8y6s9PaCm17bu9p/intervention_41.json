She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend is a trans girl assigned male at birth who's been out for years and is happy, but she mentions dealing with dysphoria and not feeling like a girl enough. The author is confused because she insists on using \"trans\" in her identity, and he questions why she needs to specify that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of gender identity. Trans individuals often identify as trans because it's part of their self-understanding. Even if someone might not \"feel enough\" like the gender they identify with, their experience and self-identification are valid. The author's friend might use the term \"trans\" to acknowledge her journey and identity, even if she's happy with her current gender. \n\nThe author's question implies that maybe the friend's issues stem from the label itself. But that's a cis-centric view. The author might not grasp that labels are important for many trans people as a way to articulate their identity, especially if they've gone through transition. The friend's reaction was defensive, which makes sense because questioning someone's identity can be hurtful, even if the author's intention was to help.\n\nThen there's the aspect of dysphoria. The friend mentions dealing with it throughout her transition. Dysphoria is a real and ongoing struggle for some trans people, even if they're happy with their gender. The author might not understand that the label \"trans\" can be part of her coping or identity, even if she's not entirely comfortable in her body. \n\nThe friend's anger suggests that the author overstepped. It's possible he didn't consider that the label is meaningful to her, and challenging it came off as invalidating. Even if he's a well-meaning friend, questioning someone's identity directly can be seen as transphobic, regardless of intent. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in the wrong because he dismissed the importance of the label \"trans\" in his friend's identity without understanding her perspective. He should respect her self-identification, even if he can't fully grasp it. The correct answer is A.\n"
