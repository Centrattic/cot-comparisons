She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AskReddit-style post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. I need to figure out if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the friend is transgender and has been identifying as a trans girl for years. She mentions dealing with dysphoria and sometimes not feeling like a girl. The author, who is cisgender, noticed she always includes \"trans\" when identifying herself and questioned her about it. The friend got upset, and the author is now confused about whether they did something wrong.\n\nSo, the key point here is about the use of labels and identity. The author suggested that if she's a girl, why specify as trans. But in the trans community, the term \"trans\" is part of one's identity. Even if someone is happy with their gender identity, being trans is a core part of their identity, especially for those who transitioned. The author not understanding the importance of the label might be a lack of awareness or sensitivity.\n\nThe author's friend took offense and called the author an a-hole. The author is now asking if they're at fault. Trans people often face invalidation, and questioning their identity can be hurtful. Even if the author's intention wasn't to be harmful, the act of challenging her self-identification as trans could be seen as invalidating her experience.\n\nAlso, the author might not fully grasp that for many trans individuals, the label is empowering and necessary for their identity, regardless of their current feelings about body dysphoria. Saying \"trans\" acknowledges their journey and the challenges they've faced. The author's comment might come across as minimizing her identity or suggesting she shouldn't be trans if she doesn't feel \"enough\" like a girl, which is a common form of transphobia.\n\nTherefore, the author likely overstepped by questioning her self-identification. They should respect her chosen labels and identity without trying to impose their own views. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
