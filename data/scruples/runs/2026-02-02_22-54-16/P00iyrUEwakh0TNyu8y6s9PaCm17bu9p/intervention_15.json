She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their friend not to call herself trans, because the friend is a trans girl but doesn't feel like a girl enough. The author is confused about why the friend needs to specify \"trans\" every time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of transgender terminology. As far as I know, the term \"trans\" is important for people who identify as such because it acknowledges their gender identity and the transition they've undergone. It's part of their identity. Even if someone feels they don't \"feel enough like a girl,\" if they identify as a girl and have transitioned, they still might identify as trans. So the author's question about why she needs to specify \"trans\" might be coming from a place of not understanding the significance of the term in her identity.\n\nThe author's friend got upset, which suggests that the term is important to her. The author might not realize that the label isn't just about how one feels physically or socially at a given moment, but about self-identification. Even if someone struggles with dysphoria, their identity as trans is still valid. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that maybe the friend's problems come from using the label, but that's a common cisgender perspective. It's possible the author is making an assumption that the label is the issue, not the underlying dysphoria or social challenges. The friend's reaction indicates that the term is crucial to her self-identity, regardless of the author's confusion.\n\nSo, in terms of respect and understanding, the author might have overstepped by questioning her self-identification. The friend's identity is her own to define, and the author's role should be to support that unless there's a clear harm. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
