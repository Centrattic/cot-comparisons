She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their trans friend to stop identifying as trans. The friend identifies as a trans girl (assigned male at birth) but has mentioned struggling with dysphoria and not feeling \"enough like a girl.\" The author questioned why she insists on using \"trans\" labels, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been transitioning and is generally happy, but still has issues with dysphoria. The author's comment about questioning the need for the \"trans\" label might come across as invalidating. Even if the author is cis and doesn't understand the importance of labels, it's important to recognize that for many trans people, the label is a crucial part of their identity. It's not just about a label but about affirming their gender identity and navigating their experiences.\n\nThe author's friend was upset, which suggests that the comment was hurtful. The phrase \"it's not that simple\" indicates that the author oversimplified a complex issue. The author's lack of understanding doesn't excuse the action. Even if the author had good intentions, questioning someone's identity can be harmful and dismissive. Trans individuals often face invalidation and discrimination, so this kind of comment can exacerbate their struggles. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not respecting their friend's self-identified label without fully understanding the reasons behind it.\n"
