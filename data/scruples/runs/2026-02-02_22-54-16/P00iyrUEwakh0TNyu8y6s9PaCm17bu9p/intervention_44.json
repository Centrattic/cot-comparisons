She is happy with her decision, and everyone who knows her agrees shes been much happier since. \n\nHowever, she has dealt with disphoria throughout the whole thing, and has spoken to me more than once about how she doesnt \"feel enough like a girl.\"\n\nFor the longest time this conversation bugged me because of one thing: she insisted on including \"trans\" in every thing. \"Im a trans girl\" or other such statements instead of just \"im a girl.\" Maybe as a cis person i dont understand the importance of labels, but it feels to me like that might be a source of her problems. \n\nWell the last time we spoke i brought this up to her and she went off. \"I cant believe you would say that, i thought you were my friend\" which i really really didnt understand. I said \"well if you're a girl why do you need to specify trans?\" And she said \"its not that simple a-hole.\"\n\nIm confused Reddit am I a turd here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their friend to stop calling herself trans. The friend is a trans girl who's been struggling with dysphoria and has mentioned not feeling enough like a girl. The author is confused because the friend insists on using the label \"trans girl\" instead of just \"girl,\" and the author thinks maybe that's causing her problems. They had a fight where the author questioned the need for the label, and the friend was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both angles. The author is cisgender and might not grasp the importance of identity labels for trans people. The friend identifies as trans, which is a key part of her self-identity, even if she's experiencing dysphoria. The author's confusion stems from not seeing the necessity of the label, but for many trans people, the label \"trans\" is about acknowledging their gender identity beyond their assigned sex at birth. It's a way to assert their gender in a society that often doesn't recognize it.\n\nThe author's question is whether they're in the wrong. The key here is understanding that the friend's use of \"trans\" is part of her identity, regardless of her current feelings about dysphoria. Even if she's not feeling fully comfortable in her identity, the label remains important for her self-identification. The author, as a cis person, might not see how the label affects her friend, but trans individuals often use labels to define their experiences and seek community support.\n\nThe author brought up the issue directly, which might have been seen as invalidating. Even if the author's intention was to help, questioning someone's identity labels can be hurtful and dismissive. The friend's reaction shows that this was a sensitive topic, and the author's approach might have been too direct or not empathetic enough. It's important to respect how others identify themselves, even if there's confusion or disagreement.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action of telling their friend to stop using the trans label is likely inconsiderate and dismissive of her identity. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
