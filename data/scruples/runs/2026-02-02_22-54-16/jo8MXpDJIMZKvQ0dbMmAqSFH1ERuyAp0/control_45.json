Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The scenario is that there are more washers than dryers, so the author found all dryers taken. They saw other people's wet clothes around. The girl in question had one item in the dryer set for 75 minutes. The author took it out after about 40 minutes because it was already dry, hung it up, and then later got a note from her.\n\nSo the main points here: the dryers are limited, which creates a conflict. The author tried to free up a dryer by taking someone else's clothes early. The girl was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview, which might have been important. The author claims that after taking the item out, the dryer became available, leading others to use it, so maybe they were helping.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, taking someone else's belongings without permission is a no-go. Even if the intention was to help, unauthorized removal of someone else's property is a violation. However, the author might argue that the dryer was being underutilized (only one item), and they were trying to optimize the shared resource. But the key here is that the author didn't ask for permission. Even if the dryer was set for a long time, the owner had the right to be there. The blazer being for an interview adds context that the timing was crucial for her. The author's action caused her inconvenience, which could be significant. So, while the author's intention might be understandable, the action itself is a breach of trust and respect for others' belongings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
