Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking someone else's clothes out of a dryer. The user is asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, the setup: the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author found all dryers occupied, with lots of wet clothes around. So they took someone else's item that had been in the dryer for 75 minutes, which was already dry, and hung it up. Then the woman left a note mad about it, saying she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nSo, the key points here. The dryers are a limited resource. The author saw that all dryers were taken and there were many wet clothes. Maybe the system is backed up? The author took one item out because it was already dry, helping to free up the dryer. But the problem is that they took someone else's clothes. \n\nOwnership is a big factor. Even if the dryer is full, taking someone else's items without permission is generally not okay. But maybe the justification is that the dryer was being misused (only one item in a dryer for 75 minutes is inefficient), and the author was trying to help free up the machine. However, the other person had a valid reason (job interview), so they might have been in a hurry. \n\nThe author claims that by taking the item, they freed up the dryer, and others' clothes started disappearing. But the act of taking someone else's property without permission is a problem regardless of intent. Even if the intention was good, it's not the author's clothes, so taking them without consent is a violation. \n\nOn the other hand, the system is inefficient with only 4 dryers and 6 washers, leading to a backlog. The author might have tried to be helpful. But the woman was using the dryer for a specific purpose, and taking her item could have delayed her. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether taking someone else's clothes is acceptable. Legally and ethically, you don't have the right to take someone else's property, even if you think you're helping. The woman's note is harsh, but the author's action was also wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
