Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The author is in a college dorm with limited dryers. They found all dryers taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. They took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, took it out after 40 minutes because it was relatively dry. Then the girl left a note angry about it.\n\nFirst, let me consider the rules or norms around shared laundry. Usually, it's understood that you don't take others' clothes without permission. But the author had a reason: the dryers were all in use, and they wanted to free up a dryer. The girl was using a dryer for a single item, which might be seen as inefficient. The author took it out early, maybe to help others get a chance to dry their clothes. \n\nBut the girl was using the dryer for her blazer for an interview, which is important. She left a note implying the author ruined her clothes. The author argues that the jacket was already dry and that their action helped clear up the dryers. However, taking someone's clothes without asking is a breach of trust and respect. Even if the author's intention was good, it's still taking something that isn't theirs. \n\nIn shared spaces, people rely on others to follow basic rules. If everyone took others' clothes to \"help,\" it could lead to more problems. The author might have been trying to solve a problem, but the right approach would have been to talk to the person first or check if they could use the dryer for a shorter cycle. \n\nSo, while the author had a good intention, taking the clothes without permission is wrong. The girl had the right to expect her clothes would stay in the dryer until she returned. The author didn't consider the ownership aspect, even if the dryer was underutilized. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
