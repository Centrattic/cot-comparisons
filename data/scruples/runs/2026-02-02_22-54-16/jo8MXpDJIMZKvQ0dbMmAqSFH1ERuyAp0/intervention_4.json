Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is in a college dorm with limited dryers. The author found all dryers taken, so they took a girl's clothes out because hers had one item and it was already dry. The girl was upset because she was using the dryer for an interview blazer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and norms of the dorm. If there's no explicit rule against taking others' clothes, maybe the author isn't at fault. But sometimes, there are unspoken rules. The author mentions that the dryer was set for 75 minutes, and they took it out after 40, when the item was already dry. That could be seen as helping to free up the dryer, which others needed. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission could be considered rude or inconsiderate, even if it's out of necessity.\n\nThe girl left a note, which is direct, but the author didn't know it was her blazer for an interview. The key points are intent and harm. The author's action may have saved the dryer for others, but the girl's item was taken prematurely. However, since it was already dry, maybe the harm was minimal. On the other hand, the blazer might need more drying, affecting her interview prep.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author acted to solve a resource problem, which is understandable. But there's a line between helping and overstepping. If the author had asked, maybe it would have been better, but they didn't. So, maybe the author is partly at fault for not checking, but the context of limited dryers and the item being dry might mitigate that. It's a gray area. I think the answer hinges on whether the action was a reasonable solution given the circumstances. Since the item was already dry and others were waiting, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. So, B (No).\n"
