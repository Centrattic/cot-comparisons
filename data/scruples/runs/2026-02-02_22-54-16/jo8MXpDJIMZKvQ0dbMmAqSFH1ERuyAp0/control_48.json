Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The scenario is from a college dorm with limited dryers. The person took clothes out of a dryer that another girl was using, which made her angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the dorm. If there's a specific policy against removing others' clothes from the dryer, then the author might be wrong. But if there's no such rule, maybe it's a judgment call. \n\nThe author mentions that the dryers were all taken, and there were piles of wet clothes. They took one item that was already mostly dry, thinking they were helping to free up the dryer. The other person was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview, which is important. However, the author didn't know whose clothes they were taking. \n\nSo, the key points are: intent to help by freeing up a dryer, lack of knowledge about whose clothes they were, and the consequence of making someone angry. \n\nBut taking someone else's clothes without permission is a privacy and ownership issue. Even if the dryer was in high demand, removing clothes without knowing whose they are could be seen as overstepping. The other person's note suggests they felt violated. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were trying to be helpful and that the clothes were already dry. But property rights matter here. Even if it was a mistake, taking someone else's belongings without permission is generally wrong, regardless of intent. \n\nSo, while the author might have had good intentions, the action itself was a breach of trust and privacy. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
