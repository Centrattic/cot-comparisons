Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the situation is about taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The person who wrote the story (the author) is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the dorm has only 4 dryers, which are all taken. The author notices that there's a lot of wet clothes around, maybe because others are taking too long. They see a dryer that's set for 75 minutes, and they take out their own clothes from a washer. Then, when they come back 40 minutes later, they find someone else's clothes still in the dryer. The author removes them to help free up the dryer. The other person gets angry and leaves a note. The author argues that by doing this, the dryer was freed up, and others' clothes were taken care of.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about ownership of the dryer. The author used the dryer for their own clothes but then took out someone else's clothes without permission. Even though the dryer was underutilized (only one item), taking someone else's clothes out without asking is a problem. The other person was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview, which might be important, but the author didn't know that. However, the author's action was a judgment call based on what they observed.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The main issue is that the dryer was already being used by someone else. Even if the other person's load wasn't taking up the whole dryer, the author took their clothes without permission. In shared spaces like dorms, it's usually expected that everyone respects others' belongings. Taking someone else's clothes without asking is a breach of that trust. Even if the author's intention was good (freeing up the dryer), the action itself was not theirs to take without consent. So, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
