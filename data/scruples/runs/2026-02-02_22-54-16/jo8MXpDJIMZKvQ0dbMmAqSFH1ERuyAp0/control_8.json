Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The user is asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, the setup: there are 6 washers and 4 dryers in the dorm. The author went to do laundry, found all dryers taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. The girl in question had one item in the dryer set for 75 minutes. The author took it out after it was relatively dry, hung it up, then came back 40 minutes later to find a note from her.\n\nThe girl was probably using the dryer to dry a blazer for an interview, which is important. The author's reasoning is that by removing her item, they freed up the dryer, which helped with the overall pile of clothes waiting. But the author didn't check whose clothes they were taking out, right? They just took something out because they thought it was taking up space and the dryer wasn't being used efficiently.\n\nNow, the question is about responsibility. Did the author have the right to take someone else's clothes without permission? Even if the intention was good (to help others by freeing up the dryer), taking someone else's property without consent is generally not okay. The girl had a legitimate use case, and the author's action disrupted her plans, possibly causing her stress or inconvenience for the interview.\n\nBut on the other hand, the dorm has a limited number of dryers, and the author was trying to solve a problem. However, the correct approach might have been to wait their turn or find another solution instead of taking someone else's clothes. The author might have assumed that the clothes in the dryer were taking too long, but without knowing whose they were. That's a key point\u2014without verifying ownership, removing items is a breach of trust and privacy.\n\nAlso, the note from the girl was sarcastic, indicating she was upset. The author might have overstepped by taking it out, even if their intention was to help. The fact that the jacket was already dry doesn't excuse the action of removing it without permission. So, the author's action was wrong because they didn't ask and took someone else's belongings. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
