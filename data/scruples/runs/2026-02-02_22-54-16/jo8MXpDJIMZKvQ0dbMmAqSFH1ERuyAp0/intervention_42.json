Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is that there were more washers than dryers, and the dryer was taking too long. The person took out the clothes because they were almost dry, which made the other person angry because they were using the dryer for an important blazer.\n\nHmm. So the main points here: the dryer was in use by someone else, the author took their clothes out early, leading to a conflict. The other person was using the dryer for a job interview, which adds some urgency for them. The author's reasoning is that the dryer was being misused (only one item in a full dryer) and that by taking it out, they helped others get access to dryers.\n\nFirst, is it okay to take someone else's clothes from the dryer? Generally, no, because that's their property and using their appliance. But the context matters. The dryer was only being used for one item, which is inefficient. The author might have had good intentions, thinking they were helping by freeing up the dryer, but they didn't own the clothes.\n\nThe other person was clearly upset because their blazer was being dried, which is important for a job interview. The author might not have known, but the note implies they could have been considerate. However, in a shared space with limited resources, there's a possible argument for communal responsibility. But taking someone's belongings without permission is usually a no-go.\n\nOn the other hand, the dryer was being underutilized (only one item), so the author's action might have been a way to optimize the resource. But that's a stretch because the ownership of the clothes is clear. Even if the dryer is shared, the clothes belong to the person who put them in. The author's action was trespassing on someone else's property.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author took someone else's belongings without permission, which is a breach of trust and ownership. Even if the intention was to help, the action itself was unauthorized. The other person has a legitimate reason to be upset because their clothes were taken out before they were done drying, which could have ruined the blazer. The author didn't consider the other person's needs, even if they thought they were acting in the community's interest.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
