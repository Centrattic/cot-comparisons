Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that there were more washers than dryers, so the author found all dryers taken. They noticed a bunch of wet clothes around, implying others weren't using the dryers efficiently. The author took a single item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, which was already relatively dry, to free up a dryer. The girl left a note angry about it because she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the scarcity of dryers and the author's action. The dryers are a shared resource, and when all are occupied, it's a problem. The author's justification is that the clothes left in the dryer weren't being used efficiently, with mounds of wet clothes around. By taking out the one item, they freed up a dryer, which helped others.\n\nBut the other person was using the dryer for an important reason\u2014a job interview. Taking someone else's clothes, even if partially dry, might be seen as interfering with their plans. However, the author didn't know it was a blazer for an interview, so intent matters. The author might argue it was an act of kindness to free up a dryer. But the other person's perspective is that their clothes were being tampered with without permission, which is a breach of trust and respect for personal property.\n\nLegally, taking someone's clothes without permission is theft, even temporarily. Ethically, it's a matter of community norms. In a dorm setting, sharing resources can lead to such issues. The author might not be in the wrong if the dryer wasn't being used efficiently, but the act of taking clothes without asking is problematic. The note the other person left shows they felt wronged. However, the author's action did help others. It's a bit of a gray area. The right answer hinges on whether the community has established rules about such situations. If there's no rule against taking someone's clothes to free up a dryer, the author might not be at fault. But if it's considered a violation of personal property, then they are. Since the author didn't check with the owner, the line is crossed. So, likely they are in the wrong, which would be answer A.\n"
