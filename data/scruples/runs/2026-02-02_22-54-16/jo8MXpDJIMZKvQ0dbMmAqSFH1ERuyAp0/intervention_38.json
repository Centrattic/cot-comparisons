Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is about a college dorm with limited dryers. The author found all dryers occupied, took a partially dry item from another person's dryer, and that person got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the dorm. If there's a policy against taking others' clothes from the dryer, then the author is definitely in the wrong. But if there's no such rule, maybe it's more about common courtesy. \n\nThe author mentions that there were \"mounds of other people's wet clothes\" around, implying that others weren't using the dryers efficiently. The person with the blazer had one item in a dryer for 75 minutes. The author took it out when it was dry, thinking it would free up the dryer for others. However, the blazer person was using the dryer for a specific purpose\u2014drying a blazer for an interview, which might require more precise drying to avoid wrinkles.\n\nThe key points here are intent and context. The author's intent was to help by freeing up a dryer, which is a resource in short supply. But the other person's need was urgent and specific. Even if the author didn't know the item was someone else's, taking it without permission could be seen as respecting others' belongings. On the other hand, the dorm's situation with limited dryers creates a shared problem, and the author's action might have been a reasonable solution to a resource scarcity issue.\n\nHowever, taking someone else's clothes, even if they're dry, is generally considered wrong because it's respecting property. The note from the angry person indicates that the blazer was important and that the drying process was time-sensitive. The author might not have realized the blazer's importance. But since the dryer was on for 75 minutes and the item was already dry, the author might have thought it was a good idea to remove it to help others.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had good intentions and the dorm's resource issue is a factor, taking someone else's belongings without permission is typically seen as incorrect. However, some might argue the context of limited resources justifies the action. But legally and ethically, it's usually about respecting others' property regardless of the situation. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
