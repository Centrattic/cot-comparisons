Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that the author's dorm has more washers than dryers, leading to a scarcity. When the author found all dryers occupied, they took a girl's clothes out because they were already dry, but the girl was upset because she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. If there are no specific dorm rules against removing others' clothes from the dryer, then the author might be in the right. But if there are established norms, like not taking others' items, the author could be wrong. The author's reasoning is that they were trying to free up the dryer for others, but the girl's clothes were still in the dryer, possibly because she was using a single item, which takes less time. The author took it out because it was dry, but the note implies the blazer needed more time to de-wrinkle.\n\nThe key points are intent and context. The author's intent was to help others by freeing up the dryer, which led to others' clothes being dried. However, the girl's specific need for the dryer might have been more urgent for her interview. But the author didn't know that. The author's assumption was that the clothes were already dry, which might be reasonable. However, taking someone else's belongings without permission could be seen as a breach of trust or respect.\n\nIn shared spaces, there's an unspoken agreement to respect others' belongings. Even if the dryer was underutilized, removing someone else's clothes could be considered wrong. The author might not be in the wrong if there's a clear rule about it, but without such rules, it's a judgment call. The girl left a note, indicating she felt her rights were violated. The author's action, while well-intentioned, might have overstepped into the girl's personal space.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because they took someone else's clothes without permission, even if they had good intentions. The girl's frustration is valid because her belongings were handled without her consent. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
