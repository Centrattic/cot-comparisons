Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. So, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the dorm has limited dryers. The author found all dryers taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. They took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes. The clothes were already pretty dry, so they took it out and hung it up. Then the girl left a note angry about it because she was using the dryer for her blazer for an interview.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the dryers were all in use, the author took someone else's clothes out, but the clothes were already dry. The girl was upset because she needed the dryer for a blazer. The author's reasoning is that by taking out the dry clothes, they freed up the dryer, which helped reduce the pile of wet clothes. But they didn't know whose clothes they were taking.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally considered wrong. Even if the intention was good, removing items from another person's dryer is an invasion of their property and could cause issues. The girl had a legitimate reason (interview), but the author didn't ask first. However, the author might argue that the situation was an emergency due to limited dryers and they were trying to help.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, respecting others' belongings is important. Even if the dryer was taking too long, taking clothes without permission isn't acceptable. The girl had a specific use for her clothes, and the author's action disrupted that. So, the author probably did something wrong by taking the clothes. However, there's context: the dryers were all full, and the clothes were dry. But still, permission is key here.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (yes), the author is in the wrong because they took someone else's clothes without consent. Even if the intention was to help, it's not their place to decide that. The girl's right to her clothes takes precedence. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n"
