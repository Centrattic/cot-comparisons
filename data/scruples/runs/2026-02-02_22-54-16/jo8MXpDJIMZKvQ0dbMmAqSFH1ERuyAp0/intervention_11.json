Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they took someone else's clothes out of the dryer because all dryers were occupied. The dryer the author used had one item, a blazer, set for 75 minutes. The author took it out after 40 minutes when it was mostly dry, and left a note. The girl was mad because she was using the dryer for her interview blazer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the dorm. If there are specific rules about not taking others' clothes, then the author might be wrong. But the prompt doesn't mention any such rules. The dorm has more washers than dryers (6 vs. 4), which probably leads to contention. The author saw that other people had wet clothes piling up, which might imply a common problem with people hoarding dryers. \n\nThe author's action was to take one item from a dryer that wasn't being used efficiently (only one item in a dryer for 75 minutes). The blazer was already dry, so maybe it's not a big deal. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally considered wrong, even if done with good intentions. The girl was using the dryer for an important purpose (interview blazer), which adds context for her anger. \n\nBut the author's intention was to free up a dryer, which helped others. The question is whether the action itself is wrong regardless of intention. In many situations, unless there's an explicit agreement or rule allowing such actions, taking someone else's belongings without consent is considered inappropriate. Even if the dryer is shared, each person's load is their own. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the dryer was supposed to be used for the full cycle, but the author interrupted it. However, the blazer was already dry, so maybe the full cycle wasn't necessary. Still, the ownership of the clothes is the main issue here. \n\nSo, the key points are: no explicit rules mentioned, the action was to free up a dryer, but taking someone else's clothes without asking is a breach of their property rights. Even if the author had good intentions, the act itself is a violation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
