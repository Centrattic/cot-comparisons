Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is that there were only four dryers in a college dorm, and the author found all of them occupied. They took a girl's clothes out because one dryer was set for 75 minutes and her item was already dry. The girl left a note angry about it, saying it was a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Were there any specific dorm rules about not opening others' clothes in the dryer? The scenario doesn't mention any, so maybe not. But even if there are implied rules, the author's reasoning was that the dryer was underutilized and the clothes were already dry. The girl had one item in a dryer for a long time, which might be seen as taking up a spot when others need it. The author tried to help by freeing up the dryer, leading to others' clothes getting dry as well.\n\nHowever, the act of taking someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of trust and privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, removing someone else's belongings without asking could be seen as trespassing. The girl was upset because it was for an important interview, which adds to her frustration. On the other hand, the author was trying to solve a problem caused by the limited number of dryers and the inefficiency of using one dryer for 75 minutes for a single item.\n\nBut the key here is intent versus consequence. The author didn't have ill intent but still did something that affected someone else. In many shared living situations, people expect their belongings to be left alone unless there's a clear agreement. So even if the author thought they were helping, taking clothes without permission could be considered wrong. Additionally, the note from the girl shows she felt her property was violated, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, while the author's actions were driven by trying to resolve a resource issue, the act itself is a violation of personal boundaries. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But this is a bit of a gray area. However, in most social norms, taking someone else's items without consent is not acceptable, regardless of the reason. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
