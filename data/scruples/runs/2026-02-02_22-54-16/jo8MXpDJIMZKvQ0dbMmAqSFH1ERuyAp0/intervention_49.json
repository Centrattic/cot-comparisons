Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The dorm has more washers than dryers, which leads to a problem. The author noticed all dryers were taken, and there were lots of wet clothes around. The girl in question had one item in the dryer set for 75 minutes. The author took it out after it was relatively dry, 40 minutes later, and hung it up. The girl left a note upset because she was using the dryer for her blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules or norms of the dorm. If there are specific rules about not touching others' laundry, then the author might be wrong. But maybe there are no such rules. The problem is the limited number of dryers causing a bottleneck. The author saw that all dryers were occupied, which led to wet clothes piling up. By taking someone else's item out early, maybe they were trying to free up a dryer for others.\n\nBut is it right to take someone else's clothes without permission? Even if the dryer was overused? If the item was almost dry, maybe the author didn't need it. However, the girl had a specific reason (interview) and was using the dryer for a longer time. The author might have disrupted her plans.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's action helped free up the dryer, which might be necessary when resources are scarce. But did they have the right to do that? If the dryer was hers, even though she wasn't using it efficiently, does she have ownership over it? Maybe the dorm's policy is unclear. If the author had asked, maybe it would have been okay, but taking without permission is a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the author claims that after taking the item out, other piles of wet clothes disappeared. So maybe the action had a positive effect. But the intention was to help, but the action was intrusive. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The author might have good intentions, but taking someone else's property without consent is generally wrong. Unless there's a system in place for shared resources. But in a dorm setting, people usually own their own laundry. So the author is in the wrong for taking the clothes without asking.\n"
