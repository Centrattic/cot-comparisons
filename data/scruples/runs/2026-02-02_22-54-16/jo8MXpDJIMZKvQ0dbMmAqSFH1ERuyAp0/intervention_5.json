Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that there are only four dryers in the dorm, and when they went to use them, all the dryers were taken. The author noticed a girl using a dryer with just one item for 75 minutes. They took it out after 40 minutes when it was already dry, and then the girl left a note saying not to take others' clothes out of an on dryer, because she was using it for her job interview blazer.\n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is that the dryers were scarce, and they were trying to prevent a hold-up by removing an item that was already dry. But the girl was using the dryer for an important reason. On one hand, the author might have a point about the unfair use of a dryer for just one item, but on the other hand, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a bit of a privacy and respect issue. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to take someone else's clothes? Is using a dryer for one item for an extended time considered fair? Also, the consequences\u2014did the author's action actually help others get dryers sooner? The girl was using a dryer for a blazer, which might take longer than regular clothes. But if the dryer was already almost done, maybe taking it out early was necessary. However, without knowing the context, the author made a judgment call. \n\nI think the author's intention was to free up a dryer, but they didn't consider the other person's specific needs. However, in a shared space with limited resources, sometimes people have to make decisions. The girl left the dryer running for a long time, which could be seen as misuse. But taking someone's clothes without asking is also a problem. Maybe there's a middle ground, like asking if they can take it out early if it's dry. But since they didn't ask, maybe the author is at least partially in the wrong. But given the scarcity, maybe it's not entirely their fault. I'm a bit torn here. The note the girl left seems a bit harsh, though. She could have just asked or communicated better. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But they did take action without consent. Hmm.\n"
