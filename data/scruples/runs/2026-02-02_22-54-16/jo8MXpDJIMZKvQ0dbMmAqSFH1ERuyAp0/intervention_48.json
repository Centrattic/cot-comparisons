Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. Here's the situation: the dorm has limited dryers, and the author saw all dryers occupied. There were piles of wet clothes around. The author took a jacket from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, but it was already pretty dry. When the owner came back, she was upset.\n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is that the dryer was taking too long, and they wanted to free it up. They thought their action helped others avoid the same problem. But the other person was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview, which is important. The note from the other person is harsh, but the author didn't know it was someone else's jacket.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally not okay. It's a privacy issue and a matter of respecting others' property. Even if the author had good intentions, they didn't ask first. On the other hand, the situation was a shared space with limited resources. The other person was using a dryer for a long time, which might be seen as inefficient, and the author tried to help by taking the already dry item.\n\nBut the problem is that the author assumed it was okay to take the clothes without asking. Even if the dryer wasn't efficient, they should have either waited or asked the person first. The owner had a legitimate need for the jacket, and the author's action ruined her plans. The note was rude, but the author's action was inconsiderate. So maybe the author is at least partially at fault. However, the situation is a bit ambiguous. The dorm's dryers are a shared resource, so maybe there are informal rules about using them efficiently. But taking someone's clothes without permission is a breach of trust and could lead to conflicts.\n\nIn the end, the author's action was inconsiderate and disrespectful of the other person's property, even if the intention was to help. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
