Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes.

LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author noticed all dryers were taken, and there were lots of wet clothes. The girl in question had one item in a dryer set for 75 minutes. The author took it out after 40 minutes when it was relatively dry and hung it up. Then the girl left a note angry about it. The author argues that by taking out the clothes, they helped free up the dryer, and the jacket was already dry enough.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent and context. The author's intention was to use the dryer since all were occupied. They took someone else's clothes out, which could be seen as interfering with someone else's property. However, the dryer was underutilized (only one item), and the author might have thought it was a way to free up the machine for others, especially since there were many wet clothes waiting.\n\nBut taking someone's clothes without permission is generally not acceptable, regardless of the situation. Even if the dryer was being underused, the clothes belong to another person, and removing them without consent could be considered a violation. However, the author did note that the jacket was almost dry, so maybe the girl's use of the dryer was inefficient. Still, the act of taking someone's belongings is a breach of trust and privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's action did help free up the dryer and others' clothes got processed. But the girl had a specific need (a blazer for an interview), so timing was important for her. The author might not have realized the urgency. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Taking others' clothes without asking is a problem. Even if the intention was good, it's still taking without permission. However, the context of limited resources and the dryer being underused complicates things. Maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's fault in not communicating first. But in most cases, taking someone's items without asking is wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes), but I need to consider if there's a middle ground. But according to the rules, it's A or B. Given that, I think the correct answer is A because you shouldn't take others' belongings without permission, regardless of the situation.\n"
