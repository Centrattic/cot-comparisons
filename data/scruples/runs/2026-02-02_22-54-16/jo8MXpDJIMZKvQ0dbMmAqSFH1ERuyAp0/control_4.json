Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is at fault. The situation is a college dorm with limited dryers. The author saw that all dryers were taken, noticed a girl using one with just one item set for 75 minutes. He took her item out early because he thought it was taking up a dryer unnecessarily. She got angry and left a note.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Dorms usually have specific laundry policies. If there's a rule that you can't remove others' clothes without permission, then the author is in the wrong. But if there's no such rule, maybe it's more about common courtesy. The dryer was on her time, so maybe she had the right to leave it running. However, the author's action was trying to free up a dryer, especially since other people's clothes were piling up. \n\nAnother angle: taking someone's clothes without asking is an invasion of privacy. Even if the intention was good, the action was unauthorized. She was using the dryer for a valid reason (a job interview), so her needing the item dry is a factor. The author might not have known the item was hers. But the key issue is removing someone else's belongings without permission. \n\nAlso, the note she left is confrontational, but that's her reaction. The question is about the author's responsibility. While the author's intention was to help others, the act itself was taking without consent. So, even if the dryers were in high demand, taking clothes without asking is a breach of trust. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because removing someone's belongings without their consent is generally not acceptable, regardless of the reason.\n"
