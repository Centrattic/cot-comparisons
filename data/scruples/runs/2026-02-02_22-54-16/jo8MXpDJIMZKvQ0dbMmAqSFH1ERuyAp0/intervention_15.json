Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The scenario is a college dorm with limited dryers.\n\nFirst, the dryers are in short supply\u20146 washers but only 4 dryers. The author found all dryers occupied, leading to a lot of wet clothes piling up because others aren't using them efficiently. The author took a single item from a dryer that had been set for 75 minutes, which was already dry, to hang it up. Then, when they returned, someone left a note upset about the jacket for an interview.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the dryers are scarce, the author took action to free up a dryer, the item was mostly dry, and the person they took it from was frustrated. \n\nIs it wrong to take someone else's clothes from a dryer? Legally, maybe not, but in terms of social norms. In shared spaces, people usually expect their items to stay in the dryer until done. However, the situation is a bit more complex because the dryers are in high demand and not all users are efficient. The author's action might be seen as a necessary step to free up resources, but it's also respecting others' belongings. \n\nThe note from the person indicates that the jacket was for a job interview, which adds urgency. The author might not have known about the interview, so their action was based on the assumption that the dryer was being misused. But taking someone's clothes without permission, even if well-intentioned, can be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. \n\nHowever, the dryers being underutilized by others (with piles of wet clothes) suggests a systemic issue. The author's action could be justified as helping to free up a dryer that's needed by others. But the problem is that it's not their place to decide who else's clothes to take. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, even if the intention was good, taking someone's clothes without asking is generally frowned upon. People might expect their items to remain in the dryer until the cycle ends. The author could have approached the situation differently, maybe by discussing with the dryer user or the dorm management about the dryer shortage. \n\nOn the other hand, the dryers are shared resources, and if everyone is misusing them, the system is flawed. The author's action might be a symptom of a larger problem in the dorm's laundry management. But personally, the act of taking clothes without permission is a gray area. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they acted to address a resource shortage, but they also didn't seek permission. The other person had a valid reason for being upset because their clothes were taken. However, the dryers being underutilized by others complicates it. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to help, the method was problematic. They should have found a different way to address the dryer issue rather than taking someone else's clothes. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
