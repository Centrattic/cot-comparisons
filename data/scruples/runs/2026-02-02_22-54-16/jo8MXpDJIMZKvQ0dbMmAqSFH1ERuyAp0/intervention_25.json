Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author did the wrong thing by taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author noticed all dryers were taken, with a lot of wet clothes around. A girl had one item in the dryer for 75 minutes. The author took it out because it was relatively dry, then hung it up. Then the girl left a note upset about it. The author argues that they prevented a hold-up, and the clothes around them disappeared after.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The dryers are limited, so there's a shortage. The girl was using a dryer for 75 minutes, which is longer than necessary. The author took her item out because it was dry enough and that freed up the dryer. But the girl was using the dryer for a job interview, which is a time-sensitive situation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of trust. Even if the dryer was overloaded, removing someone else's item could lead to problems if the clothes weren't actually dry yet. The girl's blazer might have needed more time to dry properly for her interview, and the author's action could have ruined it or caused her stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did notice the dryers were all taken and there were piles of wet clothes. By taking the already dry item out, they freed up the dryer for others. The author's intention was to help reduce the backlog. The item was already dry, so maybe it was safe to take. The note the girl left is a bit harsh, but the author didn't know it was for an interview.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: Legally, taking someone's clothes without permission could be seen as theft or trespassing, but in a dorm setting, it's more about etiquette. Ethically, the author tried to solve a problem they saw, but without consulting the owner. The girl had a valid reason to be upset because her clothes were being handled without consent, which is a privacy and trust issue.\n\nSo, while the author's intent was to help, the act itself was without consent, which is problematic. The balance here is between the greater good (freeing up dryers) and respecting individual property. Since the author couldn't be sure if the item was done or not, and the girl's situation was urgent, the author's action might not be the best approach. The correct thing would have been to perhaps ask if the dryer was available or if they could use it, but the author didn't do that. Therefore, the author is somewhat in the wrong because they took someone else's property without permission, even if their intention was good.\n"
