Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dorm has limited dryers\u20146 washers but only 4 dryers. That's a constraint. The author was doing their laundry and found all dryers taken. There were piles of wet clothes around, implying that other people might be holding onto dryers longer than necessary. The author took a single item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes. The item was already pretty dry, so they took it out and hung it up. Then 40 minutes later, the girl left a note complaining about it, saying she was using the dryer for a blazer for a job interview.\n\nSo, the main points here are: limited resources (dryers), the author's action to free up a dryer by taking someone else's clothes, and the justification that the item was already dry. The girl's defense is that she was in a hurry for an important reason.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the dryer was being used for a blazer that needed to be wrinkle-free for an interview, that's a valid reason for her to need it. However, the dryer was set for 75 minutes, and the author took out an item after 40 minutes. If the dryer was only set for 75 minutes and the item was already dry, maybe the author had a reason to take it out, but did they have the right to take someone else's clothes?\n\nOwnership is a factor. The clothes are someone else's, so taking them without permission is generally wrong. Even if the intention was to free up the dryer, the act of removing someone else's belongings without consent is a breach of trust. However, the context of limited resources complicates things. If the dryer was being misused (like leaving a single item in for a long time when there are many people waiting), maybe the author felt justified. But the author only took one item out of a dryer that was being used by someone else. Even if the dryer was only taking one item, the owner might have put multiple items in. Taking one item might not fully free the dryer. Also, the author could have waited or asked if the dryer was available instead of taking action.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that after taking the item, the surrounding piles of wet clothes disappeared. That implies that the action did help others get access to dryers. However, the method used was taking someone else's clothes, which is a violation of their property. The girl's response was to leave a note, which is a bit harsh, but it's a valid complaint because her clothes were taken without permission.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did not ask the owner if they could take the item. They assumed it was okay. Even if the dryer was underutilized, the owner's property was taken. So, from a property rights standpoint, the author is in the wrong. However, the situational context of limited resources and the immediate benefit (freeing up a dryer) could be seen as mitigating factors. But the ethical standard usually is that you shouldn't take someone else's belongings without permission, regardless of the situation. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
