Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is at fault. So the situation is: there are more washers than dryers in the dorm. The author found all dryers taken, with lots of wet clothes around. They took a girl's clothes out of a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, but after 40 minutes, they took them out and hung them up. The girl got mad and left a note about not taking others' clothes from a running dryer, especially since she was using it for a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the laundry room. Typically, in shared spaces, there's an unspoken or written rule about not taking others' clothes without permission. Even if the dryers are limited, taking someone else's load could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have thought they were helping by freeing up a dryer, but the girl was using it for something important. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the clothes were mostly dry. Maybe they thought it was okay because they weren't completely dry yet? However, the girl's note implies that the time was critical for her. If she had to use the dryer for a specific duration for her blazer, taking her clothes early could have ruined her item. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that they were freeing up dryers because others were leaving clothes in them. But taking someone else's clothes without asking is a problem. Even if the dryers were busy, the proper approach might be to wait or ask if the dryer is being used efficiently. \n\nSo, the question is about whether the action of taking clothes without permission is wrong, regardless of the reason. Even if the author had good intentions, the act itself is a breach of trust. The girl had a valid reason, and the author didn't communicate before taking the clothes. \n\nI think the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they took someone else's belongings without consent. Even if the dryers were in high demand, respecting others' property is essential. The girl's irritation is understandable, especially for an important interview. The author should have waited or found another way to handle the situation without interfering with someone else's load.\n"
