Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question took a girl's clothes from the dryer because all the dryers were full and they wanted to free one up. The girl was upset because her blazer was in the dryer for a job interview. \n\nFirst, the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers, which is a limited resource. The author noticed the dryers were all taken and there were a lot of wet clothes around. They took one item (the blazer) that was already dry and hung it up. The girl left a note, implying she was using the dryer for a blazer needed for an interview.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that they were trying to free up a dryer for others. The blazer was already dry, so removing it might have been reasonable. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a line that might not be crossed easily. Even if the clothes were dry, the ownership is an issue. The author didn't know whose clothes they were, so maybe intent matters here. Were they trying to help or take? \n\nThe girl's reaction is justified because someone else's property was taken without consent. Even if the item was dry, removing it without asking is a form of theft. On the other hand, the dorm's situation is a shared space with limited resources, so maybe the author had a valid reason. But the fact remains that removing someone else's belongings is a breach of trust and privacy. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, taking someone's clothes without permission is theft. Ethically, it's about respecting others' property. The author might have had good intentions, but the action itself is problematic. The fact that the blazer was for an interview adds urgency for the girl. So, even if the author thought they were helping, they crossed a line. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
