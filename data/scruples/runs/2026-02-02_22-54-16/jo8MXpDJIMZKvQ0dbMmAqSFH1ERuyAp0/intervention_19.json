Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they took a girl's clothes out of the dryer because all the dryers were taken. The girl was upset about it. \n\nFirst, the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author found all dryers occupied, so their clothes were stuck. They noticed a pile of wet clothes around, implying others might be using dryers inefficiently. The girl had one item in the dryer for 75 minutes, which the author took out after 40 minutes because it was already dry. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were trying to free up a dryer, which would help with the overall wait time. But the girl was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview, which is important. The note the girl left was pretty harsh, making it clear she wanted her clothes to be dewrinkled properly. \n\nNow, the key points: Did the author have the right to take someone else's clothes? In a shared space like a dorm, there's usually an understanding not to touch others' belongings. Even if the dryer was underused, taking someone's clothes without permission is a privacy issue. The author might not have known it was the blazer, but using the dryer beyond the time needed isn't the author's responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the dryers being scarce does create a problem. The author's action, while maybe well-intentioned, could be seen as overstepping. The girl's frustration is understandable because her specific need (a professional interview) is more time-sensitive. \n\nBut the author claims that after taking the clothes out, the dryer was freed up, which allowed others' clothes to be dried. However, the main issue is the act of taking someone else's clothes without consent. Even if the intention was to help, it's a violation of privacy and trust. \n\nSo, while the situation is understandable, the act itself was inappropriate. The author should have waited or communicated rather than taking the clothes. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
