Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The author's reasoning is that all dryers were occupied and they only took one item, which was already mostly dry. The other person was upset because they were using the dryer for a job interview blazer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the dorm. If there's a rule against using dryers for only one item or against interrupting others' drying cycles, that's a factor. But the author didn't mention any specific rules, so maybe there aren't any strict policies here.\n\nThen, the practical aspect: the dryers are limited (6 washers, 4 dryers), which is a common issue in dorms. The author tried to free up a dryer by taking out their clothes early. However, the other person was using one dryer for an extended time (75 minutes) for a single item. That seems inefficient. If the author had left their item in the dryer for the full cycle, it might have been a problem, but since they took it out early and the clothes were mostly dry, maybe it's a minor issue.\n\nThe main conflict is about sharing resources. The author tried to help by not letting the dryer sit idle with just one item. But the other person's need for a blazer might be urgent. However, using the dryer for 75 minutes for one item could be seen as taking up space unnecessarily. If others are waiting, using one dryer for so long isn't fair. The author might have a point in trying to free up the machine, but taking someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of trust and could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the author's action was to take their own clothes out early, not someone else's. Wait, no\u2014the blazer was the other person's. The author took the other person's clothes out of the dryer. That's a different scenario. So the author took someone else's clothes, not their own. That's a big mistake. Even if the dryer was underused, taking someone else's property without permission is wrong. The author should have waited or asked instead of taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo, even though the dryers are limited and the other person's use seems excessive, the act of taking someone else's clothes without consent is the main issue here. The author could have waited or communicated better. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
