Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is at a college dorm with limited dryers. The author saw all dryers were taken, with many wet clothes around. They took a nearly dried item from a dryer where someone else was using it for a long time, hung it up, and then later got a note from the owner who was preparing for a job interview.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the scarcity of dryers versus washers. The dryers are a bottleneck, and the author is trying to alleviate the problem. The other person had only one item in the dryer for 75 minutes, which might be excessive. The author took it out because it was already dry, and this action helped clear up the dryers for others.\n\nBut the question is about right or wrong. Legally, taking someone else's clothes isn't theft since they're drying them, but morally? The owner's note mentions a job interview, which adds urgency. The author didn't ask first, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the dryers were in high demand, and the author's action might have been a reasonable way to free up a resource.\n\nOn one hand, the author acted to help themselves and possibly others by removing an item that was already dry. On the other, they didn't check with the owner, which could be a breach of trust. The owner might have had specific reasons for the long drying time, like the blazer needing extra care. If the blazer was ruined, the author would definitely be at fault. But the blazer was already dry and looked fine, so maybe the damage was minimal.\n\nIn dorm settings, communal appliances often have rules. If there are no posted rules, it's hard to say. But generally, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a gray area. The author might have acted out of necessity, but the better approach would have been to ask first or leave a note. However, since the clothes were already dry and the action helped free up a dryer, it's debatable. The answer might hinge on whether the author should have checked first, which they didn't. But considering the scarcity of dryers, maybe they're not entirely wrong.\n"
