Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is a college dorm with limited dryers. The author took a girl's clothes out of the dryer because all the dryers were full, and her item was already dry. The girl left a note saying not to do that, and the author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and norms in a shared laundry setting. Dorms usually have specific guidelines about using shared appliances. Taking someone else's clothes without permission could be seen as violating those norms. Even if the dryer was full, removing another person's items might be considered rude or inconsiderate, especially if they were waiting for their clothes to finish.\n\nThe author mentions that the girl was using one dryer for 75 minutes with just one item, which took 40 minutes. That seems excessive, and the author might have felt justified in taking it out since it was already dry. However, the key point is whether the author had the right to take the clothes. Even if the dryer was underutilized, removing someone else's belongings without consent is problematic. \n\nAlso, the girl was using the dryer for a job interview blazer, which might have been important to her. The author's action could have caused her stress or inconvenience. While the author's intention was to free up the dryer, respecting others' property and waiting their turn is important. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be at fault for taking the clothes without permission. Even if the situation was frustrating, there might be other solutions like waiting or communicating with the girl. The dorm might have rules about this, so the author should check those. If there's no rule against it, it's still a matter of common courtesy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because taking someone else's clothes without asking is a breach of trust and respect. Even if the dryer was scarce, the proper approach would be to wait or talk to the person first.\n"
