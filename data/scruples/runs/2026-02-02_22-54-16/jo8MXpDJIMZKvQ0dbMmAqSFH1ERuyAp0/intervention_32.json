Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they took a girl's clothes out of the dryer when all the dryers were taken. The girl was upset because she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview. The dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers, which is a problem.\n\nThe user says they noticed all dryers were taken and there were lots of wet clothes around. They took the one item that was in a dryer, which was relatively dry, hung it up, and then the girl left a note. The author is asking if they're at fault. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dryers are limited, so there's a scarcity. The author saw that all dryers were occupied and there were piles of wet clothes. They took the one item that was already dry, maybe to free up the dryer for others. But the girl was using it for an important reason\u2014interview blazer. \n\nIs there a rule about not taking others' clothes from the dryer? The author didn't know it was hers. If there's no explicit rule against it, maybe it's a judgment call. But even without rules, taking someone else's belongings could be seen as violating their trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to help by not letting the dryers be monopolized. The jacket was already dry, so maybe it's less of a problem. But the girl's frustration is valid because she needed her blazer for an interview. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they took someone else's property without permission. However, their intent was to free up the dryer for others. But even with good intentions, taking someone's belongings without asking could be considered wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the dryer was only set for a short time and the clothes were already dry, maybe the author had a reasonable belief that it was okay. But the fact that they took it without knowing who it was could be an issue. \n\nHmm. I think the key points are intent, the rules of the dorm, and the impact. If there's no rule against it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if taking others' clothes is against the dorm's norms, even implicitly, then they might be. The girl was upset, so maybe the author should have checked first. \n\nGiven that the author didn't know whose clothes they were and acted to help others, but still took someone else's property, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
