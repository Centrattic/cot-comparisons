Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of a dryer. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the dorm has 6 washers and 4 dryers. The author notices all dryers are taken, with lots of wet clothes around. They find a dryer with one item (a jacket) set for 75 minutes. The jacket was already pretty dry, so the author takes it out and hangs it up. Later, the owner leaves a note about the jacket being for an interview and the author's action being a hot tip.\n\nNow, considering the rules and common courtesy. The author didn't own the clothes, but the dryer was on and the clothes were in the way. However, taking someone else's clothes, even if they're not yours, is a privacy and property issue. Even if the dryer was overfilled, the author could have waited their turn instead of taking someone else's items. The fact that the dryer was reserved for one item doesn't justify taking it without permission. The author's action disrupted the owner's planned use for the blazer, which was important for an interview. While the author might have been trying to help by freeing up the dryer, the right approach would have been to politely ask if they could use the dryer or wait. Taking without permission, even with good intentions, is a breach of trust and respect. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't have the right to take someone else's belongings, regardless of the circumstances.\n"
