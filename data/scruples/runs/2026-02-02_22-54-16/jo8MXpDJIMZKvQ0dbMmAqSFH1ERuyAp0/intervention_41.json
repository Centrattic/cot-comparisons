Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is in a college dorm with a limited number of dryers\u2014six washers but only four dryers. They found all dryers occupied, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. They took one item from a dryer that had been running for 75 minutes, which they thought was just a single item. The clothes were relatively dry, so they hung them up. Later, a note from the girl says not to take her clothes out of the dryer, and she was using it for a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether taking someone's clothes from a shared dryer without permission is wrong. Shared laundry facilities usually require users to claim their items by placing a basket or marker, or some dorms have specific rules. If the person didn't check if the clothes were truly unclaimed, they might be at fault. The note implies the dryer was hers, and she was using it for an important purpose. However, she only had one item in the dryer, which is unusual. People typically use dryers for multiple items to be efficient, especially in a dorm with limited machines. The author might have assumed the single item was unclaimed, given the context of other people leaving clothes unattended. \n\nAlso, the author tried to free up the dryer to help others, and by the time the note was left, many clothes had been taken, so maybe the girl's blazer wasn't as urgent anymore. But the blazer was for an interview, which is a time-sensitive need. The author didn't know about the interview, so maybe they had no way of knowing the importance. However, the act of taking someone else's clothes is a breach of trust and could lead to conflicts. Even if the clothes were dry, removing them without permission is still taking what doesn't belong to them. \n\nThe girl's reaction is understandable because she might have been relying on that dryer for her interview. But the author's intention was to resolve the scarcity of dryers. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Since the author didn't own the clothes, even if they were unattended and the dryer was underused, taking them without asking is wrong. The proper action would be to ask the person using the dryer if they could use it, but if they didn't, then taking without permission is a problem. The answer might depend on dorm rules, but generally, shared spaces require respecting others' belongings. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
