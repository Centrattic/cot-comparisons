Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person took someone else's clothes from the dryer. The key points here are ownership and intent. They noticed all dryers were full and took a partially dried item, which they thought was their own or just needed a bit more time. The other person was using it for a job interview, which is a valid reason. But taking someone's clothes without permission, even if it's a shared space, is probably a no-go. The dorm rules might not explicitly cover this, but it's a matter of respect. The person could have asked if they needed to borrow the dryer, but instead they took it. So the author is at least partially in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
