Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author was doing laundry and found all dryers occupied. There were a lot of wet clothes around, implying that people were using the dryers inefficiently. The author took their clothes from the washer, and when they noticed all dryers were taken, they noticed a girl with one item in a dryer set for 75 minutes. The author decided to take that item out after it was \"relatively dry\" and hung it up. Later, the girl left a note angry about it, saying she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nThe question is whether the author did something wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the dryers are a limited resource. If the girl had one item in a dryer for 75 minutes, that's a long time for a single item. The author might have thought that using the dryer for a longer time on one item was inefficient, especially when others were waiting. If the item was already dry enough, maybe the author saw an opportunity to free up the dryer for others.\n\nOn the other hand, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a clear violation of their property. The girl had a right to her clothes, and the author took them without asking. Even if the dryer was being misused, it's not the author's place to intervene that way. The girl could have been upset because she was in a hurry for an interview, and the author disrupted her plans.\n\nBut the dorm's situation is that there's a scarcity of dryers. If everyone is using them inefficiently, it's causing a problem. The author might have felt that helping to free up the dryer was the right thing to do, especially if the clothes were already dry. However, even in a shared space, respecting others' belongings is important. The author could have approached the girl and asked if they could take the clothes, but taking them without permission might still be seen as wrong, even with good intentions.\n\nAnother angle: the author noticed that the girl left the clothes in the dryer too long, which caused a backlog. But taking someone else's belongings without consent is a privacy and respect issue. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to be helpful, but they did take an action that the girl didn't agree with, causing her distress. The note was probably meant to be confrontational, but the author's action might have been a necessary evil in a situation of resource scarcity.\n\nIn summary, while the author had good intentions to alleviate the dryer shortage, taking the girl's clothes without her consent is a violation of her property rights. Even if the dryer was being misused, the appropriate action would have been to ask if she needed help or if she wanted to shorten the cycle. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
