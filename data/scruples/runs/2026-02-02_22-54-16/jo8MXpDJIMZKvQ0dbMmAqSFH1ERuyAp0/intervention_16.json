Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking someone else's clothes from a dryer. The author's dorm has limited dryers, and when they came back, they found a girl's clothes in a dryer set for 75 minutes. They took it out after about 40 minutes when it was already dry, thinking they were helping clear up the dryer situation. The girl left a note angry about it.\n\nFirst, the key points: The dryers are in high demand, the clothes were left in the dryer for a long time, and the author took them out to free up the dryer. The girl was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview. The author claims that after taking the clothes out, other wet clothes disappeared, meaning more people could use the dryers.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally not acceptable. Even if the author thought they were helping, it's an invasion of privacy and property. The girl had every right to be upset because her clothes were taken without consent. The fact that the dryer was underutilized (only one item) might be a point, but the author didn't check if the clothes were hers. Also, the note mentions a blazer for an interview, which implies it's important, and the author might have disrupted that without knowing the full context.\n\nOn the other hand, the dryers are a limited resource, and the author's intention was to help. But the main issue is whether taking someone else's belongings is justified. Even if the dryer was being misused, the proper action would be to report it or check with the owner, not take matters into their own hands. So, while the situation is understandable, the act of taking the clothes without permission is likely the author's fault. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
