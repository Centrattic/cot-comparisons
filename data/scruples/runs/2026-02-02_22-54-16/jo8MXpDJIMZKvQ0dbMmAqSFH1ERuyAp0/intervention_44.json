Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The scenario is that there are limited dryers in a college dorm, all four were taken, and the author took a girl's clothes out because they were already dry. The girl got angry and left a note.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't wrong and wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author noticed all dryers were occupied, and there were piles of wet clothes. They took a single item that was already dry, hung it up. Then the girl was upset because she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview. \n\nThe key points here are: the dryers were in high demand, the clothes were already dry, and the author's action freed up the dryer. But taking someone else's clothes is a violation of their property, even if the intent was good. \n\nHowever, in shared facilities, there's often an unspoken understanding that if clothes are dry, you can take them. The author might have thought that since the dryer was on for 75 minutes and the clothes were dry, it was okay. But the girl's note suggests she was waiting for the blazer to dry. \n\nLegally, taking someone else's clothes without permission is wrong. Ethically, maybe there's some leniency if the clothes were dry, but the main issue is respecting others' property. The author didn't ask for permission, so even if the clothes were dry, taking them is a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's action did help free up a dryer, which might have been necessary for others. But that doesn't justify taking the clothes. The girl's frustration is understandable because she needed her blazer for an interview. \n\nIn summary, while the situation shows a lack of dryers causing tension, the author still took another person's property without consent. So, the answer would be A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
