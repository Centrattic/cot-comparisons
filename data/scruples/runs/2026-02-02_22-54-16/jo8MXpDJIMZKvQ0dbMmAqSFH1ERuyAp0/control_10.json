Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is that there are more washers than dryers in the dorm. The author found all dryers taken, with lots of wet clothes around. They took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, which was already relatively dry. Then the girl left a note saying not to take others' clothes out. The author argues that they intervened to prevent a hold-up and that the jacket was almost dry.\n\nHmm, so the key points here. The dryers are a limited resource (6 washers, 4 dryers), which is a common issue in dorms. The author saw that there were a lot of wet clothes, implying that others might be using the dryers inefficiently. They took one item because it was already dry. The other person was using a dryer for a blazer intended for an interview, which is urgent. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't ask before taking the clothes. Even if the dryer was underutilized, taking someone else's items without permission is generally considered rude or wrong. The note from the girl indicates she was upset, and the author's action might have caused her to miss drying her blazer properly. Even if the author's intention was to free up the dryer, the action itself was invasive. \n\nOn the other hand, the dorm's limited resources might make it a shared problem. If others are leaving clothes to dry unnecessarily, that's their fault too. But the author's solution was to take someone else's clothes without consent. That's a breach of trust and privacy. Even if the jacket was mostly dry, removing someone else's belongings from their dryer is a clear violation. \n\nSo, while the dorm situation is a contributing factor, the author's action was unauthorized. They could have waited, maybe offered to share the dryer, or used another method. Taking the clothes without asking is inconsiderate and potentially damaging. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
