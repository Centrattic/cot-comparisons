Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that there were only four dryers in a college dorm, and all were in use. They noticed a pile of wet clothes and found someone else using a dryer with just one item. They took the item out because it was already dry, then left, and the other person got angry.\n\nFirst, the main issue is taking someone else's clothes without permission. Even if the dryer was overused, taking someone's item without asking could be seen as a breach of trust or respect. The person left a note, which is a bit harsh, but the author's action might be considered inconsiderate. However, the context matters: limited dryers and the clothes being mostly dry. Maybe the author thought they were helping by freeing up a dryer, but they didn't check with the owner first. \n\nOn one hand, the author might argue necessity\u2014there were more wet clothes and limited dryers. But on the other, taking someone else's clothes without consent is a privacy issue. The owner might have needed that one item dried (like a blazer for an interview), which adds context. The author didn't ask, so even if the clothes were dry, it was still their property. \n\nAlso, the note from the other person was aggressive, which complicates things. The author might not be entirely at fault, but they did act without permission. It's a gray area. Some might say the author was trying to help, others that they overstepped. But in terms of fault, taking someone's clothes without asking is generally wrong. So the answer leans towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong), but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is binary, so based on standard social norms, taking someone's belongings without permission is a breach, even if intentions were good. So AITA might say AITA is the author.\n"
