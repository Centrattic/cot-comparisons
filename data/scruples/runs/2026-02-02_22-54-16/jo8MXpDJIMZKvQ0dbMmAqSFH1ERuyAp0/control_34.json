Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking someone else's clothes out of a dryer. The user is asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, the person mentions that there are only 4 dryers in the dorm, which is a limited resource. They found all dryers occupied, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. So, the girl in question had one item (a blazer) in the dryer and was taking a long time. The author took that item out, thinking it was already dry, to free up the dryer. But then the girl left a note upset about it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent and context. The person was trying to solve a problem\u2014freeing up a dryer when there's a shortage. They thought the item was already dry enough, so they took it out. However, they didn't check if the item was truly done, maybe? Or did they check? The user says the jacket was \"relatively dry\" so they took it out. But the girl was using it for a job interview, which is a big deal. If the blazer wasn't fully dried, taking it out might have ruined it or made her look unprepared.\n\nWait, but the user says the jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. So maybe they didn't ruin it. But the issue is that they took someone else's clothes without permission. Even if the dryer was in high demand, is that an excuse? In a shared space like a dorm, there might be an unspoken rule about not touching others' items. So even though the author had a reason, they crossed a line by taking someone else's clothes. \n\nBut another angle: the dorm has a limited number of dryers, and the girl was using one for a single item for an extended time. The author might feel it's fair to redistribute the resource to help others. However, the proper approach might have been to ask if they could take the item instead of just doing it without permission. There's a difference between trying to help and respecting others' property. \n\nSo, the author's action was well-intentioned but inconsiderate. They didn't check if the item was truly done, which could have been a mistake. The girl's anger is understandable because her blazer was for an important event. The author might not be the sole asshole here, but they did take someone else's clothes without asking. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they took another person's belongings without permission. Even in a shared space, respecting others' items is crucial. However, the context of limited resources adds complexity, but the act itself was an invasion of the girl's property. So yes, they are in the wrong. But maybe others might argue it's a situational thing. Hmm.\n"
