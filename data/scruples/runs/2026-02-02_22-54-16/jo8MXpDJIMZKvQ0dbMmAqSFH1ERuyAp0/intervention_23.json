Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is that there were more washers than dryers, and the person noticed all dryers were taken. There were a lot of wet clothes around, including this girl's jacket. The person took the jacket out because it was almost dry and hung it up. Then came back to find a note from the girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the dorm. If there's no explicit rule against taking others' clothes, maybe the person didn't know. But even if there's no rule, it's a communal space, so maybe there's an unspoken understanding not to interfere. The person's reasoning is that they were trying to free up a dryer, but they took someone else's item. That's a problem because even if the dryer was inefficient, removing someone else's clothes without permission is a privacy issue. Also, the girl was using the dryer for an important purpose (job interview jacket), so she might have had a time-sensitive need. The person's action might have disrupted her plans. Even if the jacket was mostly dry, taking it without asking was a breach of trust. So while the person's intention was to help, the action itself was wrong. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
