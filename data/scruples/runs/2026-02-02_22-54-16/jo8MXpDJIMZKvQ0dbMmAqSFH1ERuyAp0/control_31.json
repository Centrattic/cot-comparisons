Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is at fault. The situation is in a dorm with limited dryers. The author found all dryers full, noticed other people's wet clothes piling up, and took a single item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes but already dry.\n\nFirst, the dryers are a shared resource. The girl in question had one item in a dryer, which might be inefficient. The author took the item out since it was dry, possibly to free up the dryer for others. But leaving a note about it shows she was upset, especially since she needed the jacket for an interview.\n\nOn one hand, taking someone's clothes without permission is a privacy and ownership issue. Even if the dryer was underutilized, removing someone's belongings without consent is a breach of trust. The fact that there were many other people's clothes around might indicate a common problem, but that doesn't justify taking someone else's items. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been trying to help by freeing up a dryer when there was a shortage. However, the right approach might have been to ask if they could take the item instead of taking it without permission. The girl's note suggests she felt disrespected, which is a valid concern. \n\nConsidering the context, the author acted out of frustration but did so without respecting the other person's property. Even if the dryer wasn't being used efficiently, the solution should involve communication, not unilateral action. So, the author is likely at fault for taking the clothes without asking.\n"
