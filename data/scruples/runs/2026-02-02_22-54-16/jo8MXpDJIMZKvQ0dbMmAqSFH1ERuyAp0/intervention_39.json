Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking someone else's clothes from the dryer. So, the author is in a college dorm with limited dryers\u2014only four. They noticed all dryers were taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. The author took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes but had already been going for 40 minutes. The clothes were pretty dry, so they took them out. The other person left a note angry about it, saying they were using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Are there any dorm policies about this? The author didn't mention any, so maybe there aren't explicit rules. But generally, taking someone else's items without permission is a no-no. However, the context is important here. The dryers are scarce, and there's a backlog of wet clothes. The author intervened to free up a dryer, which helped others. The clothes they took were already mostly dry. \n\nThe other person had one item in the dryer for 75 minutes. If the clothes are still wet after that time, maybe they need more drying time, but the author took them out early. The blazer is for an interview, which is a legitimate reason, but taking out another person's clothes without asking is a problem. The author might have acted out of necessity but without considering the other person's specific situation. \n\nIs there a balance between communal resources and individual rights? The author tried to free up a dryer, which could be seen as helpful. But taking someone else's clothes is still a violation of their property. Even if the clothes were almost dry, the owner might need them for an important reason. \n\nSo, the author's action was considerate towards the overall situation but inconsiderate towards the individual. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say the author did the right thing by helping others, others might say they shouldn't take others' belongings. But in terms of direct wrongdoing, taking someone's clothes without permission is generally wrong, regardless of the reason. However, the intention was to help reduce the backlog, which could mitigate the blame. \n\nI think the answer might depend on whether there's a policy against this, but since there isn't, it's more about social norms. In a shared space with limited resources, people might have different expectations. The author might be in the wrong for taking the clothes, but their reasoning is understandable. The other person's anger is also valid because their own needs were impacted. It's a tricky situation where both sides have points. But strictly speaking, taking someone else's property without consent is usually considered wrong, so the answer might be A. But if the action was justified by the greater good, maybe it's B. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here.\n"
