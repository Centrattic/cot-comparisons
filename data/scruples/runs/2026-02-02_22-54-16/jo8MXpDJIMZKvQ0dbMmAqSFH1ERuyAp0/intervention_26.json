Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is in a college dorm with limited dryers. The author saw all dryers occupied and others had wet clothes piling up. They took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, hung it up, and later the owner left a note.\n\nFirst, I need to consider dorm rules and common etiquette. Usually, dorms have laundry facilities, and there might be specific rules about taking others' clothes. If there's no rule against it, maybe it's a judgment call. The author probably thought they were being helpful by freeing up a dryer. The jacket was already dry, so maybe the owner was exaggerating the time left. But the owner was upset because it was for an interview, which is important. \n\nOn one hand, taking someone's clothes without permission is a breach of trust and can be seen as rude. Even if the clothes were dry, it's still their property. On the other hand, there was a shortage of dryers, and the author's action might have helped others get their laundry done. The note seems harsh, especially with the \"LOVE, A PERSON...\" part, which is sarcastic. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the dorm doesn't have a strict policy, it's more about social norms. Intervening without asking might be considered wrong because it's not their clothes to take. However, the context of shared resources and the owner's possible negligence in leaving clothes unattended could mitigate some blame. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but there's a conflict between the intention to help and the action of taking clothes. I need to decide if the action justifies the outcome. Maybe the author should have checked first, but in a busy dorm, that might not be feasible. Still, taking clothes without permission is a common issue. So, likely the answer is A (in the wrong) because it's generally not acceptable to take others' items without consent, even if the intention was good.\n"
