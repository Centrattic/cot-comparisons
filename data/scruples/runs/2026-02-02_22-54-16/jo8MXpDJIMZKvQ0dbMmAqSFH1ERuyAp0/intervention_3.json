Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is in a college dorm with limited dryers. The author found all dryers occupied, noticed other people's wet clothes around, and took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes. The clothes were relatively dry, so they hung it up. Later, a girl left a note angry about it, saying she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to weigh both sides. The dorm has only 4 dryers for 6 washers, which is a common issue in shared spaces. The author saw the dryers all taken and maybe felt frustrated, so they took out an item that was mostly dry. The other person was using one dryer for a single item, which could be seen as inefficient. But taking someone else's clothes without their knowledge might be considered a violation of their property and privacy. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a right to take the clothes? The note implies that the dryer was in use for her blazer, which is important for an interview. However, the author's action was to free up a dryer that was underutilized (only one item). The dorm's rules might matter here, but the user didn't mention any specific policies. \n\nIn shared laundry rooms, it's generally understood that people should use machines efficiently. If someone is using a dryer for one item when others are waiting, it's common to take that item out once it's dry. The author didn't know it was the blazer, so intent might be a factor. But the problem is that the author took an item that wasn't theirs, even if it was mostly dry. \n\nThe other person was upset because she needed the dryer for an interview, which is a valid concern. However, the author's action might have been a reasonable solution to a common problem. The note is a bit harsh, but the situation is subjective. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to be considerate and free up a resource that was being underused. The other person should have communicated if she needed more time or if others should leave their clothes. But there's a gray area here. Maybe the author should have checked if the dryer was in use by someone else, but given the context, it's understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
