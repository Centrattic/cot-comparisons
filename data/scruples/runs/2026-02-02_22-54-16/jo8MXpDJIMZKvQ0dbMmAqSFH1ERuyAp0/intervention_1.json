Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is in the wrong. The scenario is in a college dorm with a limited number of dryers. The author noticed all dryers were taken, so they took a single item from another person's dryer after it had been running for 75 minutes and seemed dry. The other person left a note angry about it, mentioning she was using it for a blazer for an interview. The author argues that the dryer was underutilized and that their action helped others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dryers are a limited resource (6 washers, 4 dryers), which might lead to competition. The author saw a dryer with only one item and took it out, which could be seen as a way to free up the dryer for others. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a direct violation of their personal property, regardless of the reasoning. Even if the dryer wasn't full, the person had the right to use their own clothes. The author didn't ask for permission, which is a key point here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought they were helping by not letting the dryer sit idle, especially since others were waiting. But respecting others' belongings is generally a higher priority than optimizing resource use. The note from the other person is quite confrontational, indicating she felt her needs were being prioritized. The author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, still crossed a line. \n\nThe blazer was for an interview, which adds urgency, but the author didn't know that at the time. However, taking without asking is a breach of trust and could lead to conflict. Even if the clothes were dry, the act of taking them without consent is the issue. \n\nSo, balancing these factors: the author's action was a breach of respecting another's property, which is a social norm. Therefore, they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
