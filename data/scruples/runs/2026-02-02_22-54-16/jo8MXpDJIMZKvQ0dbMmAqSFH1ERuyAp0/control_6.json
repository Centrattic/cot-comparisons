Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that they had to wait because the dryers are limited, and they saw a girl with just one item in a dryer that had been running for 75 minutes. They took it out since it was mostly dry, but she got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. In a shared laundry room, is there an unspoken rule about not touching others' clothes? Usually, people are expected to only handle their own. Even if someone's dryer is taking too long, taking it out without permission might be a breach of trust. The person might have been using the dryer for a specific reason, like the blazer for an interview, which is important.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that the dryer was underutilized, so they helped by freeing it up. But the key point here is consent. Even if the dryer was being used inefficiently, removing someone else's clothes without asking is a privacy issue. The owner might have wanted to leave it in longer for better results. Also, the note she left was confrontational, which might have made the situation worse, but that's her response, not the initial action.\n\nAnother angle is the practicality. The user was trying to solve a problem (waiting for dryers) by intervening. However, the right solution might have been to talk to her first or maybe use a different dryer if available. Since there were 6 washers but only 4 dryers, maybe there's a system or a way to rotate usage, but the user didn't mention checking that.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the user acted out of necessity but without permission. The other person's right to their clothes in the dryer is violated. Even if the item was dry, the user didn't have the right to remove it. Therefore, the user is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
