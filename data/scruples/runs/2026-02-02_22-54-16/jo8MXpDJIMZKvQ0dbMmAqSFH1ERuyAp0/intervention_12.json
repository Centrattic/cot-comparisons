Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they took someone else's clothes out of a dryer early because all the dryers were full, and the other person was upset.\n\nFirst, the context: the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author saw all dryers taken and other people's wet clothes around, implying a shortage. The author took a single item from someone else's dryer, which was set for 75 minutes but already dry. The person left a note angry about it, saying they were using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nSo, the key points here. Did the author have a valid reason? They were trying to free up a dryer because there was a shortage, and the clothes were already dry. The other person's dryer was taking longer, but maybe they could have waited or communicated. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a boundary issue. Even if the clothes were dry, removing them from the dryer might have been an overstep. The other person might have a right to be upset because their property was taken without consent. But on the other hand, the author's action might have helped free up a dryer, which others needed. \n\nBut then again, the author could have done a few things differently. Maybe they could have asked if the dryer could be used earlier, or waited their turn, or hung up their own clothes. Alternatively, maybe the other person was using the dryer for a short time, but the author assumed it was taking too long. The note suggests the blazer was in for 75 minutes, but maybe it wasn't done yet. However, the author says it was \"relatively dry,\" so maybe it was okay. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, taking someone else's property without permission is theft, but in a dorm setting, it's more about social norms. Socially, people might not appreciate others handling their belongings without asking. Even if the clothes were dry, removing them from the dryer could be seen as interfering. The author might argue it was a necessary action due to the dryer shortage. However, the other person's note implies they were stressed about an interview, which could add weight to their perspective. \n\nBut the author's intention was to free up the dryer, which others might have needed. However, the solution was to take someone else's clothes, which might not be the best approach. Maybe the author should have handled it differently, like waiting or talking to the person first. Still, considering the situation of limited dryers, the author's action might be seen as a pragmatic choice. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to solve a problem, but they also didn't ask permission. The other person's reaction is valid because their property was taken without consent. So, it's a bit of a both situation, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer leans towards the author being somewhat in the wrong because they took another person's clothes without asking. Even if the intent was good, the action was unauthorized. However, the circumstances (limited dryers) might mitigate some of the blame. But in a community setting like a dorm, respecting others' belongings is important. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong, but the situation is complicated. However, the user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm. Considering all factors, I might lean towards answer A (in the wrong) because taking someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of trust and property rights, even if done with good intentions.\n"
