Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes out of a dryer is at fault. The scenario is in a college dorm with limited dryers. The author saw all dryers taken and other people's wet clothes around. They took a single item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, removed it after 40 minutes when it was mostly dry. The other person left a note about needing the dryer for a blazer for a job interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the laundry room. If there's no rule against removing others' clothes, then maybe the author isn't at fault. But if there is an implicit or explicit rule against that, then they might be wrong. \n\nThe dorm has more washers than dryers, leading to a bottleneck. The author mentions that after removing the item, other piles of clothes disappeared. So maybe the action helped others get their dryers. But the other person's blazer was for a job interview, which is a valid reason. However, the blazer was only 40 minutes in, and it was still drying. Taking it out might have helped the author's own laundry but caused a problem for someone else.\n\nIntentions matter. The author's intent was to free up the dryer, which could be seen as a good deed. But the action itself is taking someone else's property without permission. Even if the clothes were dry, removing them without asking is a boundary issue. The other person might have planned to leave it longer for better drying or pressing.\n\nAlso, the author could have asked first, but maybe there was no opportunity. However, in a shared space, respecting others' items is important. Even in a hurry, taking without permission might be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not be the worst, but there's a case for both sides. The key is whether it's the author's fault. \n\nLegally, you can't take someone else's property, but in a dorm setting, the rules aren't always clear. However, socially, it's about respect. Even if the clothes were mostly dry, the act of taking them without asking is problematic. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but the user thinks the opposite. Need to weigh the social norms versus the practicality of the situation.\n"
