Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The scenario is that there are only 4 dryers in the dorm, and when the author went to check their laundry, all dryers were occupied. The author noticed a girl's clothes in one dryer that was set for 75 minutes but already dry. They took the clothes out, hung them up, and then the girl left a harsh note.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. The dorm probably has some laundry policies. If there's a rule against taking others' clothes from the dryer without permission, then the author is in the wrong. But if there's no such rule, maybe the author isn't. However, even without explicit rules, there's an unspoken social norm of not interfering with others' belongings. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were trying to free up a dryer by removing clothes that were already dry. They mention that after doing this, other people's wet clothes disappeared, implying more people got their dryers. But the girl was upset because her blazer was being dried for an interview. She might have needed the full cycle for the blazer to dry properly or to avoid wrinkles.\n\nFrom a social perspective, taking someone else's clothes without asking is a breach of trust. Even if the author's intention was to help, it's their property. The girl had the right to expect her clothes would stay in the dryer until she retrieved them. The author might have acted out of frustration due to limited resources, but that doesn't justify taking someone else's belongings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the dryer was being misused (only one item in a dryer for 75 minutes), which is inefficient. However, that's a different issue. The problem arises when the author took the clothes without consent. Even if the clothes were dry, removing them without permission is disrespectful and could cause damage, like wrinkles if hung up improperly. \n\nThe note from the girl is confrontational, which might indicate she's upset, but that doesn't mean the author is right. The author's action caused her distress, which is significant because it's for an important event. The author could have either waited or asked if she needed more time instead of taking the clothes. \n\nIn summary, while the author had a valid reason to want a dryer, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a violation of personal property and trust. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
