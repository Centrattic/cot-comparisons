Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person took someone else's clothes from the dryer because all dryers were full. They noticed the dryer was only set for 75 minutes, and the clothes were mostly dry. They took them out to free up a dryer.\n\nThe other person was upset, saying the note was about not taking others' clothes from a running dryer. But the author argues that their action helped others' clothes dry faster, and the jacket was already dry.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, there's a conflict between individual needs and communal resources. Taking someone's clothes without permission is generally not okay. Even if the other person was using the dryer inefficiently, the author didn't own the clothes. The note from the other person indicates they were using the dryer for something important, a job interview blazer. The blazer might need more drying time, and removing it could have ruined it or caused wrinkles.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that they were helping by freeing up the dryer isn't valid because they took someone else's clothes without consent. Even if there were piles of wet clothes, their solution was to take another's clothes, which is a personal choice. The correct action would have been to wait their turn, not to take someone else's belongings. So, the author overstepped by removing the clothes, regardless of intent. They should have waited or asked if the dryer was in use. Taking it without permission is a breach of trust and property rights, even if the intention was to help.\n"
