Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is in a college dorm with limited dryers. The author saw that all dryers were taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. One dryer had just one item, set for 75 minutes, and it was already relatively dry. So the author took it out to hang up, thinking they were helping free up the dryer. But then the owner came back later and got angry, leaving a note.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. If there's no explicit rule against taking someone else's clothes from a dryer, maybe the author thought it was acceptable. But generally, taking someone else's belongings without permission is a problem. Even if the intention was good, the action was unauthorized. The owner had a valid reason\u2014they were drying a blazer for an interview. The author might not have known the item's purpose, but that doesn't necessarily absolve them. The author could have asked if the dryer was in use or if they could take it, but instead assumed it was okay. Also, the fact that the dryer had only one item might mean the owner was using it for a specific reason, like a delicate item. Taking it out could have ruined the item, even if it seemed dry. So the author might be in the wrong for not getting permission. But on the other hand, the dorm had a shortage of dryers, and the clothes were taking up space. Maybe the author was trying to be helpful. But the main issue is taking someone else's property without asking. So probably answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
