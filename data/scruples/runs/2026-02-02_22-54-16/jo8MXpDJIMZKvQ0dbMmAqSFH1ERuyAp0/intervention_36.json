Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The context is a college dorm with limited dryers\u2014only 4, and all were in use. The author noticed that someone had a single item (a blazer) in a dryer for 75 minutes, which was already dry. The author took it out to free up the dryer, which helped reduce the pile of wet clothes. The person left a note angry about it, saying they were using the dryer for a job interview blazer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and norms of the dorm. If there's no explicit policy against taking others' clothes from a dryer, then maybe it's a judgment call. The author's intention was to prevent a bottleneck by freeing up a dryer. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a gray area. \n\nOn the one hand, the dryer was being used inefficiently (only one item), so the author's action might be seen as helping others by optimizing resource use. On the other, removing someone else's belongings without consent could be considered a violation of their property, even if the action seems minor.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for conflict. The note left by the girl was aggressive, which might indicate she was stressed about her interview. The author might not have known the item was in the dryer for that purpose. But the author also didn't ask permission, which could be a point against them.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people generally expect their belongings to be respected. Even if the situation was frustrating, taking someone else's clothes without asking could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's action did resolve a problem for others waiting. \n\nConsidering these factors, the answer isn't entirely clear. But since the author acted without consent, even with good intentions, there's a case that they are in the wrong. However, if the dorm has no rules against this and the action was to help with a resource shortage, some might argue they're not. The user initially thought the author wasn't in the wrong, but the note's tone and the fact that the blazer was for an interview might tip the balance. However, the key point is whether taking the clothes was a breach of trust or property rights. \n\nI think the correct answer is that the author is in the wrong because they took someone else's belongings without permission, even if their intention was to help. Respecting others' property is a fundamental social norm, and even in shared spaces, taking items without asking is a violation. The fact that the dryer was inefficiently used doesn't excuse the action.\n"
