Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is at fault. The situation is at a college dorm with limited dryers. The person took a girl's clothes out because all dryers were full, and she had only one item in a dryer for 75 minutes. She then hung it up after 40 minutes, but later the girl left a note upset because she was using the dryer for a blazer needed for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the laundry room. If there's no rule against taking others' clothes out of a dryer, then maybe it's a judgment call. However, even if there's no explicit rule, generally, you're supposed to wait for your own clothes to finish and not interfere with others' items. The person took the clothes out because they were \"relatively dry,\" but that doesn't mean it's okay. They might have caused the other person to lose time or have her clothes not dry properly, even if they looked okay.\n\nAlso, the dryers were already in short supply, so taking someone else's clothes might have been an attempt to free up the dryer faster. But if the other person was using the dryer for a blazer needed for an important interview, that's a time-sensitive situation. The person who took the clothes might not have known the urgency, but they did take the initiative without permission. \n\nAnother angle is the ownership of the clothes. Since they're in someone else's dryer, it's their property. Taking it without consent is a breach of trust. Even if the clothes were left unattended, it's still someone else's belongings. The person might have been in a hurry, but that doesn't justify taking others' items. \n\nThe note from the girl was confrontational, but the initial action of removing the clothes was still unauthorized. The argument that \"if I had known, I would have left it\" is a common one, but it doesn't absolve the action. The responsibility lies with the person taking the clothes to check or ask first. \n\nIn terms of consequences, the blazer might have been damaged or not dried properly. The person taking the clothes didn't know the other was in a hurry, but they still acted without permission. The dorm's limited resources mean that people rely on each other to follow unspoken rules. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person who took the clothes did act inconsiderately. Even though the dryers were full, they shouldn't have taken someone else's clothes. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
