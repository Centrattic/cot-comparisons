My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister H inherited a Confederate flag from her friends' grandmother, which was used in battle. It's described as a personal memento, not displayed publicly. The brother D destroyed it, leading the author to be upset with him. The author found the flag torn in the trash and hid it from the sister, not telling her. \n\nThe key points here are: the flag is a personal item with sentimental value, the family doesn't support the Confederacy, and the brother destroyed it without consent. The author's actions are to hide the flag and confront the brother, but they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know the opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's main issue is their reaction to the brother's action. The brother destroyed something that wasn't his to destroy, which is clearly wrong. The author's response is to confront the brother and hide the flag. The only questionable part might be not telling the sister, but that's to protect her feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're upset about their brother's actions towards their sister. The brother's actions were wrong, so the author being upset makes sense. The author's own actions (hiding the flag) are protective. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The brother is the one at fault here for destroying a personal item without consent, regardless of the flag's symbolism.\n"
