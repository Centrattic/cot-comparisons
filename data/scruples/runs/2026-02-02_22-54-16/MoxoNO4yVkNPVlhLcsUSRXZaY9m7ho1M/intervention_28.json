My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for being angry at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited. The situation is that the sister H has a Confederate flag in her old bedroom, which she got from her friends' grandmother and grandfather. The family lives in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy. The brother D, who's known for being hard to get along with, took it down and destroyed it, thinking it was a racist symbol. The author found it in the trash, saved it, and is upset with D but hasn't told the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The sister H sees the flag as a personal memento with sentimental value, not as a public display of racism. The brother D acted out of what he believed was right, removing something he associated with racism. The author is upset because D destroyed something without understanding its significance, even though the family is against the Confederacy. \n\nThe key points here are about respect for personal items and the right to make such decisions. Even if the flag is a symbol the family doesn't support, it's a family heirloom with emotional value. Destroying it without consent is a problem. The author's anger is justified because D took it upon himself to destroy something that wasn't his to begin with, and the sister might be hurt if she finds out. The author is trying to protect the sister's feelings by not telling her, which is a kind action. \n\nHowever, the author is also complicit by hiding the flag instead of confronting the situation. They might be avoiding conflict but aren't addressing the core issue. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The action of being mad at D is understandable, but the act of hiding the flag and not informing the sister could be seen as withholding information. \n\nBut in this context, the sister's privacy and emotional well-being are at stake. The author is trying to prevent D from causing further harm by not revealing the destruction. So, the author's actions, while perhaps not the best approach, are motivated by protecting their sister. \n\nThe brother D's actions are definitely questionable. Destroying someone else's inherited item is a breach of trust and respect. The author is justified in being angry. The answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
