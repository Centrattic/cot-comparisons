My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that the sister inherited. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The brother D is described as hard to get along with, but sometimes nice. The sister H has a Confederate flag that's a family heirloom, given by her grandparents' friends, and it's a cherished memory. The author found the flag torn in the trash, so they assume their brother did it, thinking he made a statement about her being racist. The author then hides the remains and doesn't tell the sister, but confronts the brother, who doesn't think it was wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A or B.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether destroying someone else's personal property without consent is wrong. The Confederate flag is a sensitive symbol, especially in the U.S., but the sister didn't display it publicly\u2014it was a private, inherited item with sentimental value. The brother destroyed it, likely due to his political beliefs, but the author is upset because the sister didn't want it gone. \n\nThe author's actions: they didn't confront the sister, just the brother. They hid the flag, which might be an attempt to protect the sister from the brother's actions. But was the author in the wrong? Well, the brother's act of destroying the flag without consent is a problem. The author's anger seems justified if the brother's action was disrespectful, especially since the flag was a personal momento. However, the author didn't stop the brother from doing it\u2014they just reacted after. Also, hiding the remains could be seen as trying to cover up the brother's action, but maybe the intention was to preserve it. \n\nIs the author at fault for being mad? The author is upset that the brother destroyed the flag, which is a personal item. The brother's action is unethical because he took away someone else's property without their consent. The author's anger towards the brother is reasonable. The author didn't destroy the flag themselves but is upset about the brother's actions. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the brother's actions were the issue. The author's reaction is to protect their sister's feelings, not to condone the brother's behavior. They didn't do anything wrong; the brother did.\n"
