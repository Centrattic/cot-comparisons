My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that the sister inherited. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister inherited the flag as a personal memento, even though the family doesn't support the Confederacy. The brother destroyed it without asking, seeing it as a racist symbol. The author is mad at the brother for this, thinking he overstepped. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The sister's flag is a personal item with sentimental value from her late friends' family. The brother, however, saw it as a racist symbol and decided to destroy it. The author is upset with the brother for doing this without discussing it with the sister. \n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The flag's significance to the sister, 2) The brother acting unilaterally, 3) The author's disapproval of that action.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the brother's action seems problematic. Destroying someone else's property without their consent is a strong action, especially when it's a sentimental item. Even if the brother had a strong opinion against the symbol, he shouldn't have destroyed it without discussing it with the sister. The author's anger is justified because the brother violated the sister's personal property and emotional connection to the item.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being upset. They're protecting their sister's feelings and the brother's overreach. The brother's actions disregarded consent and the personal significance of the item. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
