My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, the context: The brother destroyed the flag, which was a personal memento from their sister's friends' family. The sister doesn't display it publicly, and the family isn't in the South. The author is upset because the flag had sentimental value, even though they don't support the Confederacy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The author isn't the one who destroyed the flag; they're the one who's upset about it. The brother did the action, but the author is defending their sister and being angry at the brother. \n\nThe key here is whether the author has any responsibility here. The author found the flag in the trash, tried to save it, and confronted the brother. They didn't condone the brother's actions. The issue is the brother's actions, not the author's. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for their sister's sentimental item. The brother's destruction was wrong, and the author's anger is justified. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
