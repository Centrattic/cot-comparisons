My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited.\n\nFirst, context is important. The sister inherited the flag as a personal memento from her late friends' family. It's a cherished item, even though she doesn't display it publicly. The brother destroyed it, thinking it's racist. The author found it torn up and hid it, not telling the sister. The author is upset with the brother for his actions.\n\nNow, the key points. The brother's action was destruction of a sentimental item. The author is defending the sister's right to keep it as a personal memory. The brother's justification is based on opposing racism. But the flag is a family heirloom, not being used to promote racism. The author is upset about the brother's overreach, so they feel justified in being angry. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's main issue is with the brother's actions, not the sister's ownership. So the author isn't in the wrong for being mad. The brother likely overstepped his bounds by destroying the flag without discussion. The author's response (hiding it and confronting the brother) seems reasonable. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
