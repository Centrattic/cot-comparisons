My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the family context: the brother D is the oldest, sister H is second, and the author is third. The author mentions that D can be hard to get along with but isn't always bad. The sister H has a Confederate flag that's a family heirloom from her grandparents, which she keeps in her bedroom. The flag is a personal memento, not displayed publicly. The family lives in the northern USA and doesn't support the Confederacy.\n\nNow, during a Christmas visit, the author finds the flag torn up in the trash. They assume their brother did it, confront him, but he doesn't think it's wrong. The author hides the flag to protect their sister's feelings but doesn't tell her.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: Does the brother have the right to destroy someone else's personal property? Is the author justified in being angry about that?\n\nThe sister's flag is a personal item with emotional value. Even if the flag is associated with a controversial or offensive group, the sister chose to keep it as a memento. Destroying someone else's property without consent is generally wrong, regardless of the item's nature. The brother acted unilaterally, which is a breach of respect for her ownership and emotional attachment.\n\nThe author's reaction seems to be about protecting their sister's feelings and holding their brother accountable for his actions. The author didn't destroy the flag themselves but tried to cover up the damage out of concern for their sister. That shows they care about her feelings over the brother's actions.\n\nThe brother's justification (if he even has one) isn't presented here, but his actions are vandalism. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the destruction of a cherished family item. They're standing up for their sister's rights and feelings, which is valid.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
