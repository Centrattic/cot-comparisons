My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a brother destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. The author is upset about it, but the question is whether they are in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The Confederate flag is a controversial symbol, especially in the US, as it's associated with slavery and the Confederacy. In the northern US, where the family lives, there might be more opposition to the flag. However, in this case, the sister didn't display it publicly; it was in her private bedroom, and she viewed it as a personal memento from her late relatives. The brother destroyed it without her consent, leading to the author's anger.\n\nThe author is the third sibling, and the brother in question is the oldest. The brother has a reputation for being hard to get along with and making events miserable, but he's not entirely unpleasant. The author found the flag torn up in the trash, collected the pieces, and hid them without telling the sister. The brother doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to assess their actions. The author didn't destroy the flag; they intervened by saving it and hiding it. They also confronted the brother about it, calling him an \"ass.\" The brother destroyed someone else's property without permission, which is the issue here. The author's actions seem to be in defense of their sister's feelings and the sentimental value of the item.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The brother destroyed the flag without consent, which is wrong. 2) The author tried to mitigate the damage by saving the flag and not revealing the act to the sister, possibly to protect her feelings. 3) The author's anger is directed at the brother's actions, not the flag's symbolism itself.\n\nSince the author isn't responsible for the destruction and tried to help, their anger is justified. The brother is the one in the wrong for destroying the item without permission. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
