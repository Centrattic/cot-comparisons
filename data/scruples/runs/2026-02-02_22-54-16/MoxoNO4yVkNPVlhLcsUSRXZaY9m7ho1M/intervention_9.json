My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a brother destroying a Confederate flag that the sister inherited as a personal memento. The author is upset that their brother did this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister got the flag from her best friend's grandmother and grandfather, who were close to her. It's a very old flag, from the Civil War, and she never displays it publicly. The family is in the Northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy. So the flag isn't a public statement of Confederate support, just a personal keepsake with sentimental value.\n\nThe brother, who's described as hard to get along with, destroyed the flag, thinking it's racist. The author is upset because the sister has no intention of displaying it, and it's a cherished item. The author themselves collected the torn pieces and hid them to protect the sister's feelings.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. The author didn't destroy the flag; they're angry on their sister's behalf. The brother's actions are the main issue here. The author's response is to confront the brother and hide the flag to prevent further damage. They didn't tell the sister, which might be a point of contention, but the main issue is the brother's destruction of a personal memento.\n\nThe brother's action is problematic because he destroyed something that was valued, even if he believed it was for the right reasons. The author is defending their sister's right to keep a personal item, regardless of its historical context. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset; the brother is the one who acted without considering the sentimental value. The author's actions (collecting the flag and hiding it) are protective, not harmful.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
