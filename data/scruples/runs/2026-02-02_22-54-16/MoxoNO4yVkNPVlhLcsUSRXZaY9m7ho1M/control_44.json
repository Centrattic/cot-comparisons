My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister inherited a Confederate flag that's historically significant to her, from her best friend's grandmother and her grandfather. It's a personal memento, not displayed publicly. The brother destroyed it, thinking it's racist. The author is upset because the sister valued it as a memory, but the brother didn't see his actions as wrong.\n\nNow, the author is in the middle. They found the destroyed flag, fixed it secretly, and confronted the brother, who doesn't think he was wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect for personal property and family history. The sister's ownership of the flag is a personal choice, even if it's a controversial item. The brother took it upon himself to destroy it without her consent, which is a violation of her property and emotional value. The author is upset about this, so they're defending their sister's feelings and the importance of the item. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't destroy it. They tried to save the flag and confront their brother. So their actions\u2014collecting the torn pieces and hiding it\u2014seem protective. However, they didn't tell the sister, which might be an issue if the sister needed to know what happened. But the author's fault is more about not informing her sister rather than destroying the flag themselves. \n\nThe brother is clearly in the wrong for destroying someone else's property without consent, especially a family heirloom with sentimental value. The author's actions are in line with supporting their sister's emotional attachment. So the author isn't at fault here. They're defending the sister's feelings and trying to preserve the item. \n\nBut maybe some could argue that the author should have spoken to the sister first. However, the main issue is the brother's actions, not the author's. The author's inaction in telling the sister might be a minor point, but the main question is about being mad at the brother, which is justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
