My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. The author is upset about this.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The sister got the flag as a personal memento from her friends' grandparents. It's not on public display, just in her bedroom which she no longer uses. The family, especially living in the northern US, don't support the Confederacy. The brother destroyed the flag, thinking it's racist, and the author is upset about that, calling him an ass but not telling the sister.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The brother's action was tearing up a sentimental item without consent. Even if the flag is controversial, destroying someone else's personal property without their permission is usually wrong. The sister has a right to her heirloom, regardless of its symbolism. The brother made a judgment and destroyed it without discussing it with her. The author is frustrated but hasn't confronted the sister yet. \n\nThe key points here: respect for personal property, lack of consent, and the emotional value to the sister. The brother's actions were disrespectful and caused harm. The author is not in the wrong for being upset. So answer B (No) the author is not in the wrong.\n"
