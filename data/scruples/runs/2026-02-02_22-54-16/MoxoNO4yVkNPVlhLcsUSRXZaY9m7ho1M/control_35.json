My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying the Confederate flag. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the sister H inherited a Confederate flag from her grandparents. It's an old battle flag, a personal memento, not displayed publicly. The family in the northern US doesn't support the Confederacy. The brother D destroyed it, thinking it was racist. The author found it in the trash, fixed it, didn't tell the sister, and is upset with the brother.\n\nSo, considering the context: the flag is a sentimental item, even if it's a controversial symbol. The brother acted on his belief that the flag is racist, but he destroyed it without consulting the sister, who values it as a memory. The author is upset because the brother took this action without considering the sister's feelings. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the sister's feelings matter here. Even if the flag represents something the brother opposes, destroying it without consent is disrespectful. The author supporting the sister's emotional value of the item makes sense. The brother's action was overstepping, and the author's anger is justified. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
