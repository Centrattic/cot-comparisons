My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from all angles. The author's sister inherited a Confederate flag, which was from her best friend's grandmother and grandfather. It's an old, historical item, but in the North, they don't support the Confederacy. The sister doesn't display it publicly; it's just a personal memento in her old bedroom. \n\nThe brother, who's known to be difficult, destroyed the flag, probably making a political or racist statement. The author found it torn up in the trash, fixed it, and didn't tell the sister. The author is upset with the brother for his actions.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the brother's action was definitely wrong. Destroying someone's personal memento without consent is a major issue, especially if it's something sentimental. The author is protecting their sister by hiding the flag and confronting the brother. The brother's actions could be seen as thoughtless and violating the sister's privacy and emotional connection to the item. \n\nThe author's anger is justified because the brother didn't respect their sister's feelings. Even though the flag is from the Confederacy, in this context, it's a family heirloom. The author isn't supporting the Confederacy by keeping it; they just value the sister's emotional attachment. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The brother's actions are the problem.\n"
