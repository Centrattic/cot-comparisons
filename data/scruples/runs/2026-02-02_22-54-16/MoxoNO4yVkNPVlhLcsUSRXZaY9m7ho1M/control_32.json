My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a brother destroying a Confederate flag that was a family heirloom for their sister. The author is upset and hiding the flag, while the brother does it because he thinks it's racist. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The sister inherited the flag from her friends' family, and it's a meaningful personal item. The brother destroyed it without asking, thinking it's a racist symbol. The author is upset and hid the flag to protect their sister. But does that make the author wrong?\n\nThe author didn't destroy the flag, so they aren't directly responsible for that action. However, maybe they should have done something to prevent it? But given the brother's hard-to-get-along-with nature, maybe the author felt it was best to protect the sister's feelings. Also, the sister doesn't display it publicly, so maybe it's a personal item they wanted to keep despite its historical context. \n\nThe brother's actions were disrespectful, but the author's response was to hide the flag and not confront their sister. Is the author wrong for not telling the sister what happened? Maybe the author wanted to avoid conflict, but the sister might have a right to know. However, the author's intention was to protect the sister from the brother's actions, which could be seen as a positive intent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the main issue is the brother's action, not the author's. The author is supporting their sister by hiding the flag and expressing disapproval to the brother. Unless there's a legal aspect (but Confederate flags aren't illegal in the US), the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
