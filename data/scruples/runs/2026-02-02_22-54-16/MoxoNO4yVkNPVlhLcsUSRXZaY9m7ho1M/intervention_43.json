My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being angry at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister inherited the flag as a personal memento from her best friend's grandmother and grandfather, who were significant to her. It's a family heirloom, even though the family lives in the North and doesn't support the Confederacy. The sister doesn't display it publicly; it's in a private bedroom that she no longer uses. The brother destroyed it, thinking it was a statement against racism, but the sister values it emotionally.\n\nThe author collected the flag after it was destroyed and hid it from the brother, not telling their sister. The author is upset with the brother for destroying something personal and meaningful without asking.\n\nNow, the key points: Is destroying a personal memento acceptable? Even if the brother's intention was to make a statement, destroying someone else's property without consent is a problem. The flag has sentimental value, and the brother didn't own it. The author's actions\u2014saving the flag\u2014show they care about the sister's feelings. The brother's action was disrespectful, regardless of his reasoning. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. The answer should be B.\n"
