My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Confederate flag that the sister inherited. The brother destroyed it, thinking it's racist, and the author is upset about that. The author didn't tell the sister, just hid the flag.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The family is in the northern USA, so they don't support the Confederacy. The flag is a personal item for the sister, a memento from her friends' family. It's not public; it's in her bedroom. The brother, D, ripped it up because of his views. The author is angry about this because the sister valued it, even if it's a Confederate flag. The author took the flag from the trash and hid it but didn't tell the sister. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. Let's break it down. The author didn't destroy the flag, just tried to protect the sister's feelings. They confronted the brother about his actions, which seems reasonable. By hiding the flag, the author might be trying to prevent conflict, but maybe they should have told the sister instead. However, the author's main issue is with the brother's action, not their own. \n\nThe author is in the sister's defense here. The brother acted without considering her feelings. The author's actions don't seem malicious. They preserved the flag as much as possible. However, there's a question of whether the author should have informed the sister. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't destroy the flag and tried to mitigate the damage, their actions don't seem wrong. The brother is the one who acted without consent. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
