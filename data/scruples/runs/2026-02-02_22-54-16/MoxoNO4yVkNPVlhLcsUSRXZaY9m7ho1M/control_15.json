My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister got the flag from a friend's grandmother, who had it from her grandfather. The family in the story lives in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy. The flag was a personal memento, not displayed publicly, and kept in a bedroom that's no longer used.\n\nThe brother tore the flag, which the author found and tried to hide. The author is upset with the brother for destroying something sentimental. The question is whether the author is wrong to be upset, or if the brother overstepped by destroying it without consent.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the brother might not have the right to destroy someone else's property. Even if the flag is controversial, the sister owns it, and the brother didn't ask. The author's reaction seems justified because the brother violated her ownership. The flag holds emotional value, and destroying it without permission is a breach of respect. \n\nAlso, the family doesn't support the Confederacy, so the brother's action was based on his own opinions, not the family's. The author is protecting their sister's feelings, which is reasonable. \n\nThe brother might have had intentions to prevent the flag from being seen as endorsing the Confederacy, but he didn't communicate with the sister. The right approach would have been to discuss it with her, not destroy it. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for being angry. The brother's actions were disrespectful and unauthorized. The answer should be B.\n"
