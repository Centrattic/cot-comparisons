My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister, H, has a Confederate flag that was a personal memento from her late best friend's grandmother. It's a cherished item, even though she doesn't display it publicly. The brother, D, destroyed it, and the author found out, got angry, but didn't tell their sister.\n\nThe key points here are: \n- The flag is a personal memorial for the sister, not a public symbol of support for the Confederacy.\n- The family is in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy.\n- The brother destroyed it without considering the sentimental value.\n- The author is upset because the brother's actions hurt their sister, but they didn't confront her immediately.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The brother acted without consent, destroying something that had emotional value. Destroying someone else's property, even if it's a symbol the person dislikes, is a violation of their autonomy. The author's anger is justified because the brother's action was disrespectful and caused harm. \n\nHowever, the author didn't inform the sister, which might be a point of contention. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. Since the brother's actions were inappropriate, the author's reaction makes sense. Also, the author tried to save the flag, which shows they care about their sister's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The brother's actions were the problem, not the author's anger towards him.\n"
