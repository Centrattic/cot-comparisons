My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the brother (D) destroyed the flag, which the sister (H) inherited. The flag is a personal memento from her grandparents and their family. The author is upset with D for doing this, even though they all don't support the Confederacy. The author didn't confront their sister directly but hid the flag instead. The brother doesn't think he was wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The flag is a family heirloom with sentimental value. Destroying it without consent is a problem because it's someone else's property. However, the author didn't destroy it; they were upset about it. The author's actions were to hide the flag and confront D, but not H. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author's anger seems justified because the flag was a personal item. However, their decision to hide it instead of telling their sister might be seen as withholding important information. But maybe they wanted to protect their sister from the emotional impact. \n\nThe brother's action of destroying the flag without asking is definitely problematic. The author is defending their sister's feelings, which is reasonable. The author's responsibility here is more about standing up for their sister's right to her property, even if the item is controversial. Since the author didn't destroy the flag, their main issue is with D's actions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Their sister's emotional connection to the item is valid, and destroying it without consent is an overstep. The author's choice to hide the flag might be a gray area, but their intention was to protect their sister. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
