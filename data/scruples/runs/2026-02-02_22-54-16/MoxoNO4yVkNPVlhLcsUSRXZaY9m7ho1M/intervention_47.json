My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their brother destroyed a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister, H, inherited the flag from her friend's grandmother. It's described as an old Confederate flag used in battle, and it's a personal memento for her. The family is in the northern USA and doesn't support the Confederacy. The flag was in her bedroom, which she no longer sleeps in, and she wouldn't display it publicly. \n\nThe brother, D, destroyed the flag, likely because he thought it was racist. The author found the torn flag in the trash, collected it, and hid it without telling their sister. They're upset with their brother for doing this, and the brother doesn't think he was wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom what I understand, the author is defending their sister's sentimental value of the item, even though it's a Confederate flag. The key points here are the emotional significance of the item to the sister and the brother's actions without consent. \n\nDestroying someone else's personal property, even if one disagrees with its symbolism, is generally considered wrong unless there's a legal justification. The brother acted on his own without discussing it with his sister, which could be seen as a violation of her autonomy. The author is protecting their sister's feelings and the item's importance to her, which seems reasonable. \n\nHowever, the Confederate flag is a symbol with a problematic history, and some might argue that destroying it could be seen as a moral stance against racism. But in this case, the sister doesn't display it publicly and sees it as a personal memento. The brother's action was impulsive and without consent, which is problematic. \n\nThe author's response\u2014hiding the flag and confronting the brother\u2014is about protecting their sister's feelings and preserving the item. The author isn't supporting the Confederacy but is respecting their sister's emotional attachment. The brother's actions were disrespectful, so the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about it. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
