My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited.\n\nFirst, the context: The brother destroyed a Confederate flag that the sister had as a personal, historical memento. The family is in the North and doesn't support the Confederacy. The flag was in the sister's bedroom, not displayed publicly. The brother's action was tearing it up, which the author is upset about. The author didn't confront the sister but hid the flag and reprimanded the brother, who didn't think he was wrong.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the brother's action and the author's response. The brother's action was to destroy a personal item without consent. Even if the flag is controversial, destroying someone else's property without permission is generally wrong. The sister had an emotional attachment to it as a memento. The brother's motivation (thinking it's racist) might be his justification, but that doesn't make it okay to destroy it without asking.\n\nThe author's response was to hide the flag and tell the brother he's an ass. They didn't confront the sister, which could be a point of criticism. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the brother's action was the initial wrongdoing, the author's anger seems justified. The author didn't do anything to escalate the situation; they just reprimanded the brother. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
