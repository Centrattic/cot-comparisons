My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister inherited the flag as a personal memento from her friends' grandparents. It's a very old flag, from a battle, and it's important to her emotionally. The brother destroyed it, thinking it's racist, even though the sister doesn't display it publicly and the family is from the North, not supporting the Confederacy. The author found out, hid the flag, and confronts the brother, who doesn't think he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the flag's sentimental value vs. the brother's moral objection. The author is upset because the flag was destroyed without consent. The brother acted on his own, destroying something personal to the sister. The author didn't stop him but hid the remains instead of confronting them both. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the brother's actions were disrespectful and possibly illegal (vandalism), but the author didn't destroy it themselves. They tried to protect the sister's feelings by hiding the flag. The author's anger is justified because the brother acted without permission. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like confronting the brother immediately or talking to the sister. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the brother did the harmful act, the author isn't necessarily wrong for being upset. The answer is B, no.\n"
