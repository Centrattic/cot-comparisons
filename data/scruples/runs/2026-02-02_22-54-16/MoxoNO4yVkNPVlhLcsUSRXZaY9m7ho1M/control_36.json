My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the brother destroyed a Confederate flag that the sister inherited. The flag is an old one from a battle, passed down through family friends. The sister doesn't display it publicly, it's in her bedroom, which she doesn't sleep in anymore. The family is from the Northern US, and they don't support the Confederacy. The author is upset with the brother for destroying the flag, which was a meaningful keepsake, and the brother doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and historical aspects. Confederate flags are a sensitive topic in the US. Depending on the state, there might be laws about defacing or destroying such items, but I'm not sure. The key here is the item's status as a historical artifact and a personal memento. \n\nThe sister received it from her friend's grandmother and grandfather, who were close to her. It's the only thing she has to remember them. The brother destroyed it without her consent, which is a big issue. Even if he had a reason, destroying someone else's property without permission is generally wrong. The author is upset because the item was important to the sister, and the brother acted impulsively.\n\nThe author's role here is that they found the flag torn up and hid it, not telling the sister. But the main question is about the brother's actions, not the author's. The author isn't in the wrong for being mad; the brother is the one who destroyed the item. The author is taking the sister's side here, which is understandable. The brother's actions were disrespectful and caused emotional harm. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author's anger is justified because the brother destroyed something valuable to the sister without consent, and the author is standing up for the sister. The brother's actions are the issue here, not the author's response.\n"
