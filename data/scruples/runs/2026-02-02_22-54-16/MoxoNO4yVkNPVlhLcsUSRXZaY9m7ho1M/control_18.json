My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited.\n\nFirst, context is important. The sister inherited the flag as a personal memento from her friends' family. It's not on public display, just in her bedroom which she doesn't use anymore. The family doesn't support the Confederacy, but the flag has sentimental value. The brother destroyed it without discussing it, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe author is upset because the brother acted without considering the emotional significance. The key points here are respect for personal property and sentimental items. Even if the brother had a different opinion, destroying the item without discussion is a problem. The author covering for the sister by hiding the flag shows they value her feelings and the item's importance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions\u2014being angry at the brother for destroying a meaningful item\u2014seem justified. The brother's actions were disrespectful. The author didn't do anything wrong by protecting the sister's feelings. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
