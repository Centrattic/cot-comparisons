My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister inherited a Confederate flag from a friend's grandmother, who knew it from her grandfather. It's a personal memento, not displayed publicly. The brother, who's known to be difficult, destroyed it without asking. The author is upset and hid the flag to protect their sister.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the flag's significance as a personal item, the brother's actions being impulsive and disrespectful, and the author's reaction. The question is whether the author is wrong for being angry at their brother.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being upset because the brother's actions were disrespectful towards their sister's sentimental item. The author tried to protect the sister by hiding the flag and confronting the brother. The brother's justification, if any, isn't mentioned, but destroying someone else's property without consent is generally wrong. Even if the flag is controversial, the sister's emotional attachment matters. The author isn't the one who destroyed it; they're reacting to it. So, the answer should be B.\n"
