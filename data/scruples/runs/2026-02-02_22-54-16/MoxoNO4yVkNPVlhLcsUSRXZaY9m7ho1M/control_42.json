My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited. The context given is that the sister, H, has this flag which is a personal memento from her grandparents. The brother, D, who the author describes as hard to get along with, destroyed it, probably making a comment about its racist symbolism. The author helped hide the flag and didn't tell H, and D doesn't think he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are the brother's action of destroying a personal item without consent and the author's reaction. The family lives in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy, but the flag was a private memento. \n\nDestroying someone's personal property without their permission is generally considered wrong, regardless of the item's content. Even if the item is controversial, like a Confederate flag, the owner has the right to decide what to do with it. The brother's action was disrespectful because he took away something meaningful to his sister. \n\nThe author didn't destroy the flag themselves. They found it in the trash, tried to preserve it, and kept it hidden. They also confronted their brother about it, calling him an \"ass.\" The author's actions seem to be protecting their sister's feelings and the sentimental value of the flag. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the brother's destruction was wrong, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and helping to preserve the item. The author's actions are a response to the brother's, which are themselves questionable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
