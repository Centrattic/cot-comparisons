My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for being upset with their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister inherited the flag through her friend's family, and it's a sentimental item for her. The family lives in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy. The flag was kept in a private setting, not displayed publicly. The brother destroyed it without consulting anyone, which the author found wrong.\n\nThe author didn't destroy the flag themselves but got angry and tried to hide it. They confronted their brother but didn't tell the sister. The key points here are the intention behind the brother's action, the value of the sentimental item, and the author's response.\n\nThe brother's action was destructive without consent, which is a problem. Even if the flag's symbolism is controversial, destroying someone else's property, especially a family heirloom, is a violation. The author's response was to protect the item and confront the brother, which seems reasonable given the sister's emotional attachment.\n\nHowever, the author didn't directly address the sister or take steps to repair the flag. But their main issue was with the brother's actions. Since the brother acted without considering the sentimental value, the author's anger is justified. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset; their brother's actions were the main issue here.\n"
