My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a brother destroying a Confederate flag that the sister inherited as a personal memento. The author is upset about this and is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The Confederate flag is a sensitive symbol, especially in the US. It's associated with the Confederacy, which was fighting to preserve slavery. Generally, displaying or supporting such symbols can be seen as promoting racism. However, in this case, the sister doesn't display the flag publicly; it's a private memento from her friends' family. The family in the story mentions they live in the northern USA and don't support the Confederacy. So the flag is more of a sentimental item rather than a political statement.\n\nNow, the brother destroyed the flag, thinking it's racist. The author is upset because this was a meaningful item to the sister. The brother's action was intentional, destroying someone else's property without consent. Even if the brother thought he was doing the right thing by removing a symbol of racism, he didn't have the authority to destroy someone else's personal possession. That seems like a breach of respect for property and personal sentiment.\n\nThe author's response was to hide the flag and not tell the sister, then confront the brother. The author's actions here are trying to protect the sister's feelings and preserve the memento. The brother, on the other hand, acted without considering the emotional value, which might have been a better approach to discuss rather than discard it.\n\nConsidering all that, the brother's actions were wrong because he destroyed personal property without consent. The author's actions were in line with protecting the sister's feelings and the item, so the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are consent, respect for personal property, and understanding the sentimental value versus the symbolic meaning. The author's stance seems justified here.\n"
