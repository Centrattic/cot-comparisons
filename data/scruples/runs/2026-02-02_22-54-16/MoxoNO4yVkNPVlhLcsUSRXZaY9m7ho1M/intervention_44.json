My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote about their brother destroying their sister's Confederate flag is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother destroyed the flag, which was a personal memento from her grandparents. The author is upset with their brother for doing this without considering the sentimental value. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants a confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The sister inherited the flag as a personal item, not displayed publicly, and it's a cherished memory. The brother destroyed it, thinking it was racist, but the author is angry because it was a personal item. The family doesn't support the Confederacy, but the flag is a keepsake. The author didn't confront the sister, just the brother.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were to collect the flag and hide it, not to retaliate or spread the incident. They confronted their brother, calling him out for his actions. The brother's action was the problem, not the author's response. The author's anger is justified because they value the sentimental aspect. The brother's act was disrespectful and overstepping. The author didn't do anything to escalate the situation beyond collecting the flag. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
