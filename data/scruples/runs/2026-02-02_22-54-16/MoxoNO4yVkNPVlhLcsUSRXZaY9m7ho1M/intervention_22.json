My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for being angry at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited. The context is that the flag is an old, battle-used item from the sister's late grandparents, and the brother and sister both moved away from their hometown in the northern USA, where they don't support the Confederacy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister H inherited the flag as a personal memento from important people in her life. Even though the flag is associated with the Confederacy, which is widely seen as a symbol of racism and the pro-slavery cause, the sister doesn't display it publicly and keeps it in her private bedroom. The brother D, on the other hand, destroyed it, thinking it was a racist symbol. The author (third child) found out and is upset with D but hasn't told H yet.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are about respect for personal property and the emotional significance of heirlooms. Even if the flag is a controversial symbol, it's H's personal item with sentimental value. D took it without consent, which is a violation of her property. The author is standing up for their sister, which is understandable. However, the author didn't confront H directly, which might be a point of contention. But the main question is about the author being in the wrong for being mad, not about their actions towards H.\n\nAnother angle is the moral aspect. The brother might believe he's doing the right thing by destroying something he sees as racist. But even in that case, he should have discussed it with his sister instead of taking it upon himself. The author's anger is justified because D acted without asking and destroyed something meaningful. The author's choice not to tell H yet is perhaps to protect her feelings, which might be seen as considerate rather than wrong.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the brother's actions. The brother's act of destroying the flag without consent is the main issue here. The author is supporting their sister's emotional value of the item, which is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
