He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on their girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend gets upset when the author is talking to a female coworker, but she has an ex she talks to regularly. The author is pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy, even if the ex is far away and they don't talk often. However, the author isn't doing anything wrong\u2014they're just having a work-related conversation with a coworker. The key point is the double standard: the girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with an ex, but the author isn't allowed to have a platonic female friend at work.\n\nThe author's intention here is to highlight this inconsistency, which is a fair point. They aren't acting out of malice but to point out unfair treatment. The coworker isn't a romantic interest, and the author hasn't crossed any boundaries. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or past experiences, but that doesn't justify being unfair.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author is considering bringing it up again, which shows they want to address the issue rather than let it fester. However, approaching it in a constructive way is important. Yelling or being confrontational might escalate things. But the core issue is about fairness, so the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to discuss it.\n\nPotential problems: If the author brings it up in a hurtful way, that could be problematic, but the question is about whether they were in the wrong in the initial situation. Since they're just pointing out the double standard, they're not acting inconsiderately. The girlfriend's reaction is the issue here.\n\nSo, overall, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing an unfair situation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
