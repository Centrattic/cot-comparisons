He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on his girlfriend regarding her ex and his coworker friend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally about mutual friends and home stuff. The author doesn't mind this because they live a few hours apart and it's not frequent. Then, the girlfriend gets upset when she sees him chatting with coworker A during lunch. The author points out the inconsistency, comparing his friendship with A to her ex.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is wrong. The key here is about mutual respect and boundaries in a relationship. The author didn't have a romantic relationship with coworker A, just a friendly, work-related one. The girlfriend, however, had a past romantic relationship with her ex, which is different. The author is highlighting the double standard here.\n\nBut wait, even though there's a difference between a past relationship and a current friendship, the way the author is bringing it up might be seen as using it as a weapon. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity. The author should consider if his intention is to address the unfairness or to provoke. If he's using it to call her out without giving her a chance to explain, that could be problematic. However, the situation itself (the girlfriend being upset over a platonic work friend) does seem unfair, given her own history.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. The answer likely hinges on the context of their relationship dynamics. If the author is genuinely addressing a double standard without being confrontational, he's not in the wrong. But if he's using it to manipulate or hurt her feelings, then he would be. Based on the description, the author seems to be pointing out a legitimate issue, so the answer is probably B (No).\n"
