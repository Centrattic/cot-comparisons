He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend being upset because she saw him talking to a coworker named A during lunch. The author's girlfriend gets mad, and he's upset because she seems to be okay with talking to her ex, but he's not allowed to be friends with someone he's never even dated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away and they talk occasionally about mutual friends and stuff. The author's coworker A is just a friend, they've never been on a date, and the author doesn't have any romantic feelings now. The problem arises when the girlfriend gets upset over seeing them talking. The author is frustrated because he feels double standards; his girlfriend can talk to her ex, but he can't be friends with a coworker.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author might be in the right if the girlfriend's reaction is based on jealousy or insecurity rather than actual betrayal. If the author isn't doing anything inappropriate, like having a secret relationship or showing romantic interest, then his frustration is valid. However, maybe there's a lack of communication about what each partner considers acceptable behavior. The author could have discussed his concerns earlier instead of waiting for the situation to escalate. Also, turning the conversation back on her might not address the underlying issues; maybe she feels insecure or there's something else causing her reaction.\n\nBut, if the author is using this as an excuse to confront her about something trivial, that could be problematic. The fact that he's considering \"turning the tables\" might come off as manipulative or using her behavior as a justification for his own actions. It's important whether he's actually being fair. If he's not in the wrong for having a normal work friendship, then he's justified in pointing out her inconsistency. But if there are other factors, like past issues or specific boundaries not discussed, it could be more complex.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often expect their partners to be able to have platonic friendships with others of the opposite sex. So, if the author isn't doing anything wrong, the girlfriend's jealousy might be the issue here. However, the author's approach to confronting her could be the problem. Instead of using it as a way to accuse her, he should communicate his feelings and understand hers. So, the answer might depend on whether the author is engaging in a healthy conversation or just trying to deflect blame. If he's in the right, then answer B. If his approach is wrong, then A. But based on the info given, the author's actions in the situation described don't seem wrong, so B might be the answer.\n"
