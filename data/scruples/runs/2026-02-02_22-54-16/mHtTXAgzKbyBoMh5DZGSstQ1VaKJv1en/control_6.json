He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on their girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend being upset about the author chatting with a female coworker, while she herself talks to an ex-boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about fairness and double standards. The author points out that his girlfriend talks to her ex, but she's upset about his friendship with a coworker. The author isn't making a move on the coworker, just having a normal work-related friendship. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has a past relationship with her ex, which might be more intimate. The author is questioning why his innocent friendship is an issue when her contact with her ex isn't.\n\nI need to consider if there's a valid reason for the girlfriend's jealousy. Maybe she feels insecure or there's a history of issues. But the author's argument is about consistency. If both situations are similar in terms of frequency and nature, then the girlfriend's reaction might be unfair. However, past relationships can be sensitive, so maybe the comparison isn't entirely fair.\n\nAlso, the author is considering addressing this directly. Whether he should bring it up depends on how their relationship handles communication. If the girlfriend's ex is a known part of their lives, then the author's point about inconsistency is valid. But if the ex is a deeper issue, maybe the author isn't considering her feelings. However, the author isn't doing anything wrong by having a work friend, so he's not in the wrong here. The wrong might lie with the girlfriend's reaction being inconsistent. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
