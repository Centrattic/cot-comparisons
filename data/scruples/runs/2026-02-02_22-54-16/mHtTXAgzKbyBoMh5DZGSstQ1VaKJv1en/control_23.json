He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who's upset because the author was talking to a female coworker during lunch. The author is upset because his girlfriend is friendly with her ex, whom she still talks to regularly.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author mentions that the coworker, A, is a friend from work, and he's never made a move on her. They only talk for work-related reasons. The girlfriend, however, is upset about this interaction and the author is frustrated because she can talk to her ex, who she used to date, but he can't even be friends with a coworker. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to confront his girlfriend. Let me break it down. The key points are about fairness in relationships. The author feels jealous or upset because his girlfriend can have a past relationship while he can't have a friendship. Jealousy is a common issue in relationships, but the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for wanting to point out the inconsistency.\n\nOn one hand, he's within his rights to feel upset if his girlfriend is being double-standard about what's acceptable. If she's allowed to have a close relationship with her ex, but he can't have a friendship with a female coworker, that could be an issue. On the other hand, maybe the ex isn't the same as a current coworker. The ex is someone she used to date, so mutual friends and catching up could be different from someone who's nearby and working together daily.\n\nBut the author's actions here are about talking to a coworker during lunch, which is generally a normal workplace interaction. If the girlfriend is upset over a simple lunch chat, that might be her issue. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which is a valid conversation to have. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014calling her out\u2014might be confrontational. The question is about whether he's in the wrong, not if his approach is the best.\n\nThe problem is that the author is using his girlfriend's past behavior to justify his actions. But maybe he did something that crosses a line. However, based on the information given, there's no indication that he did anything wrong. He's just having a work lunch with a colleague. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if there's no actual infidelity or intent to pursue another relationship. \n\nSo, considering that the author hasn't done anything to warrant the girlfriend's anger beyond a normal work interaction, and she's applying a double standard, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be No, so B.\n"
