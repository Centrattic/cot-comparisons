He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who's upset because her partner talks to an ex, but she's not allowed to be friends with someone else. The author is trying to point out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away and they only talk occasionally about things like home and friends. The author doesn't mind that. Then there's the coworker A, who is a friend from work. The author has never made a move on her and only has her number for work reasons. They talk during lunch, which the girlfriend sees and gets upset about.\n\nThe author is frustrated because he's being treated unfairly. He's pointing out that his girlfriend can have a relationship with her ex, but he can't even have a platonic friendship with a coworker. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for bringing this up.\n\nI think the key points here are about consistency in expectations. If the girlfriend is allowed to have a past relationship that she maintains contact with, but the author isn't allowed to have a work-related friendship, that's a double standard. The author is trying to address that inconsistency, which is a reasonable thing to do. However, the way he does it might matter. If he's confrontational or uses it as an excuse to be unfaithful, that could be a problem. But based on his description, he's just pointing out the unfairness. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the double standard. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
