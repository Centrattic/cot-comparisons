He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves their girlfriend being upset about them chatting with a female coworker, while the girlfriend herself talks to her ex. The author is considering bringing up the hypocrisy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend saw them talking during lunch and got mad. The author argues that her being friends with her ex is okay, but he can't be friends with a colleague. The coworker is a work friend, and he never made any romantic moves. The ex lives a few hours away and they don't talk often.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, jealousy in relationships is common, but there's an element of double standards here. The girlfriend's ex is a past partner, but the coworker is just a friend. The author hasn't done anything wrong by being friends with a coworker, especially since there's no romantic interest. The issue might be the girlfriend's reaction rather than the author's actions. The author pointing out the inconsistency isn't necessarily wrong. So, Answer B (not in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
