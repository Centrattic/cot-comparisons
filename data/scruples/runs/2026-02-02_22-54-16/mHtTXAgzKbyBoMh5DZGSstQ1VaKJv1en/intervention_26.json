He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend being upset because she saw the author chatting with a female coworker. The author then questions why his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't even have a platonic relationship with a coworker he's never dated.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is in contact with her ex, which the author doesn't mind initially. The ex lives a few hours away, and they talk about home stuff and mutual friends. Then, the author's coworker, A, is a friend he's never pursued romantically. The girlfriend gets upset when she sees them chatting, which leads the author to confront her about the double standard.\n\nThe main issue here is the perceived double standard. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend can have a friendship with an ex (who is no longer in her life) but he's being unfairly judged for a platonic relationship with a coworker. The author is trying to highlight the inconsistency in her behavior. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or jealousy, even if the coworker is just a friend. However, the author's right to have friendships is valid. If the girlfriend is comfortable with her ex, then the author should be comfortable with his coworkers. The key here is whether the author crossed any boundaries. Since he didn't pursue the coworker and only has her number for work reasons, his actions seem legitimate.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to the girlfriend's perspective. She might feel that the author's friendship with A is a potential red flag, even if it's not intended. However, the author is pointing out the inconsistency, which is a reasonable approach. The question is whether confronting her about it is the right move. The user is considering bringing it up again, so the focus is on whether he's in the wrong for wanting to address the double standard.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't violating any clear boundaries. The issue is more about the girlfriend's feelings and how she's handling them. The author is trying to communicate his feelings, which is a healthy approach. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. However, it's important to consider how he approaches the conversation. If he's accusatory, that might escalate things, but the principle of addressing the double standard is valid.\n"
