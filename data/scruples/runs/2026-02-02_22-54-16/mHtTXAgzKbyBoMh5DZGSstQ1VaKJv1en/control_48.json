He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for confronting their girlfriend about her talking to her ex versus him talking to a female coworker. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which the author doesn't mind. The ex is a few hours away, and their conversations are about shared friends and home stuff. The author isn't upset about that, so maybe he's okay with some level of interaction.\n\nThen there's the coworker, A. The author and A are friends from work, the author used to find her cute but never made a move. They only have her number for work reasons. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got upset. The author is pointing out the double standard: why is it okay for the girlfriend to have a past relationship contact, but not for him to have a friendly coworker?\n\nThe author is considering bringing this up again. The key here is the perceived double standard. The author isn't in a relationship with A, so the situation is different from the girlfriend's ex. But the girlfriend is jealous, which might not be justified since there's no romantic intent. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's addressing a double standard. The girlfriend's reaction is based on jealousy without a valid reason, since there's no actual infidelity or intent to date the coworker. The author is just pointing out the inconsistency, which is a fair thing to do in a relationship to address unfair treatment. So the answer should be B.\n"
