He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy whose girlfriend gets upset when he talks to a female coworker. The guy asks her why she can be friends with her ex, who she used to be in a relationship with, but she's mad he's friends with someone he's never asked out. He's considering bringing this up to her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's ex is someone she's friends with, and they don't talk often, mostly about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker, A, is just a work friend, and he's never made a move on her. The girlfriend saw them talking and got upset. The author is frustrated because he feels double standards here.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. The girlfriend is friends with an ex, which is common, but she's upset about the author's friendship with another woman. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. The main issue here is about trust and communication. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author hasn't done anything wrong by having a work friend. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity. The author is trying to address the unfair treatment he's receiving. However, bringing up the ex might be a sensitive topic. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The act of pointing out inconsistency isn't necessarily wrong. However, how he brings it up matters. If he's using the ex as a way to justify his actions without considering her feelings, that could be problematic. But in this case, he's expressing his frustration about the unfair double standard. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's highlighting a possible double standard and hasn't acted on any inappropriate feelings. However, the situation also requires him to approach the conversation with empathy, not just to \"turn the tables.\" But based purely on the question of being in the wrong, the answer is B.\n"
