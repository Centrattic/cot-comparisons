He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who gets upset when the author chats with a female coworker. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly, which the author didn't mind before. The author is frustrated because he feels double standards are being applied.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away, and they talk about mutual friends and hometown stuff. That seems like a long-distance friendship. The author's coworker is only for work, and they've been friends since he started there. The author hasn't made any romantic moves on her. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting and was mad. The author is considering bringing up the double standard.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are about mutual respect and communication. The author didn't have any intention to flirt with the coworker, just a normal work friendship. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or jealousy, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right to point it out. However, if the author is following the same boundaries as his girlfriend's with her ex, then it's fair for him to feel upset. \n\nThe author's question is about whether he's in the wrong for pointing out the double standard. If the girlfriend's ex is a close friend and the author's coworker is just a colleague, maybe there's a difference in the nature of the friendships. But if the author is being honest about his intentions and there's no actual wrongdoing, then it's reasonable for him to express his feelings. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to address the inequality. However, the way he brings it up matters. If he's accusatory, it might escalate the issue. But if he's trying to communicate his feelings calmly, it's a valid approach. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the double standard, especially since he's maintaining appropriate boundaries with the coworker and hasn't acted on any romantic intentions.\n"
