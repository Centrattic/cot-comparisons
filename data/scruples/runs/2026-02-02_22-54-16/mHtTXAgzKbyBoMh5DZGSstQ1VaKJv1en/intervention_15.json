He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend being upset when she saw him talking to a female coworker, and the author is upset because his girlfriend still talks to her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally about non-romantic stuff. The author has a female coworker he's friends with for work reasons, and the girlfriend got mad after seeing them talking. The author is questioning the double standard here.\n\nNow, the main issue is about perceived double standards in relationships. The girlfriend is allowed to be friends with her ex, but the author isn't allowed to be friends with his coworker. The author is trying to draw a parallel here. \n\nBut wait, there's a difference between a past romantic relationship and a current friendship. The ex and the coworker are different in that the ex is someone the girlfriend had a relationship with, which might carry more emotional weight. However, the author never made moves on the coworker and only interacts with her for work. The girlfriend's ex lives far away and they don't communicate often. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because if his girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with her ex, he might feel it's unfair to be restricted from being friends with someone else, even if the situations aren't exactly the same. But does that make him in the wrong? \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or jealousy, not necessarily the coworker being a problem. The author bringing it up is about addressing the inconsistency, which is reasonable. However, timing and how it's presented matter. If he brings it up in a confrontational way, that could be an issue. But the author is thinking about it thoughtfully, not acting out in anger.\n\nAlso, the fact that the coworker works with him and the ex lives far away adds context. The author's friendship with a coworker is more regular and part of his daily life, which might be why it feels more intrusive. But if the girlfriend's ex is just a distant contact, maybe the author's concern is valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's pointing out a double standard, which is a legitimate concern. However, how he handles the situation is important. If he's approaching it calmly and with the intention to discuss the relationship dynamics, then he's not in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
