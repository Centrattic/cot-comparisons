He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who gets upset seeing him chatting with a female coworker, but he's upset because she's friends with her ex. \n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship and wants to address what he sees as double standards. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, and they talk occasionally about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker, A, is someone he's been friends with since work, only for work reasons, and he's never made a move on her. \n\nThe girlfriend got angry when she saw them talking during lunch, but the author is questioning why she can have a friendship with an ex, which is more intimate (since they used to have a sexual relationship), while he can't even have a platonic friendship with a coworker. \n\nSo, the author is pointing out a possible inconsistency in her behavior. The key here is whether it's fair for the girlfriend to be upset about his friendship with A when she's friends with her ex. If the ex's relationship is past and the friendship is just about mutual friends and home, maybe that's different from the author's current friendship with a coworker. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything inappropriate with A, just work-related chatting. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if the author isn't violating any agreed-upon boundaries. The author's intention is to call out the double standard, which might be valid if there's no real issue with her ex but there's an issue with his coworker. \n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend's ex is still a sensitive topic, or maybe there's more to the ex situation that isn't mentioned. But based on the information given, the author's actions don't seem wrong. He's pointing out a fairness issue in the relationship. So, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
