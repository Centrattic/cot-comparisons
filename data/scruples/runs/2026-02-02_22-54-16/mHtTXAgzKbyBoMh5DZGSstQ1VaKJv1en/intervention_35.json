He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend is friends with her ex, which he's okay with. The ex lives a few hours away and they talk about home stuff and mutual friends. The problem comes when the author's girlfriend sees him chatting with a female coworker, A, during lunch. She gets upset, and the author feels that it's unfair because he's not doing anything wrong compared to her talking to her ex. He's considering bringing this up to her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did anything wrong. The coworker is just a work friend, and he's never made any romantic moves on her. He only has her number for work reasons. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is friends with her ex, which the author didn't mind before. The key issue here is the double standard the author is pointing out. The girlfriend is upset about a harmless work friendship, while she herself has a friendship with an ex that the author is okay with.\n\nThe author's reaction is to question this inconsistency. He's not doing anything that's comparable to his girlfriend's actions. The ex situation is different because it's a past relationship, and the ex isn't around much. The coworker is a current, platonic friend. The author isn't in a position where he's engaging in anything that would be a problem, so pointing out the unfairness seems reasonable.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something about the context I'm missing. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity, not necessarily the actions themselves. The author is right to feel that if his friendship with a coworker is causing her distress, there might be an issue with her perception rather than his actions. However, he should also consider whether there's a valid reason for her reaction. Maybe the coworker's behavior is different from the ex's, or there's some history that makes this a problem.\n\nBut according to the description, the coworker is just a work friend, and the ex is a distant former partner. The author isn't doing anything that's equivalent to being in a relationship with an ex. So the girlfriend's reaction is based on an unfair comparison. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. He's highlighting a double standard, which is a legitimate point to make in a discussion about relationship boundaries and mutual respect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
