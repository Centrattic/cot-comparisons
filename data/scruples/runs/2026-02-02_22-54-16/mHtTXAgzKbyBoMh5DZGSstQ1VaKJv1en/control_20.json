He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend being upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker. The author then confronts her about her own friendship with an ex.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend and her ex talk about mutual friends and hometown stuff, which the author doesn't mind. But when the author is seen chatting with a female coworker he's known since starting the job, the girlfriend gets angry. The author feels it's hypocritical because his girlfriend is friends with her ex, and he's never had romantic intentions towards the coworker.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is wrong to point out the hypocrisy. From a relationship standpoint, jealousy and trust are important. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on insecurity, possibly projecting her own feelings onto the author. The author hasn't done anything wrong by having a platonic friendship, especially since he's never acted on any romantic interest with the coworker. \n\nHowever, the author's approach to confronting her might affect the situation. Bringing up hypocrisy could be seen as valid if the girlfriend's rules about relationships are double standards. But the way he does it matters. If he's accusatory, it might escalate tension. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not the method of confrontation.\n\nThe key here is that the author is pointing out an inconsistency in the girlfriend's behavior. If she's allowed to maintain a close relationship with her ex while he's not allowed to have a friendly co-worker, that's a double standard. The author isn't violating any agreed-upon boundaries here. The female coworker isn't a current romantic interest, and there's no indication of any inappropriate behavior from the author.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the hypocrisy. The answer should be B.\n"
