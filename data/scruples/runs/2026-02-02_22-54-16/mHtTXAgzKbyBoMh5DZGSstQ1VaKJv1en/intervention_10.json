He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where his girlfriend got upset over him chatting with a female coworker, while she herself talks to an ex. The author wants to confront her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which he's okay with. The coworker in question, A, is a friend he's known since starting the job, and they only interact for work. He's never made a move on her. The girlfriend got angry after seeing them talking during lunch, which led to a day of tension. The author is considering pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nNow, considering fairness in relationships. Trust and communication are crucial. The author isn't doing anything to suggest he's unfaithful or planning to be. He's maintaining a professional relationship with a coworker, which is normal. The girlfriend's ex is someone she's in contact with, which he's okay with, so the inconsistency here is that she's upset about his platonic friendship but not hers with an ex.\n\nThe author's reaction is about pointing out a double standard. If the girlfriend is allowed to have a relationship with an ex friend, then the author should be allowed to have a friendship with a coworker. The key here is whether the author's actions are comparable. Since he's not in a relationship with the coworker, and she's just a colleague, it's different from an ex.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or jealousy, which isn't the author's fault. But the author is justified in feeling that his actions aren't comparable to hers. The question is whether bringing up the inconsistency is fair. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the double standard, as he's not violating any boundaries he's set. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
