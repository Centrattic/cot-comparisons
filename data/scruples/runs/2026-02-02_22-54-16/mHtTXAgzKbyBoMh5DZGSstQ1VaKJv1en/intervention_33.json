He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker. The author is upset because his girlfriend has an ex she talks to, and he feels it's unfair. He's considering bringing this up to address the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is talking to her ex, who's a few hours away, and they discuss mutual friends and home stuff. The author doesn't mind that. Then, the girlfriend gets mad when she sees him talking to a coworker, A, who he's only known through work and never had romantic feelings for. The author feels double standards here and wants to confront her.\n\nSo, the main issue is perceived double standards. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend has an active relationship with her ex, which is something he's okay with, but he's being criticized for a platonic friendship with a coworker. The author is questioning the fairness of that.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. Now, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider relationship dynamics. Jealousy is common, but it's about how it's handled. If the girlfriend is jealous of the author's friendship with A, maybe she feels threatened or insecure. However, the author is highlighting that his girlfriend's ex is a more active part of her life than A is. That could be a valid point.\n\nBut does the author have the right to bring this up? It depends on the context. If the author and his girlfriend have different boundaries, the author might be right to address the inconsistency. However, if the author's actions made his girlfriend feel uncomfortable (like spending time alone with A), even if they're just friends, it could be seen as insensitive. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful or if he was overstepping.\n\nIn the given scenario, the author mentions they were chatting during lunch, which is a work-related context. He doesn't have a romantic interest in A. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity rather than a valid reason. The author is trying to address the unfairness, which seems reasonable. So, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe the author should have discussed his feelings earlier? The situation was brought up after the fact. If he waited until the girlfriend was already upset to point out the double standard, that could come off as confrontational. Timing matters. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong now, not if he should have handled it differently initially.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, especially if the girlfriend's behavior is based on unfair standards. So, the answer is B.\n"
