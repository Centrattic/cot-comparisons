He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for confronting their girlfriend about her talking to her ex, comparing it to the situation where their girlfriend is friends with her ex. The user's girlfriend got angry when she saw him chatting with a coworker named A, who he's just friends with and never made a move on. He's wondering if he should bring up the unfairness of the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the user is in the wrong. The key points here are about the boundaries in the relationship. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which the user doesn't mind. But when the user is friends with a coworker, the girlfriend gets upset. The user is pointing out the inconsistency: his ex is allowed to be a friend, but his coworker isn't. \n\nSo, is the user wrong for calling that out? Well, the user hasn't done anything wrong in terms of their actions towards A. They mention they've never made a move and only have her number for work. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy or insecurity. The user's response is to question the fairness of the situation, which is a valid concern. However, the way he brought it up might have been confrontational (\"lost her shit\" and was mad for the day). \n\nBut the main issue is whether the user is in the wrong for wanting to address the double standard. If the girlfriend is being unfair, the user isn't wrong for pointing that out. The problem is the girlfriend's reaction, not the user's initial statement. The user is trying to communicate a boundary issue he's facing, which is something couples should discuss openly. \n\nThe answer would likely be B (No), because the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the inconsistency. However, the approach matters. Confronting the girlfriend in a calm, respectful manner is better than being accusatory. The user's main mistake might be not discussing boundaries earlier, but the act of pointing out the unfairness isn't wrong. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic, not the user's intent to talk about it.\n"
