He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend.\n\nSo the situation is that the author's girlfriend gets upset because she sees him talking to a female coworker, A. The author mentions that he and A have been friends since he started working there, he used to think she was cute but never made a move, and they only have her number for work reasons. The girlfriend, on the other hand, talks to her ex a lot, even though he's a few hours away, and they discuss mutual friends and stuff from back home.\n\nThe author confronted his girlfriend about this double standard, pointing out that she can be friends with her ex, but he can't even be friends with a coworker who's never been a romantic interest. Now he's considering bringing it up again because he feels it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's reaction and the author's response. The girlfriend got upset over a coworker friendship, while she herself maintains a relationship with her ex. The author is pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nThe question is about fairness. The author isn't doing anything romantic with A; it's a platonic work friendship. The girlfriend's ex, however, is someone she has a history with, even if they aren't in constant contact. But the author is being held to a higher standard here\u2014his friendship is being judged more harshly than her ex's.\n\nIn relationships, jealousy can lead to unfair comparisons. The author isn't crossing any boundaries by talking to a coworker, especially since there's no romantic intent. The girlfriend's ex, even if they see him less, might naturally have a different dynamic. But the author's actions aren't similar enough to be a direct comparison. The problem here is the girlfriend's reaction and the author's response to it.\n\nThe author's response\u2014pointing out the inconsistency\u2014seems reasonable. It's about addressing the double standard. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is being fair and just pointing out the unfairness, then he's not in the wrong. But if he's using the girlfriend's past as a way to justify his own behavior, that might be problematic. But in this case, it seems more like he's highlighting an inconsistency.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's addressing a fair concern about double standards in their relationship. However, the way he brings it up could affect how it's perceived. If he's confrontational or using it to accuse, that could be an issue, but the scenario as described suggests he's trying to resolve the issue by pointing out the inconsistency.\n"
