A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker named A. The author mentions that his girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly, which he doesn't mind. The girlfriend got mad, and the author is considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with and they talk about home, mutual friends, etc. The author's coworker A is just a work friend; he hasn't made any moves on her and only has her number for work. The girlfriend got upset seeing them talk during lunch, leading the author to question the fairness of her reaction.\n\nThe author is asking if he's wrong for wanting to point out the double standard. So, is the author in the wrong? From the description, he didn't do anything inappropriate with A. He's maintaining a professional relationship, while his girlfriend has an ongoing connection with her ex. The author's main issue is the perceived inconsistency in how their relationships are handled.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy, but the author is trying to address the unfairness. However, the author's response was to confront her after she was upset, which might come off as using the situation to turn the tables. The key here is whether the author's actions were retaliatory or if they're valid in pointing out the double standard.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's ex is someone she had a past relationship with, which is different from the author's work friend. But if the author's interactions with A are purely professional and the girlfriend's interactions with her ex are more personal and ongoing, maybe there's a valid point in the author's argument. However, relationships often have nuances, and what one person considers a harmless conversation, the other might see as a boundary issue.\n\nThe author might be in the right to express his feelings, but the way he frames it could be seen as using the situation to call her out rather than addressing his own boundaries first. Maybe he should have addressed his concerns earlier rather than waiting for her to get upset. Also, bringing it up after the fact might come off as manipulative if he's using his ex's situation to justify his actions.\n\nBut if the author's actions with A are genuinely innocent and professional, then pointing out the inconsistency isn't wrong. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to highlight the double standard. Given that he didn't cross any lines with A, and his girlfriend's ex is a different context, the author might be justified. However, the approach of using her ex's situation to justify his own could be problematic if it's more about retaliation than addressing his own feelings.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were a fair response to a real double standard or if he's using it as a way to deflect from his own possible issues. If the author's relationship with A is purely professional and the girlfriend's relationship with her ex is more than just friendly, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author's actions were more about turning the tables rather than addressing his own feelings, maybe he's in the wrong. However, based on the information given, the author seems to be in the right because he's pointing out a legitimate inconsistency without acting inappropriately.\n"
