He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset about her seeing him talking to a female coworker, while the girlfriend herself talks to her ex. The author is considering bringing up this inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which the author isn't bothered by. Then, when the author is seen talking to a coworker he's just friends with, she gets upset. The author feels this is hypocritical because he hasn't even asked the coworker out, and the ex is someone she was in a relationship with. \n\nSo, the key points are: mutual friends vs. past romantic relationships. The author's coworker is just a friend, while the ex was a romantic partner. Even if the ex lives far away and talks less, the fact that they were in a relationship might make the current girlfriend more sensitive. \n\nThe author is pointing out the inconsistency. But does that mean he's in the wrong? Well, he's in a committed relationship, so maybe he should be aware that any interaction with someone of the opposite sex could be misinterpreted, even if innocent. However, he hasn't done anything wrong\u2014no flirting, no moving on. The coworker is just a friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or past issues. Her ex was a romantic partner, so she might feel differently about that relationship compared to her friend's ex. The author's point is valid about inconsistency, but relationships often involve different dynamics. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's not doing anything wrong by being friends with a coworker. The issue is more about the girlfriend's reaction and her need to address her own insecurities. The author is right to feel that the double standard is unfair. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
