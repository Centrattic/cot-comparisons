He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on their girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is upset because she saw the author chatting with a female coworker. The author points out that the girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly, which he doesn't mind. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, and they still talk about mutual friends and home things. The author is friends with a coworker, has never made a move, and only has her number for work. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting, even though the author hasn't done anything inappropriate. The author feels it's unfair because his girlfriend can be friends with an ex but he can't be friends with a coworker.\n\nSo, the key points here are about double standards. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend is allowed to have a close relationship with an ex, but he's being criticized for being friendly with a coworker. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with a coworker, especially since there's no romantic or inappropriate behavior. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity, not on the author's actions. The author's response is to highlight the inconsistency, which is a fair point. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because he's not violating any rules. He's addressing a double standard. The girlfriend's behavior might be the issue here. However, communication is key in relationships. The author is considering bringing it up again, which is a reasonable approach to address the imbalance. \n\nSo, based on the analysis, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
