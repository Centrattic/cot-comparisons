He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. \n\nSo, the author's girlfriend talks to her ex regularly, which the author doesn't mind. The ex is a few hours away, and their conversations are about mutual friends and home stuff. Then there's a coworker, A, who the author has been friends with since starting the job. The author never pursued A romantically, only has her number for work, and they haven't met outside of work. \n\nThe girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got upset, leading to a day of anger. The author then confronted her about the double standard, questioning why the girlfriend can be friends with her ex (who they're intimate with) but he can't even be friends with a coworker he never dated. The author is considering bringing this up again and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main issue here is perceived double standards in relationships. The girlfriend is okay with her ex, who is a past romantic partner, but not with the author's friendship with a coworker. The author is upset because their situation is different: the ex is a former romantic partner, while A is just a work friend with no romantic history.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or insecurity, even if the ex is no longer a romantic partner. However, the author's situation with A is more about a platonic friendship with no romantic intent. The author isn't hiding the friendship, and there's no indication of inappropriate behavior. The girlfriend's ex is a past relationship, which can sometimes be more sensitive because of the history.\n\nBut the author's approach to addressing this is confrontational. Bringing up the double standard directly might escalate the conflict. However, the core issue is about fairness and communication. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that their actions are being unfairly judged, especially since their behavior with A is innocent and within professional boundaries. The girlfriend's ex, on the other hand, is a past relationship, which is a different dynamic. \n\nThe key here is that the author isn't engaging in any behavior that's comparable to the girlfriend's ex situation. The author's friendship with A is purely professional and hasn't crossed into romantic territory. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on personal insecurities rather than the actual behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, but the way they approach it matters. However, based on the facts given, the author's actions don't cross any lines, so the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
