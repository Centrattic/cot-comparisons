He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend is friends with her ex, who lives a few hours away and they talk about mutual friends and stuff. The author doesn't mind that. Then there's a coworker, A, who the author has been friends with since starting the job. A is nice, and the author used to think she was cute but never made a move. They only have her number for work reasons. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got mad. The author is upset because he feels it's hypocritical since the girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't be friends with a coworker he's never even dated.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The girlfriend's ex is a long-distance friend, and they don't talk often. The author doesn't have a problem with that. The coworker situation is different: the author has a friendly relationship with a coworker, but it's strictly work-related. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on jealousy or insecurity, not on any actual infidelity or inappropriate behavior from the author. The author is pointing out the double standard, which is a valid point.\n\nIs there any wrongdoing from the author? The author didn't make a move on the coworker, only had work-related contact. The girlfriend's anger might stem from her own insecurities rather than any real issue. The author is addressing the hypocrisy, which is fair. He's not doing anything that his girlfriend is doing with her ex. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The problem lies with the girlfriend's overreaction. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
