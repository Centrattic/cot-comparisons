He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who gets upset because her partner is talking to a former lover, but when the author chats with a female coworker, his girlfriend gets mad. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair and wants to confront her about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally about non-dating topics. The author, on the other hand, has a female coworker who's just a friend, and their interaction is only during work breaks. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. \n\nThe key point is about perceived double standards. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend can have a friendship with an ex, but he can't even have a friendly coworker. The issue here is whether the author's actions are justified. Since the coworker isn't a romantic interest and they only interact at work, the author isn't doing anything wrong. The girlfriend's anger seems based on jealousy or insecurity, not on any actual wrongdoing by the author. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. He's pointing out an inconsistency in how his girlfriend is treating both situations. The ex is discussed as a past relationship, but the coworker is a current, platonic friend. The author hasn't done anything to breach trust. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
