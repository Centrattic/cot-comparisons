He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset about him chatting with a female coworker during lunch. The author mentions that the coworker is just a friend from work, and he never made any moves on her. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is friends with her ex, who she used to be in a relationship with, and they don't see each other often.\n\nSo the author is basically pointing out a double standard. His girlfriend is upset about a harmless work friendship, while she's allowed to have a friendship with someone she used to be intimate with. The author's point is that it's unfair. Now, the user thinks the author isn't wrong and wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if there's actually a double standard here. The key points are: the ex is someone the girlfriend used to be in a relationship with, which is different from a current coworker. Even if the coworker is just a friend, the author's girlfriend might feel jealous because the coworker is someone new in her partner's life. But the author is highlighting that his girlfriend's ex is someone she's had a past relationship with, and yet she's allowed to talk to him, while he can't even have a platonic friendship with a coworker.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for pointing this out? The author is trying to address the inconsistency. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or jealousy. The author's action was to confront this, which could be seen as fair because he's calling out the unfairness. However, maybe the author is overstepping if he's trying to control his girlfriend's actions. But the main issue is the double standard.\n\nThe coworker situation is different from an ex. The author's coworker isn't someone he's had a relationship with, so the girlfriend's jealousy might be misplaced. The author is pointing out that his friendship with a coworker is not the same as the girlfriend's friendship with her ex, but in a way, both are just friends. However, the past romantic history with the ex makes it more sensitive. \n\nBut the author is allowed to be friends with coworkers. The girlfriend's ex is a different case because the relationship is over, so maybe the author's girlfriend shouldn't be as concerned about that. Still, the author is highlighting that there's an inconsistency. \n\nI think the author is justified in pointing out the unfairness. He's not in the wrong for addressing the double standard. The key is whether the friendship with the coworker is appropriate. If the author is just being a friend, then the girlfriend's reaction is unwarranted. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
