He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who gets upset when she sees him talking to a female coworker. But he's okay with her talking to her ex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which he's fine with. The ex lives a few hours away, and they discuss things like mutual friends and home stuff. Then, when the author is talking to his coworker A during lunch, the girlfriend gets mad. The author argues that it's unfair since she can be friends with her ex but he can't be friends with a colleague he's never even seen outside of work.\n\nSo, the main issue is about perceived double standards. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend's behavior with her ex is being allowed by him, but he's being criticized for interacting with a coworker. The author feels it's hypocritical.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants a second opinion. \n\nI should consider if the author's actions are problematic. He mentions that the coworker is a friend he's known since he started the job. They talk during lunch, which is common. He hasn't made any moves on her, just work-related contact. The girlfriend's reaction seems overblown because the coworker isn't a romantic interest. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's ex is someone she's had a past relationship with. The author is okay with her talking to him. The difference here might be that the ex had a past romantic relationship, which could make the author's current girlfriend feel threatened or insecure. However, the author is pointing out the inconsistency in how both sides are handling these friendships. \n\nThe author's action of bringing up the double standard is a valid point. It's about fairness in the relationship. If the girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with a former romantic partner, then the author should be allowed to have a non-romantic friendship with a coworker. \n\nThe key factors here are consent and intent. The author didn't make any advances on the coworker, and their interaction is purely work-related. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity rather than the actual situation. The author isn't doing anything wrong by pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nSo, considering these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The conflict arises from the girlfriend's unfair standards, not the author's actions. The answer should be B (No).\n"
