      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's upset because his girlfriend got mad at him for talking to a female coworker, but she's okay with talking to her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy mentions that his girlfriend talks to her ex a lot, mainly about home and mutual friends. The ex lives a few hours away, so it's not constant. He doesn't mind this. Then there's a coworker named A who he's friends with for work reasons. He's had her number for work, never made a move, and they only interact at work. His girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got upset. He then confronts her, pointing out the double standard because she's allowed to be friends with her ex but he can't even be friends with someone he's never dated.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for calling her out. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nHmm. The main issue here seems to be about perceived double standards in relationships. The guy feels it's unfair that his girlfriend can have a close relationship with her ex, but he's not allowed to have a friendly relationship with a coworker. He's trying to address this by bringing up the inconsistency. \n\nBut is there something wrong with his approach? He's pointing out a potential double standard. If the girlfriend is allowed to have a friendship with her ex, even if they are no longer together, then why is he being judged for being friends with a coworker he's never dated? The key factors here are the nature of the relationships. The ex is in a past romantic relationship, while the coworker is a platonic friend. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural or social norm aspect here. Sometimes, people might feel that an ex requires more distance than a current coworker, even if the coworker is just a friend. But the guy argues that the ex is only talked to occasionally about mutual friends and home stuff, so it's not like they're still in a romantic relationship. \n\nThe guy's action was to confront his girlfriend about this double standard. Is that wrong? Well, if the girlfriend felt uncomfortable seeing him with the coworker, maybe there's an underlying jealousy or insecurity there. But the guy's point is valid: if she's allowed to be friends with her ex, he should be allowed to be friends with a coworker. \n\nSo, is he wrong? The main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the situation is indeed a double standard. If the girlfriend's relationship with her ex is considered acceptable, then the guy's friendship with the coworker shouldn't be an issue. However, if the girlfriend's ex is a more sensitive topic (like still having feelings or meeting up more often), but the guy's coworker is just a friend, then the guy's approach might be justified. \n\nBut in the given information, the ex isn't meeting up often and their talks are about shared topics. The coworker is strictly work-related. So the guy's argument seems reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. The answer would be B (No).\n"
