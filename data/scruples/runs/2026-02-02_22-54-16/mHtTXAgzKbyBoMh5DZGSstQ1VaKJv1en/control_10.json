A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend gets upset when she sees him talking to a female coworker, but she herself talks to her ex a lot. The author is pointing out the double standard.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's ex is someone she used to date, and they live a few hours away. They talk about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker, A, was someone he found cute but never pursued. They only interact at work, and he has her number for work purposes. The girlfriend got angry after seeing them chatting, and he's questioning the fairness of her reaction compared to her talking to her ex.\n\nThe key issue here is the double standard. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend has a close relationship with an ex that he's okay with, but he's being unfairly judged for a platonic relationship with a coworker. The author's actions of bringing this up are about addressing the inconsistency in their expectations. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Jealousy in relationships is common, but the fairness of the situation matters. The author isn't doing anything inappropriate with coworker A\u2014just work-related communication. The girlfriend's ex, on the other hand, is someone she had a past relationship with. The author's action of confronting the double standard isn't about being disrespectful but about seeking fairness. \n\nHowever, timing and how it's approached could affect this. If the author brings it up in a confrontational way without considering her feelings, that might be problematic. But the scenario suggests he's thinking about it carefully. The main point is whether the situation he's in is wrong. Since he's not violating any agreed-upon boundaries that he knows of, and he's pointing out an inconsistency, he's not in the wrong for wanting to address it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
