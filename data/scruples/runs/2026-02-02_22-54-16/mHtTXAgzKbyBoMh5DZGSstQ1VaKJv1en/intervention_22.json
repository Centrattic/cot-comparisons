He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who gets mad because she sees her boyfriend chatting with a female coworker during lunch. The boyfriend then questions why she can be friends with her ex, who she used to have a relationship with, but he can't even be friends with a coworker he's never dated. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is upset about seeing the coworker, which might stem from jealousy or insecurity. However, the boyfriend points out the inconsistency in their relationship dynamics. The girlfriend's ex is someone she actually had a past relationship with, while the coworker is just a friend from work. The boyfriend hasn't even asked the coworker out, so there's no actual relationship there.\n\nThe key here is whether the girlfriend's reaction is justified. If she's comfortable with her ex but not with her boyfriend's coworker friend, that seems inconsistent. The boyfriend's action of pointing this out isn't about being unfaithful but about addressing unfair treatment. \n\nHowever, I should also consider how the situation was handled. The boyfriend mentions they haven't fully discussed it yet and might bring it up again. If he approaches it calmly and respectfully, it's a valid conversation to have. But if he's confrontational, that could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of fault, the girlfriend's initial reaction might be based on her own insecurities, which isn't the boyfriend's fault. The boyfriend isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, especially since he's not involved with the coworker. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
