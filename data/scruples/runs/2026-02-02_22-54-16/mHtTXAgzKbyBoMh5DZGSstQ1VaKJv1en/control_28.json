He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who gets upset when the author is talking to a female coworker. The author then questions the fairness of the situation since his girlfriend talks to her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to sometimes, and the author doesn't mind that. But when the girlfriend sees the author talking to coworker A during lunch, she gets upset. The author then confronts her, pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about perceived double standards. The author is arguing that if his girlfriend is allowed to be friends with her ex, then he should be allowed to be friends with his coworker. But is he in the wrong?\n\nLet me think. The author mentions that he and coworker A are just friends, they work together, and he's never asked her out. The girlfriend's ex, on the other hand, is someone she used to date. There's a difference in the nature of their relationships with their respective ex. The ex is a past romantic partner, which might be more sensitive than a current coworker.\n\nBut jealousy can come from different places. The girlfriend might feel threatened by the coworker, even if there's no actual romantic interest. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which could be valid if the rules aren't consistent. However, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is based on her own insecurities or past experiences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for bringing this up? If he had no intention of being with coworker A, then his behavior is different from the girlfriend's ex, who she's already in the past with. The author's argument is about fairness, but maybe the girlfriend's situation is different because exes can be complicated. \n\nI need to consider if the author overreacted. He used the \"turning the tables\" approach, which can sometimes be a defense mechanism. But in this case, if the coworker is just a friend and there's no romantic intent, then the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the double standard. However, it's possible that the girlfriend's reaction is valid due to her feelings, even if the author's behavior isn't inappropriate.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is that the author didn't do anything wrong initially\u2014just eating lunch with a coworker. His girlfriend's reaction is the issue, not his behavior. By confronting her, he's trying to address the unfairness, which is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
