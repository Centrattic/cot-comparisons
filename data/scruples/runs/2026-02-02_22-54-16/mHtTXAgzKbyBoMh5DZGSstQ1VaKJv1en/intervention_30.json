He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker, and he's upset because the girlfriend talks to her ex a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away, and they talk mainly about home, friends, etc. The author mentions he's friends with coworker A, who's nice, but he's never made a move on her. He only has her number for work reasons. The girlfriend got mad after seeing them chatting during lunch. He's upset because he feels double standards in their relationship.\n\nThe key issue is the perceived double standard. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend talks to her ex, but he's not allowed to be friends with a colleague. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling this out.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the girlfriend's ex is a long-distance, infrequent contact, and the author's coworker is a work friend with no romantic intent, then the author isn't doing anything wrong. However, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy, even if it's irrational. The problem is whether the author's actions crossed a line. Since he didn't have any romantic intentions and the coworker isn't a threat, the author isn't in the wrong. He's right to point out the inconsistency. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
