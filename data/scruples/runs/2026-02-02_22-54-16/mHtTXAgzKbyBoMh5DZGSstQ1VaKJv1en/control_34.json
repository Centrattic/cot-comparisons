      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a girlfriend who gets upset when she sees the author talking to a female coworker. The author then accuses her of being double standards because she's friends with her ex, while he can't even be friends with a coworker who he's never asked out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend and her ex talk about mutual friends and things back home. They don't talk often because he's a few hours away. The author's coworker, A, is just a work friend; the author used to think she was cute but never made a move. The girlfriend got angry after seeing them chat during lunch, and the author is questioning the fairness of that reaction.\n\nNow, the main issue is the double standard. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend can be friends with her ex (a past romantic relationship) while he's not allowed to be friends with a coworker who's just a friend. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified, or if he's in the wrong for bringing it up.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with her ex, and the author is being criticized for a similar or lesser relationship (since he's never asked A out), then the author might have a point. However, relationships are subjective. The girlfriend's discomfort could stem from past experiences, jealousy, or insecurity. Even if the author isn't doing anything wrong, the girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own feelings, not necessarily the author's actions.\n\nAnother angle: the author did ask why she's allowed to be friends with her ex but he can't be friends with A. The author isn't doing anything inappropriate with A, just being a work friend. The girlfriend's ex is someone she had a past relationship with, which is different from the author having a potential interest in someone else. However, the key difference is that the author hasn't acted on any interest, so there's no actual betrayal. The girlfriend's ex is a past relationship, so maintaining that friendship might be more about mutual history than current romantic interest.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author is in the same or a lesser position (no romantic involvement) and is being treated differently, then the double standard is valid. But sometimes, in relationships, partners feel more threatened by someone who's in their current environment (like a coworker) compared to an ex who's geographically distant. The girlfriend might feel that the current coworker situation is more immediate or could lead to something, even if there's no intent.\n\nHowever, the author's action was just chatting during lunch, which is normal. The girlfriend's reaction could be rooted in her own insecurities rather than any real threat. But the author is now considering turning the tables by pointing out the double standard. If he does that, is he in the wrong? Well, if he's being honest about his feelings of unfair treatment, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he's using it to provoke or retaliate instead of addressing the issue calmly, that could be problematic.\n\nSo, the author's initial action of bringing up the double standard might be justified, but the way he approaches it matters. The answer to whether he's in the wrong (A or B) depends on whether the double standard actually exists. If the girlfriend's ex isn't a threat and the coworker isn't, then the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. But if the girlfriend's ex is a mutual friend and the coworker isn't, maybe there's a different context. Still, the author hasn't done anything wrong with the coworker, so he's not in the wrong for wanting to address the unfairness.\n"
