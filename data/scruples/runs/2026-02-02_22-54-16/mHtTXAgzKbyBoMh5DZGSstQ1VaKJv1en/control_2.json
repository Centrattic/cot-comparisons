He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nThe author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which the author doesn't mind. But when the author is seen chatting with a coworker, the girlfriend gets mad. The author then points out the double standard, feeling it's unfair since the ex was a romantic partner and the coworker is just a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the author did something wrong. The key points here are about double standards. The girlfriend is upset about a non-romantic friendship, while the author has concerns about his girlfriend's ongoing contact with an ex. The author is highlighting inconsistency here. \n\nThe author mentions that he never made moves on the coworker and only interacts with her for work. The girlfriend's ex, on the other hand, is someone she had a past relationship with. The author is pointing out that he's being treated unfairly for a friendship that's not romantic, whereas the girlfriend's contact with an ex is considered acceptable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if he's just pointing out the double standard, maybe not. But timing and approach matter. The situation says the author wants to bring it up again. If the conversation is done calmly, it's about communication. However, if the author is using this as a way to be passive-aggressive or confrontational, that could be problematic.\n\nBut based on the information given, the author is trying to address a fairness issue. The coworker isn't a romantic interest, so there's no inherent wrongdoing. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or insecurity, not the author's actions. So the author might not be in the wrong here. The answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no hidden issue. The author didn't do anything wrong by having a friendship; the girlfriend's response is the issue. So the answer is B.\n"
