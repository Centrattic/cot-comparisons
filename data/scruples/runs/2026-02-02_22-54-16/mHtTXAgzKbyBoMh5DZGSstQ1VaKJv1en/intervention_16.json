He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend being upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker, while she herself has an ex she talks to regularly. The author feels this is double standards.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend is annoyed and upset when she sees the author talking to a female coworker. The coworker is described as someone the author has known for work, with no romantic advances. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has an ex she talks to occasionally about non-romantic topics. The author feels it's unfair because the ex is from the past, and the coworker isn't a romantic interest. \n\nThe author is considering bringing up this inconsistency to address the perceived double standard. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. \n\nI should consider relationship dynamics. In a healthy relationship, open communication is key. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend has an ongoing friendship with an ex, which the author doesn't mind, but when he has a friendship with a female coworker, it's an issue. This seems like an inconsistency she's not addressing. The author is trying to communicate his feelings and the unfairness of the situation. \n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or insecurity, which is a common issue in relationships. The author's approach could either be constructive or come off as confrontational. If he frames it as wanting to discuss the double standard respectfully, that's different from being accusatory. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. Since he hasn't done anything inappropriate (no advances towards the coworker), and the girlfriend's ex is from the past with no current relationship, the author's stance seems reasonable. He's asking for fairness in how both are treated. \n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own insecurities, but the author is justified in seeking to address the double standard. So the answer would be B.\n"
