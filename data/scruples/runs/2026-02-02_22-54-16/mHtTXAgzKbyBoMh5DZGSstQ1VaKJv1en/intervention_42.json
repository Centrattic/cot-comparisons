He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend being upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker. The author then points out that his girlfriend still talks to her ex, which he doesn't mind, but he feels it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is in contact with her ex, which the author says he doesn't mind. They don't talk often, mostly about home and friends. The coworker, A, is only for work-related reasons, and the author hasn't made any advances. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting. The author is upset because he feels double standards here.\n\nSo, the main issue is the perceived inconsistency in how the girlfriend treats her ex versus how the author is treated regarding his female coworker. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy.\n\nBut wait, in relationships, jealousy and trust are important. The girlfriend might feel differently about her ex because of past intimacy, even if they're just friends now. The author's coworker is a colleague, but if they're spending time together, even if it's just lunch, the girlfriend might feel threatened. However, the author hasn't acted on any feelings towards A and only sees her at work. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are comparable. The girlfriend's ex is someone she had a past relationship with, even if it's over. The author's coworker is a current colleague with no romantic history. The author could argue that it's unfair to be judged for a platonic relationship when his girlfriend maintains a relationship with her ex. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend has different boundaries. She might consider the ex as a friend but still have emotional ties, while the author's interaction with the coworker is more about work. However, the author's coworker is a current employee, and their interactions are in the present. The ex is from the past. \n\nAlso, the author is using this as a comparison to highlight inconsistency. Whether that's fair depends on the specific dynamics between them. If the author never had issues with his girlfriend talking to her ex, but now feels judged for his own interactions, he's pointing out a double standard. The girlfriend might have different reasons for her feelings\u2014maybe she's not comfortable with the coworker situation because it's ongoing and in the present, whereas the ex is a past relationship.\n\nBut the author is also considering bringing it up again. That could be confrontational. However, if he's been upset and wants to address the inequality in their relationship standards, it's reasonable. The question is whether he's in the wrong for calling out the double standard.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's addressing an inconsistency. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her insecurities or past issues, not the actual situation. The author is trying to communicate his feelings and seek fairness in the relationship. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
