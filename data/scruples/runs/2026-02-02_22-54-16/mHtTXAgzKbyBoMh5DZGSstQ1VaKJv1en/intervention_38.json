He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker, A, during lunch. The author mentions that the girlfriend has an ex-boyfriend she talks to occasionally about mutual friends and home stuff. The author is wondering if he's at fault for bringing up the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend is upset about the author talking to a coworker, but she herself has an ex she talks to. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. The coworker is only known at work, and there's no romantic interest. The author is considering calling her out on the double standard.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend might feel jealous, even if the ex is just a friend. Jealousy can be irrational, but that doesn't mean the other person is right to point out the inconsistency. On the other hand, the author is highlighting a potential double standard. If the girlfriend is allowed to talk to her ex, why is the author not allowed to be friends with a coworker? The coworker isn't a romantic interest, and the ex is a past relationship. \n\nBut maybe there's a difference in the nature of the relationships. The ex is from the past, and they don't see each other often. The coworker is someone the author interacts with regularly. However, the author is clear that there's no romantic interest and the coworker is just a friend. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with an ex, the author might feel entitled to maintain a friendship with a coworker. However, people often have different thresholds for what they find comfortable. The girlfriend might feel more threatened by a potential new relationship than by a past one. That doesn't make her wrong, but it also doesn't make the author wrong for pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nThe author's action of turning the tables is about pointing out a perceived double standard. If the girlfriend isn't in a relationship with her ex anymore, it's possible that the author feels the comparison is valid. However, the context of the ex and the coworker might differ. The ex was a romantic partner, whereas the coworker is not. The author might not see the difference, but the girlfriend's reaction could be based on past experiences.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's being honest about his intentions and the nature of his relationship with the coworker, then he's not in the wrong. However, bringing up the ex in this way might come off as confrontational. The author should consider how to address the issue without escalating conflict. \n\nIn terms of answer, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to decide between A or B. The decision hinges on whether the author's actions were justified in pointing out the inconsistency. If the author acted in good faith without being malicious, then B (not in the wrong) is the answer. If he was trying to manipulate or was insincere, then A. Given the context, the author seems sincere and is trying to address a fair issue. So B is the answer.\n"
