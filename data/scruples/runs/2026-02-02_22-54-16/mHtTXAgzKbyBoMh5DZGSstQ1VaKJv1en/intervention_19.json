He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend being upset because the author was chatting with a female coworker, while the author points out that the girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him talking to coworker A during lunch. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to a lot. The author is considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that the ex lives a few hours away and they talk mainly about home, friends, etc. The coworker is just a friend for work reasons. The author hasn't made any moves on the coworker and only has her number for work. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on jealousy, but the author is pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are: 1) The coworker is just a friend, 2) The author hasn't done anything inappropriate, 3) The girlfriend has an ex she's in contact with, which the author doesn't mind initially. But when the author is in a similar situation, the girlfriend is upset.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to insecurity or past experiences. However, the author is pointing out the double standard, which is valid if the ex is a close friend and the author isn't doing anything similar. The author isn't in the wrong if he's being honest and the coworker is just a friend. However, the way he brings it up might matter. If he's confrontational or uses it as a weapon, it could be problematic. But the question is about being in the wrong in terms of actions, not the approach.\n\nSo, the author's actions (chatting at lunch) are appropriate, and pointing out the inconsistency is also reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
