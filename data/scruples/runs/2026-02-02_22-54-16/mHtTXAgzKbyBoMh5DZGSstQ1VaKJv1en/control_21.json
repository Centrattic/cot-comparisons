He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, and the author isn't bothered by that. But when the girlfriend sees the author chatting with a female coworker named A, she gets upset. The author then confronts her, pointing out the double standard. Now he's considering bringing it up again and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The girlfriend's ex is a past relationship, and they don't interact often, mainly about non-romantic topics. The coworker A is just a friend, and the author hasn't had any romantic interest in her. The key issue is the girlfriend's jealousy over a platonic friendship versus her own ongoing communication with an ex.\n\nThe author's action was to point out the inconsistency. The question is whether he was wrong to do so. From a fairness standpoint, if the girlfriend is allowed to have a friendship with her ex, the author should be allowed the same with his coworker. The author isn't doing anything romantic or secretive; he's maintaining a work-related friendship. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or assumptions, not actual wrongdoing by the author.\n\nHowever, relationships often have unspoken boundaries. Even if something is technically fair, the partner's feelings matter. The author might be right to address the double standard, but he should also consider why his girlfriend reacted that way. Maybe there's an underlying issue he needs to address, not just the surface conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not doing anything harmful; he's pointing out a fairness issue. The girlfriend's jealousy is her own reaction, but that doesn't make the author's stance wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B, No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
