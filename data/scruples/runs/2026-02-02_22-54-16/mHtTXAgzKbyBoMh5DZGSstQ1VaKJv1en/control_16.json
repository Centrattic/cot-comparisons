He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend who gets upset when the author is seen chatting with a female coworker named A. The author then questions the girlfriend's double standard because she's allowed to talk to her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend's ex is someone she's in touch with for various reasons, like mutual friends and things back home. The author notices that his girlfriend gets angry when she sees him talking to coworker A, even though he's never made a move on her and they only interact for work. The author then confronts her about the inconsistency, pointing out her own behavior with the ex versus his interaction with A.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about double standards and communication. The author isn't doing anything romantic with A, just friendly work interactions. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is in contact with her ex, which the author initially didn't mind. However, when the author's own behavior is perceived as problematic, it leads to conflict.\n\nI should consider if the author overstepped by bringing up the girlfriend's ex. Did the author have a right to point out the inconsistency, or was it a form of manipulation to deflect blame? Also, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or insecurity, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nThe author's main argument is that there's a double standard: the girlfriend is allowed to have a relationship with her ex (who lives a few hours away and they don't talk often), while the author is reprimanded for a purely professional and non-romantic interaction with a coworker. The author isn't doing anything the girlfriend is, yet he's being criticized. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. However, the way he brings it up might affect the situation. If he's using it to confront her without understanding her feelings, that could be problematic. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong in the situation as described.\n\nThe author's actions (chatting with a coworker for work reasons) are neutral and not inherently wrong. The girlfriend's jealousy might be misplaced if there's no romantic intent. The author's confrontation could be a valid response if he feels the double standard is unfair. However, in relationships, how issues are communicated matters a lot. If the author's approach is accusatory, it might escalate the problem rather than resolve it.\n\nBut based on the information given, the author isn't acting in a way that's unfaithful or inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her own behavior with her ex, which the author is highlighting. So, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. However, whether the approach is the best way to resolve the issue is another matter. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best communication strategy.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
