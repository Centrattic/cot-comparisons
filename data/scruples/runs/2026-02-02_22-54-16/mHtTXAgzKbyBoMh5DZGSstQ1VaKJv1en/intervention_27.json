He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where his girlfriend is upset about him talking to a female coworker, while she talks to her ex. He's planning to confront her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author's girlfriend has a long-distance ex-friend she talks to occasionally. The author has a female coworker, A, who's a friend from work. He's never had any romantic intentions towards her and only has her number for work. When his girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch, she got upset. The author is upset because he feels it's a double standard since his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't be friends with a coworkers who's not even a romantic interest.\n\nNow, the question is about fairness. The author is pointing out inconsistency. The girlfriend is upset about him being friends with A, but she herself is friends with an ex. The author hasn't done anything wrong\u2014no flirting, no romantic advances, just work-related communication. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy or insecurity, not on any actual wrongdoing by the author.\n\nHowever, relationships involve communication and boundaries. The author should consider why his girlfriend is upset. Maybe she's uncomfortable with him being friends with a woman, even if there's no issue on his part. The author is planning to call her out on the double standard, which is fair, but he might need to approach it calmly and understand her feelings.\n\nBut according to the scenario, the author hasn't violated any agreed-upon boundaries. The girlfriend's ex is someone she's in a past relationship with, and she's friends with him. The author's coworker is just a friend, no romantic implications. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The issue is more about the girlfriend's expectations and her reaction. The author is right to address the inconsistency, but he should do so respectfully to maintain open communication.\n"
