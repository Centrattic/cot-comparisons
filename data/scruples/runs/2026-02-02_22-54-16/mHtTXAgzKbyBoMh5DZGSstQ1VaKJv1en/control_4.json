He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend (gf) gets upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker, A. The author mentions that A is just a work friend, they've never been on a date, and he's never made a move. Meanwhile, the gf regularly talks to her ex, who lives a few hours away and they mainly discuss things like home and friends.\n\nThe author is upset because he feels double standards here. He's asking if it's wrong for him to point out this inconsistency. The key points here are about fairness in relationships and how both partners handle friendships with the opposite sex.\n\nFirst, the author didn't do anything wrong by having a female coworker friend. It's common to have friends at work, especially when you've been there a while. The fact that he's never even been on a date with her, and only has her number for work, suggests there's no real issue on his side.\n\nThen there's the girlfriend's side. She's friends with her ex, which is a bit more complicated because exes can sometimes cause issues, especially if the friendship is close. However, she says they don't talk often and it's about mutual friends and home stuff. But the author is pointing out that she's allowed to have a close relationship with an ex, while he's not allowed to have a friendly relationship with a coworker he's never dated. That seems like a double standard.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for pointing this out. The user is asking if they should call her out on the inconsistency. The answer hinges on whether the author actually did anything wrong. Since he didn't have any inappropriate relationship with his coworker, and the ex-friendship of the gf is ongoing, it's the gf who might be acting unfairly. The author is merely pointing out the inconsistency, which is a valid concern. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
