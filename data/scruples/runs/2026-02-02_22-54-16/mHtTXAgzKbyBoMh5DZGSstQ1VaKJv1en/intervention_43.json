He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who's upset because she saw the author chatting with a female coworker. The key points here are the girlfriend's history with her ex and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend talks to her ex regularly, which the author didn't mind before. The author mentions that the ex is a few hours away and they only talk about home and friends. But when the author's coworker, A, is seen chatting, the girlfriend gets upset. The author then questions the fairness of the situation, pointing out the double standard.\n\nNow, considering relationships, trust is important. The girlfriend might feel jealous because the author is talking to a female coworker. But the author is using work-related reasons to have contact with A and hasn't even seen her outside work. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has a past relationship with her ex and talks to him about mutual friends and home. The author is highlighting the inconsistency here.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend's reaction could be based on insecurity, but the author is pointing out a valid double standard. However, the way the author brings it up might come off as confrontational. Maybe the author should have addressed it more calmly rather than turning the tables immediately. But in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't doing anything wrong by having a work-related friendship. The girlfriend's jealousy isn't justified if the author isn't engaging in any suspicious behavior. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
