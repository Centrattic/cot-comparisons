He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend being upset about the author chatting with a coworker named A, while the author is upset that his girlfriend talks to her ex. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which the author doesn't mind. The ex is a few hours away, and they discuss home stuff, mutual friends. Then, the author's coworker A is a friend he's known since starting the job. He used to think she was cute but didn't make a move. They only talk for work reasons, and he hasn't seen her outside of work. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got mad. The author is upset because he feels it's double standards since his girlfriend talks to her ex, but he can't have a female coworker friend. He's considering bringing it up again.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the double standard. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend is allowed to have a friendly relationship with her ex, while he's not allowed to have a friendly relationship with a coworker. The author isn't doing anything inappropriate (no sexual relationship, just work-related contact), but the girlfriend is upset. The author's actions are within bounds, but the girlfriend feels uncomfortable. \n\nIs the author wrong to want to address the double standard? If he's being fair, then pointing out the inconsistency isn't wrong. However, the way he's handling it might matter. If he's using it to provoke or as a weapon, that's different. But based on the description, the author is trying to seek fairness. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity or past experiences, but that doesn't justify the author's actions if he's being unfair. However, in relationships, both parties need to communicate and set boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, but it's important to approach it calmly. \n\nAnswer B: No, the author is not in the wrong because he's highlighting a double standard and isn't engaging in any inappropriate behavior. The issue lies in the girlfriend's reaction and the need for mutual understanding.\n"
