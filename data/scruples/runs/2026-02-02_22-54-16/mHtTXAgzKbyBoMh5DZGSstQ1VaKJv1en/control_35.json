He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pointing out his girlfriend's double standard regarding her ex and his coworker friend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend talks to her ex, who lives a few hours away, and they mainly discuss things like mutual friends and home stuff. The author isn't bothered by that. Then, his girlfriend gets upset seeing him talking to coworker A, even though they're just friends and he's never asked her out. The author confronts her about the double standard, which is the core of the situation.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness and communication. The girlfriend's ex is someone she has a past with, and the author isn't upset about her talking to him. But when the author talks to a coworker (who he's never even seen outside work), she gets angry. The author sees this as unfair and wants to address it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's pointing out a perceived inconsistency in her behavior. He's not doing anything wrong by having a work friend; it's a reasonable friendship. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if the author isn't engaging in anything romantic or even flirtatious. The author isn't doing anything that his girlfriend's ex isn't doing. So, the author is likely not in the wrong here. He's addressing an issue where he feels there's a double standard, which is a valid point. The girlfriend's jealousy in this case might be unfounded if there's no romantic intent. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
