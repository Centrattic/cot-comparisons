He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend being upset because he was talking to a female coworker, while she is friends with her ex, which the author doesn't mind. The author feels it's unfair and wants to confront her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with another woman, even though he's never made moves on her and they only talk for work. The author is pointing out the double standard, comparing her friendship with an ex to his friendship with a coworker. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author mentions that his girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away and they talk mainly about mutual friends and home stuff. The author, on the other hand, has a female coworker he's been friends with since starting the job, and they only talk about work. He doesn't have romantic feelings anymore and hasn't asked her out. \n\nIs there a reason the author is wrong here? Maybe if the girlfriend has a valid reason to feel insecure, but the author is trying to highlight the inconsistency. The key point is the double standard. The girlfriend is upset about his friendship with a coworker, while he's allowed to be friends with her ex. The author's argument is about fairness, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nHowever, relationships require communication and mutual understanding. The author is considering confronting his girlfriend, which is a reasonable approach if he feels it's unjust. But does that make him in the wrong? If the girlfriend's reaction is based on her own insecurities, maybe the author isn't wrong to address it. On the flip side, if the author's actions (chatting during lunch) were inappropriate, that might be an issue. But given that they were just coworkers and there's no romantic intent, it's a different scenario than the ex situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's pointing out a potential inconsistency in the relationship dynamics. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no hidden red flags. For example, if the author had been flirting or making advances, that's different. But he says he hasn't, so it's just a friendly work relationship. Therefore, the girlfriend's reaction might be unwarranted, and the author is justified in addressing it.\n"
