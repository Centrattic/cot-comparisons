He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset about a conversation she saw between him and a female coworker. The author is considering confronting her about the double standard since she talks to her ex regularly. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is upset because she saw the author talking to a coworker, even though they're just friends. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend has an ex she still talks to, which he doesn't mind. So he's bringing up a perceived inconsistency.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the key here is whether the author overreacted. The coworker is just a friend, and they've only interacted at work. The author didn't make any moves, so there's no actual infidelity. The girlfriend's jealousy, on the other hand, is based on a situation where she's talking to an ex who she isn't currently in a relationship with. The author is highlighting this inconsistency, which is reasonable because it points out a double standard.\n\nBut maybe the author's approach could be better. Confronting her in the moment by saying \"I asked her why...\" might have come off as accusatory. However, the situation itself\u2014being friends with a coworker\u2014isn't the author's fault. The main issue is the girlfriend's reaction, not the author's actions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he's the one maintaining boundaries and being upfront. The girlfriend's behavior is the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
