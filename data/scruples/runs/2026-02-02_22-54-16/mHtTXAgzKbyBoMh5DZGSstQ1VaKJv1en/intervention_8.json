He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend. She has an ex she talks to occasionally; they don't see each other often, just about home stuff and mutual friends. The author doesn't have a problem with that. Then there's a female coworker named A, who he's been friends with since starting the job. He used to find her cute but never made a move and only has her number for work reasons. He's never seen her outside of work.\n\nOne day, his girlfriend stops by during his break and sees him chatting with A at lunch. She gets upset and is mad for the rest of the day. The author then questions why his girlfriend can have a friendly relationship with her ex (who she used to be intimate with) but he can't even be friends with a coworker he's never dated. He's considering calling her out on this double standard.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want confirmation. The answer should be A or B. \n\nLet me break this down. The key points are the girlfriend's reaction versus the author's justification. The author is pointing out a perceived double standard. His girlfriend's ex is someone she had a romantic relationship with, while his coworker is just a friend with no romantic history. The author argues that since his coworker isn't a romantic interest, his friendship is different, yet his girlfriend is upset. \n\nIn relationships, jealousy over friends is common. The author's issue is that his girlfriend is okay with her ex, who is a past romantic partner, but not with him having a platonic friendship. The author is trying to highlight that inconsistency. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the girlfriend's ex is truly just a friend and they have no ongoing romantic involvement, then the author's comparison could be valid. However, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own insecurities or different boundaries. The author didn't make any advances towards his coworker, so there's no betrayal. The conflict here is about perceived double standards in social interactions. \n\nIn such cases, communication is key. The author is considering bringing it up again, which is reasonable. If he approaches it calmly and explains his feelings, they can discuss and set mutual boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out his feelings of unfair treatment. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own fears, but the author's actions don't cross any lines. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
