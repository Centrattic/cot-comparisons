He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend talks to her ex often, but they don't see each other much. The author has a coworker named A who he's friends with but never had any romantic interest in. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got angry. The author confronted her about the double standard, since she can be friends with her ex, but he can't be friends with his coworker. He's considering bringing it up again and wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author is pointing out inconsistency. His girlfriend is okay with her ex, who is in a different city and they talk about non-romantic things. Meanwhile, he's friends with a coworker he's never even seen outside work. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy or insecurity, maybe. But is the author justified in confronting her?\n\nI think the key here is about mutual respect and communication. The author isn't doing anything wrong by having a friendly relationship with a coworker. The girlfriend's anger might stem from her own insecurities, not the author's actions. The author is trying to address the double standard, which is valid. He's not being unfaithful; he's just being friends. So if he brings it up calmly, he's not in the wrong. The problem might be more about the girlfriend's behavior than the author's. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
