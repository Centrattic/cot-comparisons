A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on his girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend being upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker, while she herself talks to her ex. The author is upset about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The girlfriend's ex is someone she's \"talked to all the time,\" but the author doesn't mind. However, when the girlfriend sees him talking to coworker A, she gets angry. The author feels it's unfair because the ex is someone she actually had a relationship with, whereas coworker A is just a work friend he's never even gone on a date with. \n\nIs there a double standard here? The girlfriend is upset about a friendship that's strictly professional, while she herself maintains a friendship with an ex. That does seem inconsistent. The author pointing out the discrepancy might be valid. But I should also think about boundaries in relationships. Even if both are friends, the girlfriend might feel uncomfortable with her partner talking to someone else, especially if there's any lingering feelings or if it triggers jealousy. \n\nHowever, the key point is the author's actions. He's using her ex as a comparison. If the ex is a mutual friend from the past, maybe it's different because they're not in a relationship anymore. Whereas, the coworker is someone in the present. But the author isn't making moves on the coworker; it's just work-related. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if there's no actual infidelity or intent. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. He's addressing a double standard. The wrong here would depend on whether the author did something to justify the girlfriend's anger. Since he didn't make moves on the coworker and it's a work relationship, he's not in the wrong for wanting to call her out on being unfair. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
