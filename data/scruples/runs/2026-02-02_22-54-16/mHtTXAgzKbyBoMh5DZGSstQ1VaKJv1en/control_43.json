He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend is friends with her ex, which the author is okay with. But when the girlfriend sees the author talking to a female coworker, she gets upset. The author is considering bringing up the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally about mutual friends and home stuff. The author doesn't mind that. But when he talks to his coworker, who he's never asked out, the girlfriend is upset. The author is pointing out the double standard here.\n\nSo, the key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to call out his girlfriend on this inconsistency. The question is about fairness in relationships\u2014whether it's reasonable for the girlfriend to be upset about the coworker but okay with the ex. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the girlfriend allows herself to have a close relationship with her ex but gets jealous when the author has a platonic friendship with a coworker, that seems inconsistent. The author isn't doing anything the girlfriend isn't. The coworker is a work friend, not a romantic interest. The author even mentions that he used to think she was cute but never made a move, so there's no active pursuit here.\n\nHowever, relationships can be complex. The girlfriend might feel differently about the ex and current partner's interactions. Maybe the ex is someone from her past, and the author's coworker is a current colleague, which might feel more immediate or threatening. But that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The author is just pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to address this. If the author hasn't done anything wrong, then he's not in the wrong for calling it out. The girlfriend's reaction is the issue here. The author's actions are similar to hers, so if she's upset, that's her problem, not his. \n\nSo the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. He's addressing a double standard in the relationship. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue, not his.\n"
