He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend (gf) has an ex she talks to regularly. The author doesn't mind this because they're just discussing things back home and mutual friends. Then there's a coworker named A, who is a friend. The author used to find A cute but didn't make any moves. They only talk for work reasons and have never met outside of work. The gf saw them chatting during lunch on a break and got angry. The author is now considering confronting her about the double standard, pointing out that she can be friends with her ex (who they had a sexual relationship with) but he can't be friends with a coworker he never dated.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about jealousy and perceived double standards. The author is trying to highlight inconsistency in their gf's behavior. The question is whether the author's actions or intentions here are in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's side, he didn't make any advances towards coworker A. Their relationship is strictly work-related and based on friendship. The gf, on the other hand, has an ex she's in regular contact with. The author is pointing out that their girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a sexual relationship with, yet she's allowed to talk to him, while he's being punished for just being friends with someone he never dated.\n\nThis seems like a classic double standard. The author is trying to address the inequality in how their relationship boundaries are enforced. The question is whether bringing up this inconsistency is fair or if the author is overstepping.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with a coworker, especially since there's no romantic history between them. The girlfriend's jealousy might be unfounded if there's no actual threat to the relationship. The author's decision to confront this could be a healthy way to address the issue, promoting mutual understanding and setting clear boundaries.\n\nHowever, the author should consider how to approach this without being confrontational. The main issue here is the girlfriend's reaction, which might be rooted in her own insecurities rather than the actual actions of the author. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to discuss the double standard. He's trying to address a problem that affects the relationship's balance.\n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He's highlighting a fairness issue in the relationship.\n"
