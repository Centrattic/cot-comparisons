He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The author's girlfriend talks to her ex a lot, which he's okay with. Then there's a coworker, A, who he's friends with but hasn't made any moves on. The girlfriend got mad when she saw them talking during lunch, and the author is upset because he feels it's double standards. He's considering confronting her about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's issue is about perceived double standards. The girlfriend is allowed to be friends with her ex, but the author isn't allowed to be friends with a coworker. The key points here are the nature of the relationships and the context of the interactions.\n\nThe ex and girlfriend presumably have a history, and they live a few hours apart, so maybe their communication is more about maintaining a past connection. The coworker, on the other hand, is someone the author works with, so their friendship is in a different context. The author hasn't made any romantic moves on the coworker, and the coworker isn't someone he's interested in romantically anymore. The fact that he's friends with her for work-related reasons is important because it's a professional setting.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity, even if there's no actual reason for it. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in their relationship boundaries. If the girlfriend is comfortable having a friendly relationship with her ex, why isn't the author allowed to have a friendly relationship with a coworker? The author isn't doing anything to cross the line, so why is the girlfriend upset?\n\nHowever, relationships often involve mutual respect and communication. The author is considering confronting her again. If the girlfriend's jealousy is causing problems, it's important to address it, but the approach matters. The author might need to discuss with her why she's upset and ensure that both are on the same page about boundaries.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't doing anything wrong by having a friendly relationship with a coworker, especially since there's no romantic intent. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her own feelings, which might not be justified. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to point out the double standard. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
