He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend is friends with her ex, which he's okay with. The ex lives a few hours away and they don't talk much. The main issue comes when the author's girlfriend sees him chatting with a female coworker, A, and gets angry. The author is upset because he feels it's double standards since his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't even be friends with a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is friends with her ex, which the author doesn't mind. That's a key point. So the author isn't against his girlfriend being in a friendly relationship with her ex. Now, when he's talking to a coworker, even if it's just work-related, his girlfriend gets upset. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here. The coworker isn't someone he's interested in, and they don't interact outside work. The ex, on the other hand, is someone the girlfriend used to be in a relationship with, but they're not interacting in the same way.\n\nThe author is concerned about being double-standarded. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity, but the author is trying to address this by pointing out the unfair comparison. The question is whether he's in the wrong for bringing this up. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author's girlfriend is uncomfortable with him talking to coworkers, he should know that and maybe address it. However, the fact that the author is highlighting the inconsistency suggests that he's trying to resolve the issue by being fair. The coworker isn't a threat in the same way as an ex might be, especially since the author isn't interested in her. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has different boundaries. Even if the author isn't doing anything wrong, the girlfriend might feel insecure. But the author is right to mention the double standard if it exists. It's not about right or wrong in a black-and-white sense, but about mutual understanding and setting clear boundaries. \n\nThe author's approach is to bring up the issue to resolve the unfairness. The answer would depend on how the conversation is handled. But based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
