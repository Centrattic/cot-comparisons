He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker during lunch. The author mentions that his girlfriend talks to an ex a lot, and he's upset about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. The key points are: the coworker is just a friend, they've never been on a date, they only interact at work, and the author has her number only for work. The girlfriend's ex is someone she's friends with, living a few hours away and talking about non-romantic stuff. The author felt it was unfair that his girlfriend could have a close relationship with her ex but he can't have a friendly relationship with a coworker.\n\nThe author's actions seem reasonable. He's not doing anything inappropriate with the coworker. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity, not on the author's wrongdoing. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which is fair. He's not in the wrong for wanting to address the double standard. So, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
