She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to think through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend (gf) has an ex she talks to regularly. The author doesn't mind this because they live a few hours apart and their conversations are about mutual friends and home stuff. Then, the author has a female coworker (A) who he's been friends with since starting the job. He used to think she was cute but never made a move. The coworker is only known through work, and they haven't met outside. \n\nThe incident happened when the gf came by during the author's break and saw him chatting with A during lunch. The gf got angry and was upset for the day. The author is upset about this and is considering bringing up that it's unfair because his gf can be friends with her ex, but he can't even be friends with a coworker who isn't a romantic interest.\n\nThe author is wondering if he's in the wrong (AITA) for wanting to confront her about this double standard.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about double standards in relationships regarding communication with ex-partners versus platonic female friendships. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with her ex, but he's being criticized for a similar or less intense interaction with a coworker.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the girlfriend is okay with her ex staying in touch, but the author is being judged for having a friend, that does seem like a double standard. The author's coworker isn't a romantic interest, they only interact at work, and there's no indication of any boundary-crossing behavior. In contrast, the ex is someone the gf was previously in a relationship with, which is a different context. However, the key here is that the author is not engaging in any behavior that's akin to the ex's relationship with the gf. The author is maintaining a platonic friendship, while the ex was in a past romantic relationship. \n\nBut in relationships, sometimes jealousy can lead to unfair comparisons. The author is in the right to point out the inconsistency if his actions are indeed within the boundaries of what his girlfriend is okay with. However, the way the author approached it might matter. Confronting someone when they're already upset could escalate things. The author might need to approach the conversation calmly to discuss the double standard rather than just \"turning the tables.\"\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's not doing anything he shouldn't be doing (maintaining a platonic work friendship), and the girlfriend is upset over a situation that's not comparable to her own behavior with her ex, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is the girlfriend's reaction being inconsistent and the author wanting to address that. So the answer should be B.\n"
