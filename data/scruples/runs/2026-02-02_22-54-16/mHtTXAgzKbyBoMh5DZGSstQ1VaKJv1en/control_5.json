He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where their girlfriend got upset over them chatting with a female coworker. The author is considering bringing up the double standard regarding his girlfriend's ex. \n\nFirst, the setup: the author's girlfriend talks to her ex regularly, which he's okay with. Then, when the author is seen talking to coworker A, the girlfriend gets mad. The author is upset because his girlfriend can have a close relationship with her ex, but he can't even be friends with someone else. He's thinking of confronting her about this inconsistency.\n\nSo, the main issue here is perceived double standards in relationships. The author feels his girlfriend's behavior isn't being held to the same standard as his. The key points to consider are boundaries, communication, and mutual respect.\n\nThe author mentions that the ex and his girlfriend talk about home stuff and mutual friends. The coworker is just a work friend, and the author hasn't made any moves. The girlfriend's reaction seems out of proportion compared to her own actions. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the girlfriend's ex is just a friend and they don't have a romantic relationship anymore, then there's no real issue there. The author's coworker is also a friend. The problem here is the jealousy from the girlfriend and the author's response. \n\nThe author's plan to \"turn the tables\" by pointing out the double standard might not be the healthiest approach. Confronting a partner about jealousy in a relationship requires careful handling. Instead of using it as a weapon, open communication is usually better. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being friends with a coworker. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her own insecurity or past issues, not the author's actions. However, the way the author handles the situation could affect the relationship. \n\nIf the author is bringing it up to address the imbalance, that's valid. But if it's to retaliate or show that the girlfriend is wrong, that could create more issues. The answer hinges on whether the author is justified in pointing out the inconsistency. Since the situation isn't clear-cut and both have friends of the opposite sex, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address it. So the answer is B.\n"
