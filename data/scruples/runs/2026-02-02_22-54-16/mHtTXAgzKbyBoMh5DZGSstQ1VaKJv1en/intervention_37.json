A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a guy whose girlfriend gets upset because he's talking to a female coworker, while she's friends with her ex. He's considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend talks to her ex, who lives a few hours away and they don't talk often, mainly about mutual friends and home stuff. The author has a coworker, A, who he's friends with for work reasons. They've never dated, and he only has her number for work. The girlfriend gets angry after seeing them chatting during lunch. The author is upset that she can be friends with her ex but he can't be friends with a coworker he's never even seen outside of work. He's considering bringing this up.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The girlfriend's behavior seems hypocritical. If she's allowing herself to have a friendship with her ex, it's inconsistent to restrict his friendship with a coworker. The author isn't doing anything inappropriate\u2014no flirting, no dates. The coworker is just work-related. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or insecurity, but that doesn't justify her being unfair. \n\nThe author isn't violating any boundaries he expects her not to. The main issue is the double standard. He has a valid point in pointing out the inconsistency. However, the way he addresses it matters. If he's confrontational, it might escalate things. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to call her out, not how he does it. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being friends with the coworker. The girlfriend's reaction is the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
