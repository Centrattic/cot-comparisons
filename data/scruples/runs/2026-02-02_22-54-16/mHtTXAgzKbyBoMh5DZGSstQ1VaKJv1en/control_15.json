He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend gets upset when she sees him talking to a female coworker, A. The author mentions that he and A are friends from work, she's nice, they've been friends since he started the job. He never asked her out and only has her number for work reasons. The girlfriend, on the other hand, talks to her ex a lot, and they discuss things like mutual friends and home stuff. The author is upset because he feels double standards here. He called her out on it, and now he's thinking about bringing it up again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away, and they don't talk often. The author's coworker is at work, and they have a friendly relationship. The key point here is about the double standard. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend is allowed to be friends with her ex, but he isn't allowed to be friends with a coworker. That seems like a valid concern.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a difference in the relationships. The ex and the girlfriend have a past romantic relationship, which could be more complicated. The author's situation with coworker A is purely platonic, according to him. However, the girlfriend might feel jealous because the coworker is a woman, while the ex is a man. So, the author is highlighting that his girlfriend's friendship with her ex is allowed, but his friendship with a coworker is not. That's the crux of the issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's being reasonable and pointing out a double standard, then he's not in the wrong. But if he's being manipulative or bringing it up for the wrong reasons, maybe he is. The author says he just wants to call her out because he thinks it's unfair. He didn't act on any feelings for coworker A, just had a friendly relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or jealousy, which isn't the author's fault necessarily.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. He's addressing a valid inconsistency in how his girlfriend treats their relationships. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
