He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker during lunch. The author is pointing out that the girlfriend has an ex she still talks to, even though he doesn't mind it. He's wondering if he's at fault by bringing up the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The girlfriend's ex is a few hours away, they don't talk often, and it's about mutual friends and home stuff. The author has a coworker who's just a friend, no romantic moves made. The author's number with A is for work, and they haven't met outside work. The girlfriend got angry after seeing them chat, and the author is questioning the fairness of her reaction compared to her talking to her ex.\n\nSo, the main issue is the inconsistency in how the girlfriend is handling her ex versus the author's coworker. The author isn't doing anything that mirrors her behavior. The ex is a past romantic partner, while A is just a colleague. The girlfriend might feel jealous, but the author's situation is different. \n\nBut wait, the author is using the fact that his coworker is a woman he used to find cute but never acted on. So, is there a hidden issue here? Maybe the author's approach to the situation is passive-aggressive, like turning the tables. He's not directly addressing his girlfriend's feelings but pointing out her hypocrisy. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the girlfriend's ex is someone she had a relationship with, which is different from a coworker. The author's relationship with A is strictly professional. However, perception matters. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with him being friends with a female coworker, even if it's not the same as her talking to her ex, it's about how the relationship is handled.\n\nThe author might be in a right to address the unfairness, but the way he's bringing it up could be an issue. He's not just expressing his feelings but pointing out her inconsistency, which can come off as accusatory. The key is whether the author's behavior crossed any boundaries. Since he hasn't made moves and the interaction is work-related, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's jealousy is her own issue, but communication is important. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem is the girlfriend's reaction being inconsistent, and the author should focus on open dialogue rather than turning the tables to address it.\n"
