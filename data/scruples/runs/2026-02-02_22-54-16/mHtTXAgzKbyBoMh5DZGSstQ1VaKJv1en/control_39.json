He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend who gets upset when she sees the author talking to a female coworker. The author then questions the double standard, since his girlfriend still talks to her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author mentions that his girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which he's okay with. The ex is a few hours away, and they mainly discuss mutual friends and hometown stuff. Then, the author has a female coworker named A. They've been friends since he started working there, only interact at work, and he's never had any romantic intentions. The girlfriend got mad after seeing them chatting during lunch, and the author is upset because he feels it's unfair compared to her situation.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nThe user is asking for an analysis based on the given situation. Let's break it down. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on jealousy. However, the author points out a double standard: his girlfriend maintains contact with her ex, but he's being criticized for a platonic relationship with a coworker. The author didn't make any moves on the coworker and only interacts with her for work reasons. The girlfriend's ex is a past relationship, but the author's situation is a current coworker who's just a friend.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to insecurity or jealousy. The author's point about the double standard is valid because if the girlfriend is allowed to keep in touch with her ex without issue, the author should be allowed to have a friendship with a coworker. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining a professional relationship. \n\nI should also consider if there's any hidden context. The author mentions that the coworker is only known through work, and there's no history of romantic interest. The girlfriend's ex is a past relationship, but the author's situation is a current platonic friendship. The author is pointing out inconsistency, which is a reasonable thing to discuss in a relationship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It doesn't seem like it. The girlfriend's reaction is based on jealousy but not on any real wrongdoing by the author. The author is trying to address a perceived double standard, which is a valid conversation to have. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
