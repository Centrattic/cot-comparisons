He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend getting upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker, and then the author is upset that his girlfriend can talk to her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author doesn't mind his girlfriend talking to her ex, who's far away and they only discuss home stuff. But when his girlfriend gets mad at him for chatting with a coworker he's never dated, he feels it's double standards. He wants to bring it up again.\n\nSo, the main question is about fairness in relationships. The author is pointing out inconsistency in how the relationship is being handled. The girlfriend is upset about his friendship with A, but she maintains a friendship with her ex. The author argues that since he never dated A, it's unfair to be treated differently. \n\nI should consider whether the author's actions are within bounds. The author hasn't done anything inappropriate; he's maintaining a work-related friendship. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on jealousy or insecurity, possibly from past experiences. The author is trying to address the double standard, which is reasonable. \n\nBut wait, is there a double standard? The ex is a past romantic partner, which is different from a current coworker. The girlfriend's ex might have emotional ties that the coworker doesn't. However, the author is pointing out that the rules aren't applied equally. \n\nThe key here is communication. The author might be correct in feeling that the situation is unfair, but how he addresses it matters. Bringing it up calmly and discussing boundaries could be the right approach. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom the information given, the author hasn't violated any rules. He's maintaining a friendship that's work-related. The girlfriend's reaction might be irrational, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. He's trying to address the inconsistency. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's pointing out a perceived double standard and hasn't acted inappropriately. The girlfriend's jealousy is a personal issue, but the author's actions are within acceptable boundaries.\n"
