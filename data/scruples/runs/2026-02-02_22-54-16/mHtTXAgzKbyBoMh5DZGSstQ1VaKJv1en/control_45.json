He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy whose girlfriend gets upset because he's friends with a coworker. The girlfriend is also friends with her ex, which the guy doesn't mind. The guy is now considering calling out the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend's ex is someone she talks to about mutual friends and home stuff. They live a few hours apart and don't talk often. The guy's friend at work is just a colleague; he's never asked her out, only has her number for work, and they haven't met outside work. The girlfriend got angry when she saw them lunching together, and the guy is upset because he feels it's a double standard.\n\nNow, does the guy have a valid point? The girlfriend's friendship with her ex is different from his friendship with a coworker. Her ex is a past romantic partner, which can be more sensitive. The guy's coworker is just a friend with no romantic history. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy, even if her ex is not a current partner. \n\nBut the guy's approach is to point out the double standard. Is he in the wrong for that? Well, if the girlfriend's behavior is inconsistent, he has a right to address it. However, how he approaches it matters. If he's confrontational or passive-aggressive, that could be an issue. The key here is whether his friend is crossing any boundaries the couple has agreed upon. If there's no prior discussion about relationships with coworkers or exes, then both might be in similar situations, but the girlfriend's reaction is more intense.\n\nBut the fact that the ex is a past romantic partner adds a layer that the coworker doesn't have. The girlfriend might feel more threatened by her ex because of the history, whereas the guy's coworker is just a friend. The guy's argument about double standards might not account for the different nature of the relationships. So even if there's a double standard, the girlfriend's reaction could be based on valid concerns about past relationships. \n\nTherefore, the guy might be right to address the inconsistency, but he needs to consider the context of the ex vs. a coworker. The answer depends on whether the girlfriend's behavior with her ex is acceptable by their standards. If the guy is allowed to be friends with the ex but not with his coworker, that's a true double standard. However, if the ex's role is different, maybe it's not a direct comparison. \n\nI think the main issue is the girlfriend's overreaction without considering the differences between her ex and his coworker. The guy is justified in pointing out the inconsistency, so he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
