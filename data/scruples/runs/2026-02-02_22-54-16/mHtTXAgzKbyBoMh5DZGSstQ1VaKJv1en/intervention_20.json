He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The situation is that the author's girlfriend gets upset when she sees him talking to a female coworker, but she herself talks to her ex a lot. The author is considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly, which the author doesn't mind. The coworker, A, is just a friend from work, no romantic interest. The author has known her since starting the job, only work-related communication. The girlfriend got angry when she saw them chatting during lunch. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair compared to her being friends with her ex.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the perceived double standard. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend has a close relationship with her ex, but she's upset about his friendship with a coworker. The key factors here are the nature of the relationships, the level of interaction, and mutual trust.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything inappropriate. He's just being friendly at work, which is normal. The girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away and they talk about mutual friends and things back home. That's a different context than a current coworker. The author isn't making moves on A, just being a friend. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy or insecurity. The author is trying to address the inconsistency in their expectations. Since the author isn't violating any boundaries (no flirting, no secret interactions), he's probably in the right. However, communication is key. The author should address the issue calmly, explain his side, and discuss boundaries together rather than just bringing up the double standard confrontationally.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for having a normal work friendship. The problem lies in the girlfriend's reaction and possible lack of trust or communication. The author is justified in wanting to discuss the fairness of the situation. So the correct choice is B.\n"
