She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. \n\nSo the setup is that the author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly, which the author doesn't mind. The ex lives a few hours away and they only talk about stuff like home and mutual friends. Then there's a coworker named A who the author has known since starting the job. A is nice, the author used to think she was cute but never made a move. They only have each other's numbers for work reasons and have never met outside work. \n\nThe issue arises when the girlfriend sees them chatting during lunch and gets mad. The author then confronts her about the double standard, pointing out that she can be friends with her ex but he can't be friends with a coworker he never dated. He's considering bringing this up again and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did anything wrong. The key points here are about double standards in relationships and boundaries. The girlfriend is upset because the author is talking to a female coworker, even though they're just friends. Meanwhile, she's allowed to have a close relationship with her ex, which the author initially didn't mind. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything inherently wrong by being friends with a coworker. There's no indication of flirting or inappropriate behavior. The fact that they only have each other's numbers for work and haven't met outside work suggests it's a professional relationship. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy or insecurity. \n\nThe author pointing out the double standard is valid. It's unfair if the rules are asymmetric. However, the way he brings it up matters. Confronting her after she's already upset might not be the best approach. But the core issue is about fairness in the relationship. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the author isn't violating any boundaries he set; the problem is on the girlfriend's side for having different expectations. Unless there's a specific agreement they have about interactions with others, the author is within his rights to have coworkers. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's addressing a valid concern about inconsistency without overstepping. The issue lies more with the girlfriend's reaction and the double standard rather than the author's actions.\n"
