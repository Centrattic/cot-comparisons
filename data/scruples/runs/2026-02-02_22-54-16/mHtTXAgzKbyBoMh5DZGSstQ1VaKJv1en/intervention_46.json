He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend being upset because she saw the author chatting with a coworker, and then getting mad. The author is considering pointing out the hypocrisy since his girlfriend talks to her ex a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally about mutual friends and hometown stuff. The author's coworker is a friend he's known since starting the job, and they only interact at work. The girlfriend got angry after seeing them chat and was upset. The author is now thinking of confronting her about the double standard.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about fairness in relationships. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with a coworker, especially since he's never shown interest in them. The girlfriend's ex, on the other hand, is someone she used to date, but now they just talk about shared topics. The problem arises when the girlfriend reacts negatively to her boyfriend's friendship but not to her own with her ex.\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics. Trust and communication are key. The author isn't being unfaithful or showing any signs of wanting to leave the relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or jealousy, but her ex is in a different category. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which is valid if there's no difference in the nature of the relationships.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a difference. The ex is someone the girlfriend used to date, so even if they're not together, the connection is more intimate. However, the author's coworker is just a friend. The girlfriend might be overreacting, but the author has a point in pointing out the double standard. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's being honest about his intentions and the relationship with the coworker is purely platonic, then no. He's not doing anything to jeopardize the relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is unfair if she's not applying the same standards. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
