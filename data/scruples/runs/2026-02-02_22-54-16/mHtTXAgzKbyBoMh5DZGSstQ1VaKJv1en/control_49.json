He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend talks to her ex frequently. The author doesn't mind this, as they live a few hours apart and talk about non-dating things like home and friends. Then there's a coworker, A, who the author has known for a while but hasn't had any romantic interest in. The author and A chat during lunch, and the girlfriend gets upset because of this. The author is considering confronting the girlfriend about the double standard, since she's allowed to be friends with her ex (who she used to have a relationship with) while the author is being criticized for a platonic friendship with a coworker.\n\nSo, the main issue here is perceived double standards in relationships. The author is pointing out that the girlfriend is friends with an ex (who they had a sexual relationship with) but is upset about the author's friendship with a coworker he's never dated. The author is trying to highlight inconsistency in the rules.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's about whether the author is right to call out the double standard. The girlfriend's reaction seems jealous or possessive because she's with the author now and doesn't want him to be friends with another woman, even if it's platonic. The ex is not a current partner, but the coworker is a colleague and the friendship is work-related. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining a professional friendship with a coworker. The girlfriend's ex is someone she had a past relationship with, so maybe the rules are different. However, in many relationships, there can be double standards where one partner feels more entitled to certain friendships. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for pointing this out.\n\nIf the author is honest about the friendship being platonic and only for work, then he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's jealousy is her issue, but the author is right to address the double standard. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
