He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset about him chatting with a female coworker, while the author is upset because the girlfriend still talks to her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the girlfriend talks to her ex, but he doesn't mind. The ex lives a few hours away, and they talk about mutual friends and things back home. The author, on the other hand, has a female coworker, A, who he's friends with from work. They only talk at work, and he's never asked her out. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting, and the author feels it's unfair because the girlfriend can be friends with her ex but he can't be friends with a coworker.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is about perceived double standards. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend seems to have more freedom in her friendships than he does. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy, even if the author and A are just friends. However, the author is also pointing out an inconsistency in the rules\u2014why is her ex acceptable but his coworker isn't? \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if the author hasn't done anything to betray the girlfriend's trust, he's probably not in the wrong. However, relationships involve mutual respect and understanding. The author's decision to bring up the double standard is about addressing fairness, but he should consider how to communicate this without being confrontational. \n\nThe key factors are: the nature of the relationships with the ex and the coworker, the frequency of contact, and whether there's any actual harm or betrayal. The author's coworker is a friend from work, and there's no indication of any romantic interest. The ex's contact is more established, but the author doesn't mind it. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity rather than actual wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions (merely being friends with a coworker) are wrong. Since there's no evidence of cheating or inappropriate behavior, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's jealousy might be the issue here, but the author is justified in seeking fairness in the relationship's boundaries.\n"
