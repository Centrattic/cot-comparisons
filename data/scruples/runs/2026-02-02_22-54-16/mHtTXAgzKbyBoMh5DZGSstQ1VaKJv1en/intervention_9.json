He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're the asshole for turning the tables on their girlfriend. The main issue is that the girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly, which the author doesn't mind. Then, the girl they work with, A, is a friend they've known since starting the job, and the author never made any romantic moves on her. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got mad.\n\nThe author is upset because their girlfriend is allowed to have a close friendship with her ex, but they can't even be friends with someone they've just worked with and have only interacted at work. They want to confront her about the double standard. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's ex is mentioned as being a few hours away and they talk about things like home and mutual friends. The author's colleague, A, is just a work friend with no romantic involvement. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on jealousy, even though the author hasn't done anything inappropriate. \n\nThe key point is the double standard. The girlfriend is allowed to have a close relationship with her ex, but the author is being restricted from a harmless work friendship. The author points out that the ex is still in their life, which might not be a big issue for the author, but when he has a similar dynamic (but with a colleague they never pursued), the girlfriend is upset. \n\nIn relationships, communication and boundaries are important. If the girlfriend is jealous without a valid reason, that's her issue. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining a work friendship. However, the author could consider why the girlfriend is reacting this way. Maybe she feels insecure or the ex crossed a line. But based on the info given, the author's actions are on the line of work-related interactions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. The real issue is the girlfriend's reaction to a harmless friendship versus her ex, which is a separate matter. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
