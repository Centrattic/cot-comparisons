He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on his girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend being upset that the author is chatting with a female coworker, while she talks to her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally about shared topics. The author is friends with a coworker he's known since starting the job. He used to find her cute but hasn't made any moves, and they only interact at work. The girlfriend got upset after seeing them talking during lunch. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair compared to her ex situation.\n\nSo, the author is pointing out the inconsistency. Is he wrong for doing that? Well, the girlfriend's jealousy might be valid if there were actual grounds, but in this case, the author's relationship with the coworker is purely platonic and work-related. The ex situation involves past romantic involvement, which is different from current friendships. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with the coworker, especially since there's no romantic interest or action on his part. The girlfriend's reaction seems unfair if the ex is just a past relationship and not an ongoing romantic connection. The author is highlighting the double standard, which is a valid point. \n\nHowever, the way he calls her out could affect their relationship dynamics. But the core issue is the fairness of the situation. Since the author is in the right by maintaining professional boundaries and pointing out the inconsistency, the answer is B. He's not in the wrong for addressing the unfairness.\n"
