He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on his girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend being upset because she saw him chatting with a work colleague, A, during lunch. The author points out that his girlfriend still talks to her ex, which he doesn't mind, but she's upset about his friendship with A. He's considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the girlfriend's reaction versus the author's response. The key points here are the double standard and the context of their relationships. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with and they talk about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker, A, is just a work friend; there's no indication of romantic interest from the author. He even clarifies that he only has her number for work reasons and hasn't seen her outside work.\n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy is misplaced if there's no actual romantic activity between the author and A. The author's response is pointing out the inconsistency in her behavior. The question is whether this reaction is justified. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with him having a female friend, especially given her own history, but he's not doing anything wrong, then the author isn't in the wrong. He's highlighting a lack of trust or fairness on her part. However, the way he approaches the confrontation matters. If he's accusatory or confrontational, it might escalate things, but if he's calmly pointing out the double standard, it's reasonable.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author hasn't acted on any feelings towards A and that their interactions are purely work-related supports his stance. The girlfriend's ex is someone she's allowed to have a friendship with, which the author isn't objecting to. Therefore, the author's response is about seeking parity in the relationship's boundaries. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with his friendship, there might be deeper issues of trust or insecurity, but the author isn't violating any agreed-upon rules here. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's addressing a double standard and his actions are within the bounds of normal workplace friendships.\n"
