He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who's upset because she saw the author chatting with a female coworker. The author is then upset because his girlfriend talks to her ex a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author mentions that the coworker, A, is just a friend from work, and they've never had anything romantic. The author's girlfriend, on the other hand, has an ex she talks to frequently. The girlfriend got angry when she saw the author talking to coworker A, and the author is considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for being friends with coworker A. The author didn't make any moves on her, and they only interact at work. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to have a relationship with, but they don't talk often. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in their relationship boundaries.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. If the girlfriend is allowed to have a close relationship with her ex, even if they don't talk often, but the author is not allowed to have a platonic friendship with a coworker, that's a double standard. The author's intention here is to call out the unfairness, which is a reasonable response.\n\nBut I should also consider if there's anything the author did wrong. They didn't have a romantic interest in A, only a work-related friendship. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or jealousy. The author's actions aren't inappropriate if they're just working together and being friends. So, the author isn't in the wrong for having a friendship, and pointing out the double standard is valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
