He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is friends with her ex, which he's okay with. But when the girlfriend sees him chatting with a female coworker he's just friends with, she gets mad. The author is upset because he feels it's double standards. He's considering calling her out on it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author and his girlfriend both have friends of the opposite sex. The author's issue is that his girlfriend is friends with an ex, while he's friends with a coworker. The author is pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are important. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining a platonic friendship with a coworker. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy, even if there's no actual wrongdoing. The author is addressing the double standard, which is reasonable.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should consider why the girlfriend is reacting that way. Maybe there's a history or insecurity there. But the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's not acting on the friendship beyond what's appropriate, and the girlfriend's reaction is the issue, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
