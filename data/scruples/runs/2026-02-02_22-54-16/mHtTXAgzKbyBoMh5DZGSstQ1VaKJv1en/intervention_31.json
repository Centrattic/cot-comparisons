He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation involving their girlfriend and her ex. The author's girlfriend gets upset because she sees him chatting with a female coworker, but the author isn't upset about the girlfriend's friendship with her ex. The author is considering confronting the girlfriend about this perceived double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend talks to her ex, which the author doesn't mind. The ex is far away and they only discuss non-romantic topics. The coworker, A, is a friend the author has known for a while but hasn't pursued romantically. The girlfriend got angry after seeing them chat during lunch. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair given his own situation.\n\nSo, the main issue is the double standard. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with a coworker, especially since he's never had romantic intentions. Meanwhile, the girlfriend's friendship with her ex might be more sensitive. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which seems reasonable. However, bringing up the ex could be a sensitive topic for the girlfriend. The question is whether the author is justified in confronting her about it.\n\nI should consider if the author's actions are in the wrong. Since he's being truthful and the coworker situation is harmless, he's not being unfaithful. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or past issues, but the author has a right to express his feelings about the double standard. However, confronting her might not be the best approach unless handled carefully. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the inconsistency. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
