He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend being upset because her partner was seen talking to a female coworker, while she can talk to her ex. The author is considering pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend's ex is a few hours away and they don't talk often, mostly about mutual friends and home. The author's coworker is just a friend, they've worked together since he started, and he's never made a move. The girlfriend got upset after seeing them chat during lunch. The author feels it's unfair.\n\nSo, the main issue is about perceived double standards. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend has a closer, past relationship with an ex, yet he's not allowed to have a friendship with a coworker. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for bringing this up.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if both parties are treated with the same standards, then the girlfriend's reaction might be inconsistent. However, past relationships can be sensitive. The ex is a former romantic partner, which might have different connotations compared to a friendly coworker. The author isn't doing anything inappropriate with the coworker, just being friendly for work reasons.\n\nThe key here is intent and context. The author isn't flirting or having a relationship, just maintaining a work-related friendship. The girlfriend's ex is a past romantic partner, but they're not currently together. However, some people might feel uncomfortable with their partner interacting with an ex, even if it's just friendship. But in this case, the ex isn't nearby and the communication is minimal.\n\nThe author's action of confronting the girlfriend about the inconsistency isn't inherently wrong if done respectfully. It's about addressing a perceived unfairness. However, the way it's brought up matters. If it's done in a accusatory way, it could escalate tensions. But the author's intention is to clarify and maybe resolve the issue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's being honest about his feelings and the situation, then no. The wrong would be if he were being dishonest or if there were actual impropriety with the coworker. Since he's clear about their friendly work relationship, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's jealousy might stem from insecurity, but the author has the right to express that.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
