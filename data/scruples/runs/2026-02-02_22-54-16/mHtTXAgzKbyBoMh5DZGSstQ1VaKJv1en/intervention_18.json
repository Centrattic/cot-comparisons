He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for turning the tables on their girlfriend. The main issue is about the girlfriend being upset when she saw him chatting with a coworker, A, during lunch. The author mentions that his girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly, which he's okay with. The girlfriend gets mad, and he argues it's unfair because she can have a past relationship but he can't even be friends with a coworker he's never dated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, but they live a few hours apart and talk mainly about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker A is someone he's just friends with for work, and he's never even seen her outside of work. The key here is the girlfriend's reaction to him talking to A, while she continues to talk to her ex. \n\nThe author is pointing out the inconsistency. The question is whether he's in the wrong for calling her out. The main factors are trust and communication. In a relationship, both partners should ideally have mutual trust. If the girlfriend is upset about him talking to a coworker but okay with her talking to her ex, that seems double standards. However, the ex situation might be more complex. Maybe the ex is still a part of her life, but the author's coworker is just a colleague. \n\nBut the author is asking if he's in the wrong for bringing it up. The answer depends on the context. If the girlfriend's ex is a closed chapter and she's not in contact frequently, then her talking to him might be acceptable. However, the author's situation with a coworker is different because they're in a current relationship. But the author hasn't done anything inappropriate\u2014just work-related chatting. \n\nThe author's action of pointing out the inconsistency might be necessary for the relationship to be fair. If the girlfriend is upset over something minor (chatting at lunch) while she talks to her ex, the author is highlighting a double standard. But maybe the girlfriend's ex is a sensitive topic, and the author's bringing it up could cause more conflict. However, communication is key in relationships, so addressing the issue is important.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. The answer should be B (No).\n"
