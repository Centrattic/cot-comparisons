He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend getting upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker, while the author is upset that the girlfriend still talks to her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend talks to her ex, who's a few hours away, mostly about home stuff and friends. The author doesn't mind that, but when his girlfriend got upset over him chatting with a coworker, he felt it was unfair. He's considering bringing up the ex situation to balance things out.\n\nSo, the main issue is jealousy and perceived double standards. The author is questioning if his actions are justified. From a fairness perspective, both partners having mutual friends is common, but it often depends on the boundaries each couple sets. The girlfriend might feel threatened by the coworker because he's in a current relationship, while the author sees the ex as a non-issue because they're not together anymore.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author's argument is about hypocrisy. He's trying to point out that if she can have a past relationship, he should be allowed to have a platonic work friendship. However, the dynamics are different. An ex might have history and emotional ties, whereas a coworker is a current, professional relationship. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity about her current partner interacting with someone else, even if it's just work-related.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be right if the girlfriend's jealousy is inconsistent. But bringing it up in that moment might escalate the conflict instead of resolving it. The key is communication. The author wants to address the double standard, but he should consider the context and emotions involved. \n\nIs he in the wrong? If the author is making a valid point about fair treatment, maybe not. But if he's using the ex as a justification without understanding his girlfriend's perspective, he might be overstepping. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. It's possible the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. The answer depends on whether the author's actions are based on fairness or retaliation. Since he's pointing out a discrepancy, B (not in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
