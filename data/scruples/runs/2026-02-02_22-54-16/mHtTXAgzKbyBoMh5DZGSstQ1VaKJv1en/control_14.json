He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend gets mad at him for chatting with a coworker named A. He mentions that he used to think A was cute but never made any moves, and they only talk for work reasons. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has an ex she talks to regularly about mutual stuff.\n\nThe author is upset because he feels there's a double standard. He's being criticized for talking to a coworker he's not interested in, while his girlfriend can talk to her ex without issue. He's considering bringing this up to point out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did anything wrong. The key points are: the coworker is only for work, no romantic interest, and the girlfriend's ex is a different situation. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy or insecurity, but the author is pointing out a fairness issue. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to address this? If the girlfriend is allowing herself to talk to an ex but is upset when he talks to a coworker, there's a double standard. The author isn't doing anything he's not supposed to; he's just having work-related chats. So in that sense, he's not in the wrong for wanting to highlight the inconsistency. \n\nBut maybe there's something else? Like, maybe the girlfriend has a right to be upset if she feels insecure, even if it's unfair? But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Since the author hasn't done anything inappropriate, and is trying to address a perceived unfairness, he's probably not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
