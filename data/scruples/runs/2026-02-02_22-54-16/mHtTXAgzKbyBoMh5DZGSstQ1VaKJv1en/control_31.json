He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for a situation with their girlfriend. The main points are:\n\n1. The girlfriend talks to her ex a lot, which the author doesn't mind. The ex lives far away and they just talk about mutual friends and home stuff.\n2. The author has a female coworker named A. They've been friends since starting work, but the author never made a move. They only have her number for work.\n3. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting during lunch. The author is now considering pointing out the double standard, since the girlfriend can be friends with an ex but he can't be friends with a coworker.\n\nFirst, the author is pointing out a perceived double standard. The girlfriend's ex is a past relationship, while the author's coworker is just a friendly work colleague. The author didn't have any romantic feelings now and only interacted for work. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy, even though there's no indication the author is doing anything wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for being friends with a coworker. Since the author has never made any romantic advances and the coworker is a friend, it seems legitimate. The girlfriend's issue might stem from insecurity or not trusting the author. However, if the author is using this as a way to point out her past without addressing the current situation, that could be problematic. \n\nBut the main question is about the author's actions. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with a coworker. The girlfriend's reaction is the issue. The author is trying to highlight the inconsistency, which is valid. However, bringing it up in a confrontational way might escalate things. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions are wrong. Since they're just being friends, the answer is likely B (No). But if the author is using this to manipulate or escalate the argument without considering the girlfriend's feelings, maybe A. But based on the given info, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
