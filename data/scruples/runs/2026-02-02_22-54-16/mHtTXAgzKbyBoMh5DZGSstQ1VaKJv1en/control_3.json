He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because they saw him chatting with a female coworker, even though he never had any romantic interest in her. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has an ex she talks to regularly. The author is upset about the double standard and wants to confront her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did anything wrong. The coworker is called A, and he's just friends with her. They only interact at work for work-related reasons. The author didn't make any moves on her and only has her number for work. The girlfriend, however, has an ex she talks to about common things, but the author is upset that his friendship with a coworker is causing jealousy.\n\nThe key points here are about perceived double standards. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend can be friends with an ex, but he can't be friends with a coworker. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to confront her about this.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are important. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with the coworker interaction, maybe she has valid reasons. But the author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with a coworker. The fact that the coworker is a woman and the ex is a man might be causing jealousy. The author is trying to address the inconsistency in how their relationship boundaries are being applied.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting to discuss this. He's highlighting a possible double standard. However, the way he approaches the conversation matters. If he's confrontational, that could be an issue. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for bringing it up, not how he does it. So the answer would likely be B (No), because he's pointing out a legitimate concern about fairness in their relationship.\n"
