He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nSo the situation is: The author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally. The author has a female coworker (A) who he's friends with but hasn't made any romantic moves on. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got upset. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair when his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, even though he's not involved with his coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend is jealous of the author's friendship with A, even though there's no romantic involvement. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, as his girlfriend has a relationship with her ex. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for pointing this out.\n\nI think the main issue is about fairness and communication. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with a colleague. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her own insecurities or jealousy. The author is justified in expressing his feelings about the double standard. However, how he approaches this could matter. If he's confrontational or dismissive of her feelings, that could be problematic. But the act of pointing out the inconsistency in itself isn't wrong. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and based on the information given, the answer would be B (No).\n"
