He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who gets upset because the author is talking to a female coworker, but she's friends with her ex. The author is planning to bring up the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The girlfriend talks to her ex a lot, which the author doesn't mind. The ex is far away, and they just talk about home and friends. Then there's this coworker named A. The author has known her since starting the job, they're friends, and the author never asked her out. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got upset. The author points out the inconsistency: why is the girlfriend allowed to be friends with an ex but the author can't have a female coworker friend?\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Now, I need to evaluate if that's correct. The key here is about fairness and boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy, even if the author hasn't done anything inappropriate. But the author is pointing out a double standard, which could be valid if the rules are applied unevenly.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's main point is that the girlfriend is being unfair. If the ex is a past relationship, maybe the girlfriend still has feelings or the author feels threatened. However, the coworker is just a friend. The author hasn't done anything wrong, but the girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is just being friendly, not flirting or anything. The girlfriend's behavior could be the issue here. The author bringing up the double standard isn't being wrong; it's seeking fairness. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing an inconsistency in the relationship dynamics.\n"
