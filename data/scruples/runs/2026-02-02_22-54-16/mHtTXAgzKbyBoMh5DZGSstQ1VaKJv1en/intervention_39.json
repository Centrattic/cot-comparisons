He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset because he was talking to a female coworker, while she's friends with her ex. The author is considering bringing up the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's gf has an ex she talks to occasionally about home and friends. He doesn't mind that. Then, his gf gets angry when she sees him chatting with a coworker he's never asked out and hasn't seen outside work. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here.\n\nNow, considering relationships and boundaries. If the author and his girlfriend are in a committed relationship, it's normal that each has certain expectations about the other's interactions. The girlfriend might feel jealous seeing him talking to a female coworker, especially if she has a history of being with her ex. But the question is whether her reaction is justified compared to the author's situation.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything wrong by being friendly with a coworker. Since he hasn't pursued a relationship with her, it's just a work friendship. On the other hand, the ex is someone the girlfriend used to be intimate with, which might make her more sensitive about the author's interactions. However, the ex is not around, and they only talk occasionally about mutual topics.\n\nThe author's point about the double standard is valid. If the girlfriend is okay with her ex, who is a past romantic partner, being friends with her, then it's inconsistent for her to be upset about the author's platonic friendship with a coworker. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing this out, as he's addressing a perceived unfairness in the relationship.\n\nBut wait, maybe the girlfriend's jealousy has a different reason. Maybe she's insecure or the author's behavior could be misinterpreted. However, the story says the coworker is only for work, and the author hasn't made any romantic moves. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on her own past, not the author's actions. So the author isn't at fault here. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
