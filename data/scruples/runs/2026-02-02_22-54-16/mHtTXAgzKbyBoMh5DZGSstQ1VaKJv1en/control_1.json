He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting his girlfriend about her jealousy regarding her ex and his friendship with a coworker.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend talks to her ex, who's a few hours away, mainly about mutual friends and home stuff. The author doesn't mind this. Then, his girlfriend gets upset when she sees him chatting with coworker A. He didn't make a move on A and only has her number for work. The author is now considering confronting his girlfriend about the double standard.\n\nSo, the key points here: Is the author's friendship with A a problem? He says they're just friends, coworkers, no romantic interest. The girlfriend's ex is someone she's allowed to talk to, but when the author has a platonic relationship with a coworker, she gets jealous. The author is questioning the fairness of that.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are important. The girlfriend might feel uncomfortable because she perceives A as a potential threat, even if there's no intention. However, the author is pointing out a double standard. The girlfriend's ex is a past romantic partner; it's possible that the nature of their relationship is different. But the author's relationship with A is strictly professional.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if he's genuinely not interested in A and their interactions are purely work-related, then he's not doing anything wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity rather than the situation itself. However, the author's approach to confronting her could affect things. If he brings it up in a hurtful way, that could be problematic. But if he's addressing the double standard calmly, he's justified in seeking fairness.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to discuss the inconsistency. The main issue is the girlfriend's reaction, not the author's friendship. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
