He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker, and he's upset because his girlfriend has an ex she talks to. He's considering bringing up this double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally about home and friends. The author has a female coworker, A, who he's just friends with, no romantic intentions. The girlfriend got angry after seeing them chat during lunch. The author is comparing his situation with her ex, arguing inconsistency.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness and communication. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with a female coworker. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, which is different from the author's situation. The author's action is purely work-related friendship, while the girlfriend's interaction with her ex might carry different connotations, even if they're just talking about mutual friends.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's reaction might be due to jealousy. The author is pointing out the double standard, which is a valid point. If he's not being unfaithful or showing interest in the coworker, her anger could be unwarranted. However, the girlfriend's ex is someone she has a past with, which the author doesn't have with his coworker. So the situations aren't exactly parallel, but the author is trying to highlight the inconsistency.\n\nAnother angle: trust issues. The author's actions aren't deceitful; he has a work-related reason for being friends with A. The girlfriend's behavior might stem from insecurity. The author's response is to confront her about the inconsistency, which is fair if he's being honest about his intentions.\n\nPotential issues: The author should ensure that his communication with A is strictly professional. If there's any ambiguity, that could be a problem. But based on the description, he's clear about not having romantic intentions. The girlfriend's reaction is the main issue here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's being honest and not acting on any romantic interest, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior is the problem. However, in relationships, communication is key. The author is trying to address the double standard, which is a reasonable step. So the answer would be B for No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
