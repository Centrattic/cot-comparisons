He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on their girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend being upset about the author chatting with a female coworker, while she herself talks to her ex regularly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, and they talk occasionally about non-dating related topics. The author has a female coworker (A) who is just a friend and work colleague. The girlfriend got upset seeing them talking, leading the author to question the double standard.\n\nThe author's action here is pointing out the inconsistency. The question is whether that's justified. From a fairness standpoint, if the girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with an ex without issue, then the author should be allowed the same with a colleague. The author isn't doing anything inappropriate, just being friendly at work. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy without a valid reason, especially since there's no evidence of the author having feelings for A or vice versa. The author mentions they never made a move on A, so the friendship isn't a threat. \n\nHowever, it's important to consider communication styles and relationship dynamics. Sometimes, bringing up past issues can lead to arguments. But in this case, the author is addressing a current inconsistency. The girlfriend's ex is from the past, while the coworker is a present concern. The author's action isn't about having feelings for A but about fairness in expectations.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is being truthful and not trying to manipulate, then pointing out the double standard isn't wrong. It's about seeking fairness. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
