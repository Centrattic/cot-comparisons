He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset about him talking to a female coworker, while the author notices that the girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's reaction: she saw him chatting with a female coworker and got upset. The author points out that the girlfriend has an ex she talks to often. The key here is whether the girlfriend's behavior is hypocritical or if there's a valid reason for her being upset.\n\nThe author mentions that he used to find the coworker cute but hasn't made any moves and only has her number for work. The coworker isn't even seen outside work. On the other hand, the girlfriend's ex is someone she's had a past relationship with, which might be a more sensitive topic. People often feel jealous about their partner interacting with someone who was in their past, even if it's just friends. \n\nThe author's response was to confront her about the double standard. But maybe there's a difference between talking to an ex and talking to a current coworker. The girlfriend might feel uncomfortable seeing her partner interact with someone who was attractive to them, even if it's just friendship. Jealousy can be irrational, but that doesn't mean the author is entirely right to call her out on it. \n\nHowever, the author's point is about fairness. If the girlfriend's ex is a current topic, maybe she's allowed to talk about mutual friends and such, while the author's interaction with a coworker is being scrutinized. But the nature of the relationships might differ. The ex was a romantic partner, which could carry more emotional weight than a coworker, even if the coworker is nice. \n\nThe author is in a position where he's trying to address a perceived double standard. But maybe he should consider why the girlfriend is upset. Is it about the coworker being a woman he found cute in the past, or is it about her feeling insecure? Either way, confronting her about her ex might not be the best approach. It could escalate the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not necessarily being unfair if he's pointing out a hypocrisy. However, the context of past relationships versus current friendships might matter. The author might be right to seek clarity, but the method of confrontation could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue, but maybe the way he's approaching it isn't the healthiest. However, the question is whether he's \"in the wrong,\" which is a yes or no. Given that he's pointing out a possible double standard and isn't engaging in any wrongdoing himself, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). But the analysis shows that there are complexities.\n"
