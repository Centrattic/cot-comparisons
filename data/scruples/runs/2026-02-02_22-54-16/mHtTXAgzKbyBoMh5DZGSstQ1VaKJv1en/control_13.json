He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting his girlfriend about her behavior regarding her ex. The situation is that the girlfriend is upset when she sees the author chatting with a female coworker, but she herself talks to her ex regularly. The author is trying to point out the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with and they still talk about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker is just a friend, the author has never made a move on her, and they only interact for work. The girlfriend got angry at the author for being friends with this coworker, which the author sees as unfair compared to her own interactions with her ex.\n\nNow, the author is thinking about confronting her again. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's look at the dynamics. The author is pointing out a double standard. If the girlfriend is allowed to have a friendship with an ex, then why can't the author have a friendship with a coworker? The author isn't doing anything wrong by having a work-related friendship, especially since there's no romantic intent. The girlfriend's reaction is based on jealousy or insecurity, perhaps. The author is trying to address the inconsistency in their relationship boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author is bringing up a valid point about mutual respect and fair treatment. However, the way he confronts her might matter. If he's doing it in a respectful and calm manner, it's justified. But if he's being confrontational, that could be an issue. The scenario doesn't specify the tone, but the act of pointing out a double standard isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's behavior is the problem here, not the author's for wanting to address it.\n\nAlso, considering that the author has a legitimate grievance here, it's reasonable for him to seek resolution. The fact that the coworker is only for work and there's no romantic interest adds weight to his side. The girlfriend's ex is a past relationship, and even if they talk occasionally, it's different from the current ongoing friendship the author has with a colleague. The author isn't violating any boundaries that his girlfriend isn't also doing, but in a different context.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. He's advocating for himself and setting boundaries, which is healthy in a relationship. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
