He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker named A. The author didn't make any moves on A and only has her number for work. He's upset because he feels it's unfair compared to his girlfriend's ex, who she talks to occasionally about things like home and mutual friends. The author is considering bringing this up to his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is actually in the wrong here. The key points are: the author and A are friends from work, they only talk at work, no romantic advances, and the girlfriend's ex is contacted less frequently. The author is pointing out a double standard. But wait, is there a valid comparison here? The ex is someone the girlfriend used to be in a relationship with, while A is just a coworker. The ex's contact is about mutual friends and home, which might be more neutral topics. The author's situation with A could be perceived as a potential romantic interest because the coworker is a woman, and even if they're just friends, the girlfriend might feel jealous regardless. \n\nHowever, the author never asked A out, so there's no indication of a romantic relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own insecurities or past experiences. In many relationships, partners might feel uncomfortable with the other being close to someone of the opposite sex, even if there's no romantic intent. The author's argument is about fairness, but the situations might not be equivalent. The ex is a past romantic partner, which is different from a current coworker. The girlfriend's contact with the ex could be more sensitive because it's a former lover, while the author's friendship with A is more platonic. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're just friends and there's no romantic involvement, then maybe not. But the girlfriend might still feel that there's an issue, even if it's unspoken. The author could be justified in addressing the double standard, but the way he approaches it might matter. He's considering \"calling her out,\" which could come off as confrontational. It's important to consider communication styles. If the author is bringing up the ex's contact to highlight inconsistency, he's not wrong to want to discuss it. However, the fairness of the comparison is key. The ex is a past partner, while A is a coworker with no romantic history. The girlfriend's jealousy might be misplaced, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is at fault for having a friend. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong if they are maintaining a purely platonic relationship with A. The girlfriend's reaction could be based on her own feelings, not the author's actions. So the answer might be B for No.\n"
