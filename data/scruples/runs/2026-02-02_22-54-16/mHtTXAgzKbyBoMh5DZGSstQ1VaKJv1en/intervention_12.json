He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation.\n\nThe situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker. The author points out that the girlfriend talks to her ex often, which he doesn't mind. He's considering calling her out on the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the girlfriend's reaction. The ex is from their hometown, they don't talk often, and it's about mutual friends and home stuff. The coworker is someone the author has known for a while but only as a work friend. The author hasn't made any romantic moves, just a work-related friendship.\n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy is based on the author talking to a coworker, but she's comfortable talking to her ex. The author is pointing out the double standard. So, the key issue here is whether the girlfriend's behavior is unfair given the circumstances.\n\nThe author is trying to address the inconsistency. If the girlfriend is upset about the coworker but not about the ex, that does seem like a double standard. The author isn't doing anything inappropriate, like flirting or having a relationship with the coworker. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her own insecurities or jealousy, not on the author's actions.\n\nHowever, sometimes people react differently based on context. The ex might be a more sensitive topic because of past history, while the coworker is a new situation. But the author's point is valid: if the girlfriend can have a friendship with her ex, why can't he have a friendship with his coworker? The author isn't doing anything worse than she is, so it's a valid point to bring up.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. He's addressing an inconsistency in the relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
