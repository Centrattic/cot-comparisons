He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is: the author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which he's not too bothered about. The ex lives a few hours away, and they talk about home stuff and mutual friends. Then there's a coworker, A, who's nice and they've been friends since he started working there. The author used to think A was cute but never made a move. They only have her number for work reasons and haven't seen her outside work. \n\nThe girlfriend shows up during a break, sees the author chatting with A over lunch, gets mad and is upset all day. The author confronts her by pointing out the hypocrisy since she's allowed to be friends with her ex, whom he's okay with, but he can't be friends with A, even though he never asked her out. He's considering bringing it up again and wants to know if he's wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides.\n\nThe author's actions: He's having a normal work lunch with a coworker. The coworker is someone he's known for a while, but there's no indication of any romantic interest beyond initial attraction that he didn't act on. He communicates this to his girlfriend when confronting her.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction: She gets upset upon seeing them together, even though the author isn't doing anything inappropriate. Her ex is someone she talks to occasionally, but the author isn't upset about that. The key here is the double standard. The author is highlighting that his girlfriend is allowed to have a past relationship, while he's being criticized for a platonic friendship with a coworker. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If there's no romantic involvement with the coworker, and the author is just maintaining a work-related friendship, then he's not doing anything wrong. The girlfriend's jealousy is the issue here. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in her behavior, which is a valid concern. However, the way he approaches it could affect their relationship dynamics. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for being in that situation or confronting her about the double standard.\n\nGiven that the author isn't engaging in anything inappropriate and is addressing the unfairness, the answer would likely be B (No). The girlfriend's behavior is the problem, not the author's. The author is in the right for pointing out the hypocrisy and seeking equality in their relationship.\n"
