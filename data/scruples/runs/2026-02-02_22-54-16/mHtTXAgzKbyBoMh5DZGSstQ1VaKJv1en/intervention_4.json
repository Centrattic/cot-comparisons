He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is in a relationship where his girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally. The author himself has a female coworker, A, whom he's friends with but hasn't dated. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting during lunch.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's reaction and the author's actions. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, and she talks to him about stuff like mutual friends and hometown things. The author is pointing out the double standard: he's allowed to be friends with a coworker, but his girlfriend is allowed to keep in contact with an ex. The author didn't do anything wrong by having a work-related friendship, and the girlfriend's jealousy seems misplaced. The author is considering pointing out the inconsistency in her behavior.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't in the wrong. He hasn't acted on any feelings towards A, just maintains a professional relationship. The girlfriend's issue is with her ex, who is not just a friend but a former partner, which might be a different context. However, the author's response was to highlight the double standard, which is a reasonable approach. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
