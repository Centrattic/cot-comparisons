He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy whose girlfriend is upset he's talking to a coworker, even though she talks to her ex. He's thinking of confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, about mutual friends and home stuff. The author has a coworker friend, A, who he's never dated, only met at work. The girlfriend saw them chatting and got mad. The author feels it's unfair because his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't be friends with a coworker he's never dated.\n\nSo, the main issue is the perceived double standard. The author is questioning why his girlfriend's friendship with her ex is acceptable, but his friendship with a coworker is not. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nI need to assess if the author did something wrong. The author didn't make any moves on A, only work-related contact. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to date, but they don't talk often. The problem arises when the girlfriend reacts negatively to the author's friendship with A, but not her own with the ex.\n\nIs it fair for the girlfriend to be upset? That's subjective. Some might say friends can be friends with others, even exes, as long as it's respectful. Others might feel that the girlfriend's ex is more of a \"former romantic partner\" and thus different from a platonic work friend. However, the author is pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nThe author's action was to confront the girlfriend about this. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the author isn't engaging in anything inappropriate (no dates, no flirting), then maybe he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction could be based on insecurity or jealousy, not necessarily the author's actions.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. Confronting her again might escalate things. However, the initial confrontation was about pointing out a double standard, which he felt was unfair.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining a work relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might be the issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
