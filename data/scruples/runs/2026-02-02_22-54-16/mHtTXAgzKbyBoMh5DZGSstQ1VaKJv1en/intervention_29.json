He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset about a conversation with a female coworker, while the author is concerned about the girlfriend's ongoing contact with her ex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's ex is mentioned as someone she talks to regularly. The author doesn't mind this, as they live a few hours apart and talk about mutual friends and home. But when the author's coworker, A, is seen chatting during lunch, the girlfriend gets upset. The author then points out the inconsistency.\n\nThe key here is about fairness in relationships. The author is highlighting a double standard: his girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with an ex, but he can't have a platonic friendship with a female coworker. The author is trying to address this perceived inequality. \n\nNow, considering the actions of both parties: the author hasn't done anything inappropriate with coworker A\u2014just work-related communication. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or insecurity. The author's response is to bring up the inconsistency, which seems reasonable given the situation.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, bringing up the issue isn't inherently wrong. However, the approach and timing could matter. If the author is now planning to confront her again, it's important that the conversation is respectful and constructive. But based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the double standard. The main issue is the girlfriend's reaction and her contact with her ex versus the author's situation with coworker A.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's addressing a valid concern about fairness in the relationship.\n"
