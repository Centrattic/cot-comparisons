He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on their girlfriend regarding her ex and his coworker friend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend talks to her ex regularly, which the author doesn't mind. The ex lives a few hours away, and their conversations are about mutual friends and things back home. So, the author is okay with that.\n\nThen there's coworker A. The author and A are friends from work, with no romantic interest. The author has her number only for work. The girlfriend sees them chatting during lunch and gets upset. The author is frustrated because the girlfriend is mad at him for being friends with A, while she's allowed to talk to her ex. He's considering confronting her about the inconsistency.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. From the information given, the author isn't doing anything inappropriate. He's maintaining a professional friendship with a coworker, and the girlfriend's ex is a long-distance contact. The issue here is about perceived double standards. The author isn't in the wrong for having a platonic relationship that's similar in nature to what his girlfriend has with her ex. The key point is that the author isn't engaging in anything that resembles the girlfriend's ex's relationship with her. The girlfriend's reaction seems unfair, so the author isn't at fault. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
