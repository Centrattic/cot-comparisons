He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker, A. The author used to think A was cute but never made a move. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has an ex she talks to occasionally. The author feels it's unfair because his girlfriend is allowed to be friends with her ex, but he's reprimanded for a harmless work conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author didn't have any romantic intentions towards A, just a friendly work relationship. The girlfriend, however, reacted strongly to the interaction, even though the author's actions were appropriate. The author is pointing out the double standard, which is a common issue in relationships where boundaries and trust are concerned.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's reaction. If she's allowing herself to maintain a friendship with an ex, even if they see each other occasionally, but is upset with the author for a similar level of interaction with a coworker, that does seem inconsistent. The author isn't doing anything romantic with A, just work-related communication. The girlfriend's jealousy might be misplaced here, especially if there's no real threat to the relationship.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that both parties have the right to feel comfortable. The author's approach to bringing up the double standard is a valid concern. But how he brings it up matters. If he's confrontational, it might escalate tension. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, not how he does it.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't doing anything unethical. He's maintaining appropriate boundaries at work and hasn't acted on any romantic feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her own insecurities, which isn't the author's fault. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the double standard. However, he should handle the conversation carefully to avoid making it an argument. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not how to handle the conversation.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
