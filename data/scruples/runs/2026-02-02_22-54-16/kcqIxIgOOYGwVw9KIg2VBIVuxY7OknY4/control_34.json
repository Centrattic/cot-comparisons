He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. So the boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, and he was raised in that environment too. The boyfriend cooks Italian food, speaks some Italian, and says he's Italian.\n\nThe author is upset because he's not actually ethnically Italian. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being angry about that. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Many people identify with a culture even if they don't have biological ties. Like, if someone is adopted into a family and grows up in that culture, they might still identify with it. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, so maybe he feels Italian. It's about personal identity and upbringing, not just blood.\n\nBut the author is bothered by the idea of cultural appropriation. But is it appropriation if he was raised in that culture? Cultural appropriation usually refers to taking elements from a culture that you don't belong to, which can be offensive. However, if he was immersed in the culture from a young age, it might not be appropriation but rather cultural affiliation. \n\nThe boyfriend says he wasn't born Italian but raised Italian. So he's claiming a cultural identity based on upbringing. The author's issue is about blood. But cultural identity is often about how you were raised and the community you're part of. So the boyfriend might not be wrong in identifying as Italian if that's his upbringing. \n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that cultural identity should be based on ancestry. But in many cases, people without blood ties can still identify with a culture. For example, someone adopted into an Italian family can consider themselves Italian. \n\nSo the question is whether the boyfriend's claim is valid. If he was raised in that culture, then it's his right to identify as Italian. The author is upset because he's not \"blood Italian,\" but that's a narrow view of what makes someone part of a culture. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting his cultural identity based on upbringing rather than blood. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). Wait, no, the options are A for yes (she's wrong) and B for no. If the author is not in the wrong, then answer B. But I need to make sure.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance here. The boyfriend's mother was adopted, so maybe he's not technically ethnically Italian. But if the family raised him as Italian, he can identify that way. The author's issue is about authenticity. However, cultural identity is personal. The author is upset because he's not of Italian descent. But the boyfriend's claim is based on upbringing and environment, not blood. \n\nSo the author is in the wrong for being angry about something that's more about personal identity. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong). Wait, the options are A (yes, author is wrong) and B (no). If the author is not in the wrong, answer B. If she is in the wrong, answer A.\n\nHmm. The key point is whether the author is wrong for being angry about the boyfriend's cultural claim. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the culture through upbringing, then the author's anger is misplaced, making her in the wrong. So answer A. But if cultural identity can be based on upbringing, then the author is in the wrong for being angry. So the answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong. Wait, no, the options are A and B. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the author is not in the wrong (i.e., it's okay for her to be angry), then B. If she is in the wrong (she shouldn't be angry), then A. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. So if the boyfriend's claim is valid, then the author is in the wrong (A). If his claim is not valid, then the author is not (B). \n\nThe boyfriend's situation is that he was raised in an Italian household, even though he has no Italian blood. So by many cultural definitions, he's considered Italian. The author is upset because of blood. But in many cases, cultural identity isn't solely based on genetics. Therefore, the author's anger is misplaced, so she's in the wrong (A). Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
