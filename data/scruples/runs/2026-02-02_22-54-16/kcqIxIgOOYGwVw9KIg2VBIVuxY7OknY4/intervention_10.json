He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but the boyfriend himself isn't of Italian descent. He cooks Italian food, speaks some Italian, and identifies as Italian culturally. The author feels he's appropriating the culture because he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity versus ethnic heritage. Cultural identity can be formed through upbringing, environment, and personal identification, even if there's no direct ethnic link. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, so he's assimilated into that culture. But the author is upset because she thinks being Italian should require blood relation.\n\nI should think about how cultures are often passed down through families. If someone is raised within a culture, they can genuinely feel part of it, even without biological ties. However, cultural appropriation can be an issue when someone benefits from or uses aspects of a culture without acknowledging its struggles or when it's done insensitively. But in this case, the boyfriend's family was raising him in the Italian culture, so it's more about cultural transmission through adoption.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's upbringing in an Italian environment and his identification with that culture. The author's concern is about authenticity in claiming ethnic identity. But culturally, many people identify with a culture they were raised in, regardless of blood. For example, adoptees or people raised in multicultural homes can identify with a culture even if they're not ethnically part of it.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of cultural appropriation. If someone is using elements of a culture without facing the same social challenges as those from that culture, it can be seen as appropriation. But the boyfriend's case seems more like cultural assimilation through upbringing rather than superficial adoption. He was immersed in the culture from a young age.\n\nThe author might feel that claiming Italian identity without being ethnically Italian is invalid, but culturally, self-identification is a big part of how people perceive themselves. The boyfriend might genuinely see himself as Italian because that's how he was raised. The issue here is about the author's discomfort with his self-identification versus societal norms around cultural identity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend's claim is based on his upbringing and cultural environment, then his identification makes sense. However, if the author feels that cultural identity should require ethnic heritage, that's a valid perspective too. But since cultural identity is complex and varies, the author's reaction isn't necessarily wrong. However, if the boyfriend is being deceptive or insincere, that's different. But the scenario suggests he's open about his background, just claiming cultural identity based on upbringing.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, but the boyfriend's identification as Italian based on his upbringing could be seen as acceptable. The answer would be B (No).\n"
