He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he's not of Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but the author feels he's appropriating the culture without being Italian by blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the nuances here. Cultural identity can be complex. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. But the author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood. So, the main conflict is about whether cultural upbringing and practices are enough to claim that identity.\n\nI remember that in many cases, people can identify with a culture even if they don't have direct ancestry. For example, someone raised in a different country might adopt the cultural practices of that country. But there's a difference between identifying with a culture and appropriating it. Appropriation usually involves a lack of respect or understanding, but the boyfriend here seems to have a deep connection through his upbringing.\n\nThe author's issue is more about the lack of blood relation. But does blood relation define cultural identity? That's debatable. Some might argue that cultural identity is about how one is raised and the practices one follows, not just genetics. On the other hand, others might feel that claiming a heritage without ancestry is appropriation, especially if it's done for certain benefits or to fit in.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is that he was raised Italian. If he genuinely experienced the culture as part of his upbringing, then he might feel that he has a legitimate connection. However, the author feels it's inauthentic because of the lack of blood. This is where personal values and perspectives come into play. The author might value ancestral heritage more, while the boyfriend values cultural upbringing.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, the author has a right to feel that the boyfriend is misrepresenting himself, especially if the boyfriend is quick to claim the identity in social settings. But the boyfriend isn't acting in a stereotypical way, which complicates things. The key here is whether the boyfriend is being honest about his background. If he's transparent about his mother's adoption and upbringing, maybe the author's issue is more about the claim itself rather than the boyfriend's authenticity.\n\nCultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. If the boyfriend is benefiting from the culture without acknowledging the lack of ancestry, that could be seen as appropriation. But if he's immersed in the culture through his adoptive family's efforts and respects it, it's more about cultural identification. The line is blurry here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable. However, the boyfriend might believe he has a valid connection through upbringing. It's a matter of perspective and how each person defines cultural identity. The author's feelings are valid, but whether the boyfriend is wrong depends on how he presents his identity. If he's honest about his background but still chooses to identify with the culture, that's a personal choice. But if he's misleading others about his ancestry, that could be problematic.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author's perspective is valid in feeling that the boyfriend is appropriating the culture without blood relation, even if the boyfriend sees it as cultural upbringing.\n"
