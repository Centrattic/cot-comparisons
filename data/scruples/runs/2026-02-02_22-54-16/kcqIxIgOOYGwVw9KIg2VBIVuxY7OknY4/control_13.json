He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian without having Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. He was also raised in that environment, learned Italian, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. He doesn't act stereotypically but takes pride in the culture. The author is upset because he's claiming Italian identity without actual blood relation.\n\nSo, cultural identity can be complex. People often identify with a culture they were raised in, even if they don't have biological ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still feel connected to it. But others might see that as appropriation if there's no ancestral link. \n\nThe boyfriend argues that being raised Italian makes him Italian culturally. The author feels it's not enough. The key here is whether cultural identity can be claimed without blood. There's a difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation. If he's immersed in the culture from childhood and integrates it into his life authentically, some might see that as valid. However, if it's more about performing aspects for social reasons, others might see it as inauthentic.\n\nEthnically, Italian identity is often tied to ancestry, but culturally it's about upbringing. The boyfriend might feel his identity is legitimate because he was raised that way. The author's issue is that he's not ethnically Italian. It's possible both perspectives have merit. The boyfriend might be expressing his cultural upbringing, while the author values biological heritage. \n\nThere's no right or wrong here in an absolute sense. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. Since people can have different views on cultural identity, the author isn't necessarily wrong for her feelings. The boyfriend isn't wrong for identifying with his upbringing either. The situation is about differing values. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
