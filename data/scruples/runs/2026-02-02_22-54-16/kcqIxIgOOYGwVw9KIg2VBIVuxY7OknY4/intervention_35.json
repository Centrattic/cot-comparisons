He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a boyfriend who claims to be Italian, even though he doesn't have Italian blood. His mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment too. The author is upset because he's identifying as Italian without being of Italian descent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture even if they don't have the ethnic background. For example, someone raised in a specific cultural environment might feel that culture is part of their identity. In this case, the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and so on. So maybe he feels connected to Italian culture. But the author thinks he's appropriating the culture since he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nCultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It's about taking elements of a culture without understanding or respecting its significance. However, in this case, the boyfriend has a deep connection through his upbringing. So maybe it's not appropriation but rather cultural affiliation through upbringing. The author is upset because he's claiming to be of Italian descent when he's not, which could be seen as misrepresentation.\n\nBut then again, ethnicity and cultural identity can be complex. Some people might say that being raised in a culture makes you part of it, regardless of blood. Others might argue that claiming an ethnic identity without the heritage is wrong. The author's issue is that he's not actually Italian by descent, just by upbringing. So the question is, is it wrong for someone to identify with a culture they were raised in even if their bloodline isn't connected?\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response is that he was raised Italian. That's a common argument when people say they were raised in a certain way. The author is conflicted because she appreciates the Italian food and his pride in the culture but feels it's inauthentic. So it's a matter of perspective. Is it the author's place to question his identity? Or is it his right to self-identify?\n\nIn some cases, people might have different experiences. If the boyfriend was adopted into an Italian family and grew up that way, he might have a valid connection. But since his mother was adopted, maybe he's a second generation in that sense. The author might feel that heritage is important, but others might see it as the culture that shapes one's identity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the Italian culture through upbringing, then maybe the author is overreacting. But if the author values ethnic heritage and feels that the boyfriend is being inauthentic, then she's justified. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could depend on how one views cultural identity versus ethnic descent.\n"
