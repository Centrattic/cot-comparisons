He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without actually having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted into an Italian family, so he grew up in an Italian household but doesn't have Italian ancestry. The author feels he's appropriating the culture and is upset when he says he's Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with the culture they were raised in, even if it's not their ethnic background. Like, if someone grows up speaking another language, eating the food, celebrating the holidays, they might feel a strong connection. But others might argue that ethnicity is based on bloodline.\n\nThen, appropriation vs appreciation. The author is concerned about cultural appropriation. But if the boyfriend is raised in the culture, is it appropriation? Maybe not. Some cultures are passed down through adoption or upbringing, not just genetics. For example, someone raised in a different culture could feel a valid connection.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he was raised Italian. So he identifies based on his upbringing. The author disagrees, thinking that just being raised in a culture doesn't make you part of it. But cultural identity can be complex. Some people value both heritage and cultural practice. Others might prioritize biological ties.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking Italian food, speaking the language\u2014those are cultural practices. So if someone practices a culture, does that make them part of it? It's a gray area. The author's frustration is understandable if they feel it's inauthentic.\n\nBut is the author wrong to feel that way? The question is whether the author is at fault. The boyfriend isn't pretending to be stereotypical; he's genuinely part of that cultural environment. However, the author might see cultural identity as something tied to ancestry. So, the author's feelings are valid, but does that make them wrong? Probably not. It's a matter of perspective.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often considers intent. The boyfriend isn't maliciously appropriating; he genuinely identifies with the culture he was raised in. The author is upset, but not for a reason that's universally wrong. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid concern about cultural authenticity, even if others might see the boyfriend's identity as legitimate.\n"
