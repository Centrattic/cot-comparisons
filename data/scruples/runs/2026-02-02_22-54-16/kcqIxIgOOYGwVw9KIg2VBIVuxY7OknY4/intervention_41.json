He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the boyfriend claiming to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The author is upset about this cultural appropriation.\n\nFirst, let's break down the details. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She learned Italian and even lived in Italy. The boyfriend was raised in a similar way by his mom, with Italian meals, language, and maybe the neighborhood and school curriculum. The boyfriend's father isn't Italian. The author is upset because the boyfriend is presenting himself as Italian when he doesn't have any Italian blood. The boyfriend justifies it by saying he was raised Italian.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me think about cultural identity. Some people might say that cultural identity isn't just about blood. If someone is raised in a culture, they can identify with it even without direct ancestry. For example, adopted children often take on their adoptive family's culture. So maybe the boyfriend is culturally Italian, even if not ethnically. However, others might argue that claiming heritage without any bloodline could be appropriation, especially if it's used to gain some sort of advantage or if it's insincere.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions include cooking Italian food, speaking Italian, and being part of Italian communities. He doesn't act stereotypically, which might reduce the offensiveness in some eyes. But the author feels that it's not enough just to cook or speak the language to be considered Italian. The key point here is the definition of Italian identity. If the boyfriend identifies as Italian because of his upbringing and environment, some might support that. However, if the author feels it's a misrepresentation because of the lack of blood, that's a valid concern.\n\nCultural appropriation vs. cultural appreciation is a common debate here. If the boyfriend is respecting and integrating the culture meaningfully, it could be seen as appreciation. But if he's using it to claim an identity he doesn't truly belong to, that's appropriation. The line is blurry. Also, in many cases, people who are raised in a culture by non-biological parents can still consider themselves part of that culture. \n\nThe author's frustration might stem from authenticity. They might value ethnic heritage as a key component of cultural identity. On the other hand, the boyfriend's perspective is that culture isn't solely determined by blood. There's also the aspect of the mother's experience\u2014being adopted into an Italian family and raised that way. If she can identify as Italian, perhaps her child can too, especially if he was raised similarly.\n\nBut the author's issue is that the boyfriend is claiming to be Italian without any blood. So the question is whether cultural upbringing alone is enough to claim that identity. Different people have different views on this. Some cultures are more fluid in how they define identity. In some cases, national identity can be self-identified. However, others might require a certain lineage.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling that way. It's a personal boundary issue. The boyfriend might not be in the wrong either for identifying with his upbringing. But the author's feelings are valid, so the boyfriend's response of brushing it off (\"I'm not by blood but raised Italian\") might not be addressing the author's concern properly. The boyfriend might need to understand that the author values bloodline in cultural identity, even if he doesn't. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. It's a matter of differing perspectives on cultural identity. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
