He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is her boyfriend claims to be Italian, but she thinks he's faking it. His mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but he himself doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend says he's raised Italian, but she's upset about cultural appropriation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the arguments from both sides. The author's reasoning is that just because he was raised in an Italian household and can cook and speak Italian doesn't make him ethnically Italian. She feels he's appropriating the culture. On the other hand, the boyfriend's side is that his mother was immersed in Italian culture, and he grew up in that environment, so he identifies as Italian culturally.\n\nCultural identity can be complex. Some people might argue that cultural upbringing and identification are valid, regardless of ethnicity. If he was raised in that culture and identifies with it, maybe he's not wrong to say he's Italian in a cultural sense. But the author is upset about the lack of actual heritage, thinking it's appropriation. \n\nAppropriation versus appreciation is a big topic. If he's genuinely part of the culture through upbringing, it's more appreciation. But if he's just taking elements without any real connection, it's appropriation. Here, his mother was deeply part of the Italian culture, so maybe he's just continuing that legacy. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to be upset. If the boyfriend's claim is based on cultural upbringing and not ethnic background, is that incorrect? It depends on how society views cultural identity. Some cultures allow for cultural identification beyond bloodlines. For example, in some countries, cultural ties can be strong even without ethnic background. \n\nHowever, the author's issue is about authenticity. She might feel that claiming to be Italian without blood ties is misleading. But if the boyfriend is honest about his background and is part of the culture, maybe it's not wrong. The boyfriend says he's raised Italian, which is a valid claim. \n\nSo the author's anger might be misplaced if the boyfriend is culturally Italian. However, if he's using the term to mean ethnicity, then it's a problem. The key is the boyfriend's intent and how he presents himself. If he's clear he's culturally Italian but not ethnically, then the author's issue is about semantics. \n\nIn summary, if the boyfriend's identification is based on upbringing and not ethnic heritage, the author might be overreacting. But if he's presenting himself as ethnically Italian, then the author has a point. The answer would depend on the boyfriend's intent and how he defines his identity. Since the boyfriend clarifies he's not by blood but raised Italian, the author might be in the wrong for being angry over cultural identification.\n"
