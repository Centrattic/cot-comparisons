He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the post) is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he's not ethnically Italian.\n\nSo the boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian. He himself was raised in an Italian household, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, etc., but doesn't have Italian blood. The author feels that he's appropriating the culture because he's not ethnically Italian. The boyfriend argues he was raised Italian, so it's okay.\n\nHmm. Cultural identity can be tricky. On one hand, culture isn't just about bloodline. If someone is immersed in a culture from a young age, they might feel a strong connection to it. For example, if someone is raised in a specific culture, they might adopt its traditions, language, and practices. That could be seen as being part of that culture, even if they're not ethnically from there. Like, if someone is adopted into a Japanese family and grows up with Japanese customs, they might identify as Japanese culturally.\n\nBut the author is upset because the boyfriend is claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have any blood relation. The author might feel that cultural heritage is about ancestry, not just upbringing. There's a line between cultural appreciation and appropriation here. The boyfriend is using the culture (cooking, language) but maybe the author feels it's not genuine without the ethnic background.\n\nHowever, cultural identity can be complex. Some people identify culturally with a group they're not ethnically part of. It's possible the boyfriend has a valid connection through upbringing. The author's anger might stem from feeling that the boyfriend is inauthentic or misrepresenting himself. But then again, if the boyfriend was raised in that culture, maybe he does have a legitimate connection.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised Italian. So maybe the cultural connection is valid through her, even if it's not through blood. The boyfriend's identity as Italian could be seen as legitimate if it's through his upbringing and his mother's influence.\n\nBut the author's perspective is that blood matters. That might be a point of contention. It's possible that the author is right to feel that the boyfriend is appropriating the culture if he's not ethnically connected. However, others might argue that cultural identity isn't solely about biology.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if the boyfriend is genuinely immersed in the culture and identifies with it, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the boyfriend is using it as a primary identity without any ethnic ties, the author might have a valid point. However, cultural identity can be multifaceted. It's possible that both perspectives have merit. The key is whether the boyfriend's identification is respectful and based on actual experience, which he seems to have through upbringing. Therefore, the author might be in the right to be upset, but the boyfriend's claim isn't entirely baseless. It's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. But according to the question, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Since the boyfriend's cultural connection is through upbringing and environment, not just blood, the author's anger might be unwarranted. So the answer could be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), because the boyfriend's claim might be considered appropriation if it's without ethnic ties. But I'm a bit torn because cultural identity is more than just blood.\n"
