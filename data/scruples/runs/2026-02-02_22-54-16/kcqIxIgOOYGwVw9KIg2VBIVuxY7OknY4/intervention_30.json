He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family, so he was raised in an Italian household but doesn't have any Italian blood. The author feels that since he doesn't have Italian ancestry, he shouldn't claim to be Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the concept of cultural identity. Sometimes people identify with a culture they were raised in, even if they don't have biological ties. For example, if someone grows up in a household where they speak the language, celebrate the traditions, and are immersed in the culture, they might feel a strong connection. But does that make them part of that culture? Some people might argue that cultural identity can be formed through upbringing and environment, not just blood.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset because they feel the boyfriend is appropriating the culture. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It usually involves someone from a dominant culture adopting elements from a marginalized culture without permission or understanding. However, in this case, the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household. The line between appreciation and appropriation might be blurry here. If he was genuinely immersed in the culture from a young age, is it appreciation? Or is it appropriation if there's no ancestral connection?\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he was raised Italian. If that's his lived experience, he might feel that he has a legitimate claim to the culture. But the author's issue is with the lack of biological ties. The question is, does biological heritage matter in cultural identity? This can vary depending on cultural norms. In some cultures, ethnicity is the main factor, while others prioritize cultural upbringing.\n\nAnother angle is the significance of the claim. If the boyfriend is using his Italian identity in a way that's important to him and others don't question it, maybe the author's objection is more about personal values. The author might value authenticity based on heritage, while the boyfriend values cultural upbringing. There's no right or wrong here, just differing perspectives.\n\nI should also consider the emotional aspect. The author is upset because they perceive the boyfriend as faking it. If the boyfriend is proud of his upbringing and it's a genuine part of his identity, even without blood ties, the author's anger might stem from feeling that the identity is insincere. However, if the boyfriend's identity is rooted in his experiences and environment, it's not necessarily insincere.\n\nIn summary, whether the author is wrong depends on how one views cultural identity. If cultural identity can be formed through upbringing regardless of blood, then the author might be in the wrong for being upset. But if the author values biological heritage, their reaction is understandable. The answer hinges on societal norms and personal beliefs about what constitutes cultural identity.\n"
