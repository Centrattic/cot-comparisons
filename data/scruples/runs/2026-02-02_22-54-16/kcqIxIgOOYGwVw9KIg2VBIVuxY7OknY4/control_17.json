He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family, so she was raised Italian, and he grew up in that environment. The author is upset because he identifies as Italian without any blood relation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. People often identify with a culture they were raised in, even without biological ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still consider themselves part of that culture. The boyfriend's case is similar; his mother's adoption into an Italian family shaped his upbringing, so he might genuinely feel a connection to Italian culture.\n\nBut the author is concerned about cultural appropriation. However, cultural appropriation usually involves adopting elements of a culture in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive of that culture's significance. In this case, the boyfriend's engagement with Italian culture seems to be part of his upbringing. He's cooking Italian food, speaking the language, and the neighborhood influenced him. It's more about cultural heritage through environment rather than appropriation.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he was raised Italian, not by blood. That's a common way people form their identities. For instance, someone can identify with a religion or cultural practices without being born into it. So, if he was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, it's reasonable for him to identify as such.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels he's faking it. But if the adoption was legitimate and the environment was authentic, then his identity might be valid. The distinction here is between ethnicity (biological) and cultural identity. Ethnicity is about ancestry, but cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions don't seem to be a shallow adoption. He's involved deeply in Italian culture through food, language, and community. That suggests a genuine connection rather than superficial appropriation.\n\nSo, the author might be conflating ethnic background with cultural identity. The boyfriend's identification isn't wrong if it's based on his upbringing and personal experience. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but the boyfriend isn't wrong either. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's reacting to his cultural identity, which he has valid reasons for, her being angry might not be justified. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced.\n"
