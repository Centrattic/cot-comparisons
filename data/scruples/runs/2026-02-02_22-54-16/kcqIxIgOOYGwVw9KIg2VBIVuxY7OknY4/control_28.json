He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but he himself isn't ethnically Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and is part of an Italian community. He identifies as Italian because of his upbringing. But the author feels that without any blood relation, he's appropriating the culture.\n\nCultural identity can be complex. Some people identify with a culture they were raised in even without ethnic ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might grow up identifying with that culture. However, others might argue that claiming ethnic heritage without biological ties can be seen as appropriation, especially if it's used to access community or benefits.\n\nThe key here is the boyfriend's intention. If he's genuinely immersed in the culture and identifies with it, many would see that as valid. But the author's discomfort is about authenticity. They feel he's misrepresenting himself by not having Italian blood. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response about being raised Italian shows he's aware of the distinction. The author might feel disrespected because they value ethnic authenticity. But others might say cultural identity isn't solely about blood\u2014it's about lived experience and connection.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the boyfriend has a strong connection to Italian culture through upbringing, many would say he's not wrong to identify that way. The author's anger might stem from personal values, but it's not necessarily the boyfriend's fault. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. Wait, the options are AITA (Am I the Asshole). The user wants to know if the author is wrong. If the boyfriend's identity is valid, then the author isn't wrong to be upset, but maybe the boyfriend isn't wrong either. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the boyfriend is using cultural identity as raised, and the author is upset about appropriation, it's a matter of perspective. But the boyfriend isn't lying about his heritage since he was raised in that culture. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because cultural appropriation is a real issue. But others might say cultural identity isn't just about blood. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the boyfriend is claiming a culture he isn't ethnically part of, which could be seen as appropriation. Alternatively, if the boyfriend genuinely identifies with the culture, then he's not wrong. But the author's feelings are valid. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B. Wait, but maybe the author is overreacting. The boyfriend's mother's adoption doesn't transfer to him ethnically. But he was raised Italian, so he has a cultural connection. It's a gray area. The answer might be B because the boyfriend's identification is based on upbringing, and the author's anger is valid. But I'm not sure. Let me check similar cases. In some cases, people raised in a culture are allowed to identify with it. So the author's issue is with the absence of blood, but that's not the only factor. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but others might have different opinions. Alternatively, the answer could be A if the boyfriend's identification is acceptable. I think the correct answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about cultural appropriation when there's no ethnic connection, even if the boyfriend has a cultural upbringing. But I'm not entirely certain. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry, but the author's perspective is valid here.\n"
