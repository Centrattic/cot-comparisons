He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming Italian heritage even though he doesn't have any blood relation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and lived in an Italian neighborhood. The boyfriend was raised in that environment too, learned Italian in school, and his mom cooks Italian food. He identifies as Italian, but there's no genetic connection.\n\nThe author is upset because he's claiming to be Italian without blood, which she sees as cultural appropriation. He argues that being raised Italian is enough. The question is about whether she's at fault for feeling this way.\n\nCultural identity is complex. Some people might argue that cultural identity isn't just about blood but about upbringing and environment. If someone grows up immersed in a culture, they might feel a legitimate connection. However, others might see it as appropriation if there's no ancestral link, especially if it's used to claim belonging without the heritage.\n\nThe boyfriend's case seems like he was immersed in the culture through his mother, but technically, there's no Italian ancestry. The author's issue is with the authenticity of his claim. The boyfriend's response that he's \"raised Italian\" is a common argument for cultural identity. However, the author feels it's inauthentic because he doesn't have the bloodline.\n\nI should consider cultural sensitivity. If the boyfriend respects the culture, uses the language, participates in traditions, and doesn't mock or stereotype, maybe his identification is valid. But the author's discomfort is about authenticity and appropriation. \n\nIn some cases, people can adopt aspects of a culture they're connected to through family, even without blood. But there's a line between appreciation and appropriation. If he's using the culture to fit in or gain a false identity, that's different. However, if he's genuinely part of the community through upbringing, maybe it's okay.\n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that the boyfriend is being inauthentic or pretending to have an identity he doesn't, which could be a valid concern. But others might say that cultural identity isn't solely about genetics. It's a gray area.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's being judgmental about a valid cultural identity claim, maybe she is. But if the boyfriend is misrepresenting his heritage for personal gain or without respecting its roots, she's justified. The key is whether the boyfriend's actions are respectful and based on genuine upbringing. The boyfriend's own mother was raised in an Italian household, so his connection is through her. That could be seen as legitimate. \n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author has a right to be upset if she feels the boyfriend is falsely claiming a culture. But I'm a bit conflicted because cultural identity can be fluid. However, the lack of any blood relation and the claim might be seen as appropriation if not done respectfully. Since the boyfriend is using the culture but not of that heritage, the author's feelings are valid. So, B.\n"
