He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and even spent time in Italy. The boyfriend grew up in a similar environment, learning Italian, cooking Italian food, and living in an Italian neighborhood. He doesn't act stereotypically, but he says he's Italian.\n\nThe author is upset because they believe you need actual Italian blood to claim the culture. The boyfriend argues that being raised Italian makes him Italian. The author thinks cultural appropriation is happening here.\n\nNow, considering cultural identity. Many people identify with a culture even if they don't have blood ties. For example, someone adopted into a family might take on the cultural practices of their adoptive family. The boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture through his upbringing, language, and traditions. So, his identification as Italian could be legitimate from a cultural standpoint, even without biological ties.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that cultural appropriation is occurring. Cultural appropriation often involves taking elements of a culture without understanding or respecting their significance, especially when it's done by a dominant group. But in this case, the boyfriend was raised in that culture, so it's more about cultural identity rather than appropriation. Cultural identity can be based on upbringing and environment, not just genetics.\n\nThe author's reaction is about feeling that the boyfriend is falsely claiming an identity. But cultural identity is often self-identified. If the boyfriend grew up within that culture, it's reasonable for him to consider himself Italian. The author's anger might stem from a belief that ethnic identity should be based on ancestry, which is a common viewpoint but not universally accepted.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how the boyfriend responds. He says he wasn't born Italian but was raised that way. The author might feel that this is insufficient, but others might see it as a valid form of cultural identity.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how one views cultural identity. If culture is seen as something that can be adopted through upbringing, then the boyfriend's claim is valid. If the author believes it must be tied to blood, they might feel justified. However, in many contexts, cultural identity is more fluid and can be self-determined based on experience and upbringing.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's perspective is understandable, but the boyfriend's claim to Italian identity is also valid. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way, but it's a matter of differing views on cultural identity. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether claiming cultural identity without biological ties is acceptable. If cultural identity is allowed to be self-assigned based on upbringing, then the author is in the wrong for being angry. If not, then the boyfriend is in the wrong. Given that cultural identity is often self-determined, the author's anger is not entirely unjustified but might be based on a misunderstanding of cultural identity dynamics.\n"
