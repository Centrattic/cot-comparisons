He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without being of Italian descent. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family, raised in an Italian household, and the boyfriend was raised in a similarly Italian environment. The author feels he's appropriating the culture since he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. Can someone be considered part of a culture if they were raised in it, even if they don't have ancestral ties? The boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture through his upbringing\u2014language, food, community, etc. The author might feel that cultural identity should be based on heritage. But others might argue that cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing and environment.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he was raised Italian, so he identifies that way. But the author feels it's appropriation because he's not of Italian descent. Is that a fair point? Cultural appropriation is often about power dynamics and disrespect, but here it seems more about personal identity. The boyfriend is part of the Italian community in terms of his upbringing, even if not by blood. \n\nThe author's issue is with the claim of being Italian. If the boyfriend is part of the Italian cultural community, maybe he can identify that way. However, the author might see it as inauthentic without the heritage. But cultural identity can be complex. Some people in adoptive or mixed families do identify with the culture of their upbringing. \n\nI think the boyfriend isn't wrong for identifying with the culture he was raised in. The author's frustration might stem from valuing ethnic heritage over cultural upbringing. But whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspectives on identity. Since the boyfriend was immersed in the culture, others might see his claim as legitimate. The author isn't necessarily wrong to feel uncomfortable, but the boyfriend's identity isn't entirely inauthentic. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's identity is valid because of upbringing, then the author is right to be upset if they value blood ties. But if cultural identity is valid regardless of blood, then the author is in the wrong. I think in this case, the answer is B because the boyfriend's identity is based on his upbringing, so the author isn't right to call him out for not having blood ties. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Wait, the options are A for yes (author wrong) and B for no (author not wrong). If the author is not wrong, then the answer is B.\n"
