He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, so he was raised in an Italian household but doesn't have Italian blood. The author is upset about him identifying as Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Ethnicity can be a tricky topic. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, learned the language, and participates in the culture. So, even without biological ties, some people might identify with the culture they were raised in. But the author feels he's appropriating the culture without being part of it. \n\nI should think about the concept of cultural appropriation versus cultural appreciation. If he's genuinely part of the community through upbringing, maybe it's not appropriation. But the author is bothered by the claim of being Italian when there's no blood relation. It's a matter of sensitivity and personal boundaries in the relationship.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response is that he was raised Italian. So from his perspective, he's part of that culture. However, the author feels he's being deceptive by not clarifying the lack of blood relation. The question is whether the boyfriend's claim is misleading or if cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing.\n\nAnother angle is the importance of bloodline in cultural identity. Some people believe ethnicity is tied to ancestry, while others see it as more about lived experience. The author might value the ancestral connection, which the boyfriend lacks. The boyfriend might feel that his upbringing and environment make him culturally Italian.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for being upset? It's a matter of perspective. The boyfriend is not lying about being raised in an Italian household, but claiming to be Italian might be seen as incorrect if he's emphasizing ethnic identity over cultural upbringing. The author isn't wrong to feel that he's being deceptive if he's presenting himself as ethnically Italian rather than culturally. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because cultural identity can be complex, but the boyfriend's claim might be problematic if he's presenting his cultural upbringing as ethnic heritage. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
