He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family, and he was raised in an Italian household but doesn't have Italian blood. The author feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture based on upbringing, not just blood. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, and participates in the culture. That can be a valid reason to identify as Italian culturally. But the author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood, which is a common but different perspective.\n\nThen there's the aspect of appropriation versus appreciation. Cultural appropriation usually involves taking elements from a culture without understanding or respecting its significance, often by a dominant group. In this case, the boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, so it's more of an appreciation. However, the author might feel that the boyfriend is using Italian identity without the genetic connection.\n\nThe key point is whether cultural identity can be based on upbringing. If the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household and identifies that way, it's a legitimate cultural identity. The author's issue is with the lack of blood relation, but that's not the only factor in cultural identity. The boyfriend might see himself as part of that culture through his environment and upbringing.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid. Some people place importance on ancestry and blood ties when it comes to cultural identity. The boyfriend's claim might not sit well with the author, especially if the boyfriend is emphasizing bloodline elsewhere. It's a clash between different perspectives on cultural identity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend's identification is based on his upbringing and the author is upset because of the lack of blood relation, the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling that way. But it's also important to recognize that cultural identity isn't solely based on blood. The boyfriend might have a legitimate cultural connection through his upbringing, even without genetic ties. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but the boyfriend's identification might still be valid. The answer would be B (No).\n"
