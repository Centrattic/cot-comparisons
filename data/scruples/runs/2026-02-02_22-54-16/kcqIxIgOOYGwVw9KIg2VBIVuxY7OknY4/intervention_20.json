He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a boyfriend who claims to be Italian, but the author thinks he's faking it because his mother was adopted into an Italian family, and he's raised in an Italian environment. The boyfriend's mom was in foster care, adopted by an Italian family, and was raised Italian. The boyfriend himself grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood, learned Italian, cooks Italian food, and so on. But the author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood and feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. Can someone be considered part of a culture without biological ties? Like, if someone is raised in a culture, speaks the language, and participates in the traditions, does that count as being part of that culture? This is a complex issue because cultural identity isn't solely based on ethnicity or blood. For example, someone can grow up in a multicultural environment and adopt aspects of various cultures. But where's the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation?\n\nThe boyfriend argues that he was raised Italian, which is a valid point. His upbringing included Italian language, food, and possibly customs. However, the author is upset that he claims to be Italian without having any Italian heritage. She might feel he's being deceptive or not authentic. But is it fair to expect someone to have blood ties to claim a culture? That could be exclusionary. On the other hand, if someone is adopting another culture without understanding its depth or context, that might be appropriation. The boyfriend seems to have a genuine connection through his upbringing, so maybe the author's issue is more about blood relation than the actual experience.\n\nAnother angle is the definition of \"Italian.\" Nationality can be based on birthplace, citizenship, or heritage. If someone is raised in an Italian household but doesn't have Italian ancestry, does that make them Italian? It's more of an ethnic or cultural identity. In some cases, people adopt another culture as part of their identity, which is different from ethnicity. The boyfriend's mother, for example, was adopted into an Italian family and raised that way. If she identifies as Italian, then her child might also feel a connection. But the author is focusing on bloodline, which the boyfriend doesn't have.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions: he cooks Italian food, speaks the language, and interacts with Italian people. These are positive aspects of cultural engagement. However, the author feels he's being inauthentic. The key here is whether the boyfriend is being honest about his identity. He clarifies that he's not by blood but raised Italian. If he's upfront about it, maybe the author's problem is more about her own expectations of what makes someone Italian. But if he's presenting himself as ethnically Italian without any biological connection, that could be misleading in certain contexts.\n\nCultural appropriation is different from appreciation. If the boyfriend is merely appreciating the culture (learning the language, cooking the food) and not mocking or using stereotypes, then it's more about appreciation. However, if he's claiming an ethnic identity that he doesn't have, which the author perceives as appropriation, that's where the conflict lies. The line between appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. Some argue that if a person is part of the culture through upbringing, it's not appropriation, but if they're adopting elements without the deep connection, it might be.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid if she feels the boyfriend is being inauthentic. But is it his fault? If he's being honest about his background and upbringing, then maybe the author has a misunderstanding about what defines cultural identity. However, if he's using the label \"Italian\" to claim an ethnic identity that he doesn't have, it could be seen as problematic. The boyfriend's defense is that he was raised in that culture, which is a legitimate basis for cultural identity, even without blood ties. So, the author might be in the wrong in expecting only blood ties for cultural identification.\n\nIn summary, the debate here is about the definition of cultural identity. If someone is immersed in a culture from a young age and identifies with it, they can be considered part of that culture, even without genetic ties. The author's issue is more about biological heritage, which isn't the only determinant of cultural identity. Therefore, the boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong for identifying as Italian in the context of his upbringing. The author might need to reconcile her views on cultural identity with the fact that cultural identity can be adopted and lived, not just inherited.\n"
