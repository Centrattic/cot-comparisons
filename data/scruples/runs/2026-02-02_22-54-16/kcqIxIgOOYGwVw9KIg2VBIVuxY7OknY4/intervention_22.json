He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, so he grew up in an Italian household but doesn't have blood ties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Cultural identity can be complex. Some people identify with a culture they weren't born into if they were raised in that environment. The boyfriend was raised with Italian culture\u2014language, food, traditions, etc. So he might see himself as Italian culturally, even without blood relations. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might see ethnicity as tied to ancestry. The author is upset because he isn't of Italian descent. But does ancestry define ethnicity entirely? There's a difference between ethnic identity and cultural upbringing. The boyfriend's case is more about cultural upbringing, so maybe he's entitled to identify as Italian in that sense.\n\nHowever, the author feels that claiming Italian heritage without blood is appropriation. But cultural appreciation can be positive, but appropriation is usually when someone from a dominant culture takes elements from a marginalized culture. In this case, the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, so it's more about cultural inheritance rather than appropriation. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he was raised Italian. The author disagrees because he doesn't have blood ties. It's a matter of perspective. The boyfriend might feel that his cultural upbringing is sufficient, while the author thinks blood matters. \n\nIs the boyfriend being deceptive? He's not lying about his cultural background but is omitting the fact that he has no blood ties. The author might feel that's misleading. But if he was raised in an Italian household, he might genuinely see himself as Italian. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's valid in feeling that cultural identity should include blood ties, but others might see cultural upbringing as valid. The boyfriend's claim might be based on his lived experience. The author's frustration is understandable but not necessarily wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
