He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether it's okay for the boyfriend to claim to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood, but was raised in an Italian household by an adoptive mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in that culture. He grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood and learned Italian from her. So, he's been immersed in the culture his whole life. Does that count as being Italian culturally, even without the blood? Some people argue that culture isn't just about blood\u2014it's about upbringing and environment. So maybe he's considered Italian in a cultural sense.\n\nBut the author is upset because he claims to be Italian, and she feels that's appropriating the culture since he doesn't have Italian ancestry. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. If someone is benefiting from a culture without being part of it, that can be seen as problematic. However, in this case, his mother was raised Italian, so maybe the connection is a bit deeper. But does that make him ethnically Italian? Probably not. Ethnicity is usually tied to ancestry.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he was raised Italian. So he identifies with the culture he was brought up in. But the author is emphasizing blood relation as a key component of being Italian. Different people have different views on what makes someone part of a culture. Some prioritize heritage, others cultural upbringing. The conflict here is between two valid perspectives: one that values cultural immersion over blood, and another that sees ethnicity as tied to ancestry.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for being angry? Well, she's not wrong to feel that her boyfriend is misrepresenting himself if she values ethnic heritage. But then again, he's not pretending to have Italian blood; he's asserting cultural identity from upbringing. It's a matter of perspective. However, the term \"appropriates\" might be a bit strong here. If the culture is part of his upbringing, even through adoption, it's more about cultural belonging than appropriation. But maybe the author feels that without the bloodline, he's not authentically part of the culture. It's a nuanced issue. The answer might depend on societal norms around cultural identity. In many cases, cultural identity is self-identified, but others might require some ancestral connection. So, the author isn't wrong to be upset, but perhaps there's a misunderstanding of what constitutes cultural belonging. So, the answer is B.\n"
