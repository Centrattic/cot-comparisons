He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and lived in an Italian neighborhood. The boyfriend was also raised in such an environment, learned Italian, and cooked Italian food. He's part of the Italian community and takes pride in that culture. But the author feels he's appropriating the culture since he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nSo the main issue is about cultural identity. The boyfriend is claiming Italian heritage through upbringing rather than blood. The author is upset that he's not being honest about the fact that he's not ethnically Italian. But on the other hand, cultural identity isn't just about blood. Many people identify with a culture they grew up in even if their family isn't from that background. For example, someone might be raised in a different culture than their ancestors and still feel connected to it.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he was raised Italian, which is valid. Cultural identity can be passed down through upbringing, traditions, language, etc. So maybe the author is being too strict by requiring ethnic blood to claim the culture. However, the author's frustration comes from feeling that the boyfriend is misrepresenting himself, which might be a form of cultural appropriation if it's done without respect or understanding. But the boyfriend seems to have a deep connection to the culture, speaking the language, cooking the food, and being immersed in the community.\n\nCultural appropriation is often about power dynamics and disrespect, but here it seems the boyfriend is genuinely part of the community through his upbringing. So maybe the author's anger is misplaced. Alternatively, if the boyfriend is being disingenuous or using the identity for superficial reasons, that could be an issue. But according to the description, he's not acting stereotypically or over-the-top; he's just claiming the culture he was raised in.\n\nIn many cases, people can adopt a culture they grow up in, even if their family isn't ethnically from that background. So the boyfriend's claim to Italian identity might be legitimate from a cultural standpoint. The author's issue might be more about the lack of biological connection, but that's not the only way to define cultural identity. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because they have a valid concern about authenticity, but the boyfriend's identity could also be valid. However, the key here is whether the boyfriend is being deceptive. Since he's honest about his upbringing and the fact that he's not of Italian descent, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the boyfriend presents himself as ethnically Italian when he's not, that could be problematic. The line between cultural identity and appropriation is blurry here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend's identity might be legitimate based on his upbringing. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the issue is about cultural authenticity and personal connection, and the author's feelings are valid in questioning the legitimacy of the claim based on bloodline versus upbringing.\n"
