He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with her boyfriend who claims to be Italian even though his heritage isn't actually Italian. His mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, but he himself isn't of Italian descent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural aspect. Identity can be complex. While bloodline is a factor in some cultures, others value upbringing and cultural practices. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian community. He might see himself as culturally Italian, even without the blood.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that claiming Italian identity without any blood relation is appropriation. That's a common debate around cultural identity\u2014whether you need ancestral ties to a culture to participate in it. Some people argue that culture is about practices and traditions, not just ancestry. Others might see it as appropriation if there's no ancestral link.\n\nThe boyfriend isn't acting like a stereotype, which could mean he's genuinely immersed in the culture. But the author's issue is with the claim of being Italian when there's no heritage. The key point is whether cultural participation justifies cultural identity. If the boyfriend identifies as Italian due to his upbringing, some might support that, while others\u2014like the author\u2014see it as problematic.\n\nThe author isn't wrong to feel that way. She's pointing out the lack of blood relation, which is a valid perspective, especially if she values ancestral ties. But is her anger justified? It depends on how the boyfriend's claims affect their relationship. If it's causing friction and he's not respecting her feelings, that's a problem. However, the boyfriend might be expressing his cultural identity, which is also valid.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the definition of cultural identity. If the community accepts him as Italian, maybe he's within his rights. But if the author believes that identity requires ancestry, she's not necessarily wrong to be upset. The right answer here might be that she's not in the wrong (B), because her perspective is valid, even if the boyfriend's claim is based on cultural upbringing.\n"
