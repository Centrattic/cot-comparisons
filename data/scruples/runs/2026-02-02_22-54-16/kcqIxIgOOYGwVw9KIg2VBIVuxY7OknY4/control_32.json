He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without being of Italian descent. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but he himself isn't ethnically Italian. The author feels that he's appropriating the culture by claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have any blood relation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. People can identify with a culture even if they don't have direct ancestry. For example, someone raised in a household with strong cultural traditions might feel that identity is part of who they are. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, learned the language, and immersed himself in the culture through his mother's efforts. So, from his perspective, being Italian could be a valid cultural identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset because they believe ethnic identity is tied to blood. But cultural appropriation versus cultural appreciation is a sensitive topic. If the boyfriend is respectfully engaging with the culture rather than mocking or misrepresenting it, it might be seen as appreciation. However, if the author feels it's insincere or deceptive, that's a valid feeling.\n\nI should also consider if there's any harm in the boyfriend's claim. If he's not pretending to be ethnically Italian but is embracing a culture he was raised in, maybe the issue is more about the author's personal values. The boyfriend might not be appropriating but rather identifying with a culture that shaped his upbringing.\n\nAnother angle: the author's discomfort might stem from authenticity in relationships. If the boyfriend was honest from the start about his background, maybe the author's issue is the dishonesty in claiming a heritage he doesn't have. But the boyfriend's explanation is that he was raised Italian, which complicates things.\n\nCultural identity can be complex. Some people form their identity through upbringing rather than genetics. The boyfriend might genuinely feel Italian because of how he was raised. However, the author's perspective is that blood relation is necessary for cultural identity, which is a different viewpoint but a common one.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing. If yes, the author might be in the wrong for dismissing the boyfriend's cultural identity. If not, the boyfriend's claims are misleading. But given that cultural identity often isn't strictly about blood, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. However, the author's feelings are valid if they perceive deception. It's a nuanced situation.\n"
