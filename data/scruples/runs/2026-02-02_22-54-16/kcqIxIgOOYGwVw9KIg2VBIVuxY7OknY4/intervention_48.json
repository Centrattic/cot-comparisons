He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, leading him to be raised similarly. The author feels that even though he's immersed in Italian culture, he isn't ethnically Italian, so he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture they weren't born into but were raised in. The boyfriend's case is a bit complicated because his mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised Italian, which influenced his upbringing. So he's part of a community that's passed down cultural practices to him. However, the author is upset because he's claiming Italian heritage without blood ties, which the author sees as appropriation.\n\nCultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It can involve adopting elements of another culture in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive of the origin. But in this case, the boyfriend isn't just taking bits and pieces; he was raised in an Italian household, learned the language, and maintains the culture. His connection through his mother's adoption might make it more about cultural inheritance rather than appropriation. However, the author's perspective is that without blood, it's not genuine.\n\nOn the other hand, identity is complex. Many people identify with the culture they were raised in, regardless of ethnicity. The boyfriend might genuinely feel Italian due to his upbringing. The author's issue is with the claim of being Italian when he isn't ethnically, which could be a matter of perspective. Is it about biology versus cultural upbringing?\n\nThe author's feelings are valid. If this issue is causing conflict in their relationship, it's important to address. But whether the author is in the wrong depends on societal views on cultural identity. Some might argue that cultural identity isn't solely about blood, so the boyfriend's claim is legitimate. Others might side with the author that without ethnic ties, it's appropriation.\n\nI need to check if there's a cultural consensus here. In some cases, people who are adopted into different cultures can identify with that culture. However, if the boyfriend is claiming a heritage that's not his to the point of excluding the author's feelings, that's problematic. The key is whether the boyfriend is being respectful or appropriative. The post says he doesn't act stereotypically, so maybe it's more about cultural pride rather than mockery.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's feelings are valid, but whether they're in the wrong depends on how one views cultural identity. The boyfriend's situation is unique because of his mother's background, which might give him a cultural connection. However, the author's discomfort isn't invalid. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer is B (No), because the author isn't wrong for feeling upset about cultural misrepresentation in their relationship.\n"
