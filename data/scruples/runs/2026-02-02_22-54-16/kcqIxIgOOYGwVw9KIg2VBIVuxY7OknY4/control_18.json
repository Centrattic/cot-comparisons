He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong (AITA) for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised as Italian, but he himself isn't of Italian descent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and lives in a predominantly Italian area. He identifies as Italian culturally. The author feels he's appropriating the culture because he doesn't have Italian blood. But is that a valid reason to be upset?\n\nCultural identity isn't always about blood. Many people identify with a culture they grew up in, even if their ancestry is different. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still feel part of that culture. The boyfriend's upbringing is Italian, so he might see himself as Italian by culture, not ethnicity. That's a common perspective.\n\nHowever, the author is bothered by the claim because they believe you need to have Italian blood to be considered Italian. This could stem from a belief that ethnicity is essential for cultural identity. But in many cases, culture is passed down through upbringing, environment, and personal identification. So the boyfriend's assertion that he was raised Italian might be his legitimate cultural identity.\n\nBut the author's anger could be valid if the boyfriend is being deceptive. If the boyfriend is actively claiming Italian heritage to appear as if he has the bloodline, that's different. However, the boyfriend clarifies he's not by blood but raised Italian, which is honest. The author might feel that cultural appropriation is happening, but since the boyfriend is immersed in the culture and identifies with it, it's more about cultural affiliation rather than appropriation.\n\nAppropriation typically involves using elements of a culture in a disrespectful or superficial way. The boyfriend has lived the culture, speaks the language, cooks the food, which suggests a deep connection. So it's more about cultural identity than appropriation. The author's issue is with the lack of blood relation, which the boyfriend acknowledges. The boyfriend isn't hiding the fact that he's not ethnically Italian but is raised in that culture.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's anger might stem from a different view on what constitutes cultural identity. If the boyfriend is honest about his background and the author is still upset, maybe the author should consider that cultural identity isn't solely based on ethnicity. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) if the boyfriend is being honest, but maybe A if the boyfriend is misleading. Since the boyfriend does clarify his situation, the author might be overreacting. But considering cultural perspectives, the boyfriend's identification is valid, so the author isn't wrong to feel upset, but perhaps the boyfriend isn't in the wrong either. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. If the author is being judgmental without considering cultural identity beyond blood, they might be in the right. So the answer is B.\n"
