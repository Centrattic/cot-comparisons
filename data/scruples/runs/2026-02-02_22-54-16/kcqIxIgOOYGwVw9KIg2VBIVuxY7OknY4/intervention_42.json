He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have any blood relation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, and he grew up in that environment, even learning the language. He identifies as Italian culturally but not ethnically.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural aspect. National identity can be complex. If his mother was raised in an Italian household and he grew up with that culture, maybe he sees himself as part of it. But the author is upset because he's appropriating the culture without any blood ties. Is that appropriation or just cultural appreciation? There's a difference. Cultural appropriation often involves taking elements from a culture in a disrespectful or stereotypical way, whereas here he's integrating aspects he was raised with. \n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. If his environment was heavily Italian, and he was taught the language and traditions, it's possible he feels a genuine connection. However, the author might feel that claiming Italian heritage without blood ties is misleading, especially if it's a significant part of his identity. \n\nI should think about whether it's reasonable to be upset about cultural misrepresentation. Some people do care about authenticity in cultural claims, especially if it's used to access certain privileges or communities. The boyfriend's actions might not be harmful, but the author's feelings are valid if she feels deceived. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response is dismissive: \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian.\" This could imply he's aware he's not ethnically Italian but still makes the claim. The author might feel that's insincere. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about something that matters to her. The boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong either if his identity stems from upbringing. But the key is whether the boyfriend misrepresented himself intentionally. If he's honest about his mixed background but still identifies culturally, the author's irritation is understandable. \n\nThe answer hinges on the context of their relationship and communication. The author's feelings are valid, but whether the boyfriend is in the wrong depends on his intent and how he presents his identity. Since the question is about the author's wrongness, and she's reacting to what she perceives as falsified claims, the answer is likely B. No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
