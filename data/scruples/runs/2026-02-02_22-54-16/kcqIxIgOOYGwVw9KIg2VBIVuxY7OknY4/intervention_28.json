He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is wondering if the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, but the author argues that cultural appropriation is an issue here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the nuances of cultural identity. The boyfriend grew up in an Italian household, learned the language, and even the curriculum had Italian. But since his biological family isn't Italian, does that matter? The author feels he's claiming a culture he doesn't inherently belong to, which could be seen as appropriation rather than just cultural appreciation.\n\nCultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It often involves taking elements of a culture as a dominant group without understanding its significance or respect for its origins. Here, the boyfriend is immersed in Italian culture through his upbringing, which might justify his connection, but the author feels it's not enough without blood ties. \n\nHowever, some people argue that cultural identity isn't solely based on biology. If someone is raised within a culture, they might consider themselves part of it. The boyfriend's defense is that he was \"raised Italian,\" which could be valid. But the author's discomfort is about authenticity and appropriation, not just personal identity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend is being honest about his roots but emphasizes his cultural upbringing, maybe the author's issue is more about the lack of biological connection. But cultural identity can be complex. The line between appreciation and appropriation is blurry here. The author's feelings are valid, but whether she's in the wrong depends on how the boyfriend's claims are presented. If he's transparent about his adoption into the culture, it's less problematic. However, if he's pretending to be ethnically Italian without acknowledging his background, it could be appropriation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The boyfriend's actions might be seen as appropriative, especially if he's emphasizing the cultural claims without the biological ties. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
