He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he's not ethnically. The boyfriend's mom was adopted into an Italian family, so he wasn't born Italian but grew up in an Italian household.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. The boyfriend identifies as Italian because of his upbringing, even without blood relation. Some people do form their identity based on how they were raised, not just genetics. So, the boyfriend might see himself as Italian because of his cultural environment, language, and traditions.\n\nThe author is upset because they feel he's appropriating the culture. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. However, in this case, the boyfriend is part of the community through his upbringing. It's not like he's from a different culture adopting elements superficially. He's immersed in the culture from a young age, which might make it more about cultural affiliation than appropriation.\n\nBut the author's perspective is valid too. They might value ethnic heritage and feel that claiming a culture without biological ties is misleading. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry here. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as authentic if he's lived the culture, but others might disagree.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's explanation is that he was raised Italian. Many people identify with the culture they grew up in regardless of ancestry. For example, adopted children often take on their adoptive family's cultural identity. So, the boyfriend's identity might be legitimate in his own eyes.\n\nHowever, the author's discomfort is understandable. They might feel that the boyfriend is not being truthful about his background. The key issue is whether claiming Italian identity without blood ties is acceptable. It depends on societal norms and personal beliefs about what defines cultural identity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way, as cultural identity can be complex. The boyfriend's actions might be seen as valid by some, but the author's feelings are also valid. The situation highlights differing views on cultural identity versus ethnic heritage.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author's feelings are valid, and the boyfriend's claim might be based on cultural upbringing rather than blood relation, which can be a point of contention.\n"
