He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and was raised Italian, but he himself isn't of Italian descent. The boyfriend identifies as Italian, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and is part of an Italian community.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural aspect of identity. In many cases, people who are adopted into a culture can grow up identifying with that culture, especially if they're immersed in it from a young age. The boyfriend's upbringing, environment, and experiences are all Italian, even if biologically he's not. So, he might genuinely see himself as Italian because of how he was raised.\n\nThen there's the author's perspective. She's upset because she feels he's appropriating the culture without being ethnically Italian. But the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. If the boyfriend is living the culture authentically, through family traditions, language, and community, it's more about cultural identity rather than appropriation. However, if he's using it for personal gain or to mock without any real connection, that's different.\n\nThe key points here are whether the boyfriend is being deceptive. The author says he doesn't have a drop of Italian blood, but his mother was raised Italian, and he grew up in an Italian neighborhood. So, his identity is rooted in his upbringing, which is a legitimate basis for cultural identity. However, the author feels he's faking it just because of the lack of blood relation. That's where the conflict lies.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response is that he was raised Italian, which is a common way people define heritage. For example, someone might identify with a culture based on upbringing even if their ancestry isn't purely that. So, the author's anger might stem from a belief that only blood relations can claim a culture, which isn't always the case.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel that her boyfriend is not being honest about his heritage. If the boyfriend is aware that the author feels this way and continues to claim Italian identity without clarification, that could be seen as insensitive. But if he's explaining his perspective and the author still feels wronged, it's a personal difference in values.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong (AITA), the answer hinges on whether the boyfriend's claim is legitimate. If he's not lying and is genuinely raised in an Italian culture, then the author's anger might be unfounded. However, if he's misrepresenting his heritage intentionally without acknowledging the distinction, that's different. The boyfriend does clarify that he's not of Italian blood but raised Italian, which seems honest. So, the author's issue could be with the concept of cultural identity versus blood relation, which is a valid perspective, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong because she's justified in her feelings about cultural identity, but it's a matter of differing viewpoints rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
