He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and spent time in Italy. The boyfriend grew up in an Italian neighborhood with Italian cultural practices, like cooking and language, but his father isn't Italian. The boyfriend says he's Italian because he was raised that way, but the author feels he's appropriating the culture without any actual blood relation.\n\nSo the key points are: cultural identity vs. biological heritage. The boyfriend is claiming cultural identity based on upbringing and environment, while the author believes that being Italian requires actual blood ties. The author is upset about cultural appropriation, but the boyfriend doesn't act stereotypically or overly. He's not pretending to be anything harmful, just identifying with the culture he was raised in.\n\nI need to consider the nuances here. Cultural identity can be complex. Some people argue that culture is about shared practices and upbringing, not just genetics. On the other hand, the author might feel that the boyfriend is being deceptive or not honest about his actual heritage. However, the boyfriend is upfront about his mother's background and the extent of his Italian upbringing. He's not hiding the fact that he's not biologically Italian; he's saying he was raised in that culture.\n\nIs it appropriation or is it cultural pride? Cultural appropriation usually involves adopting elements of a culture in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive of the culture's significance. But in this case, the boyfriend is immersed in the culture through family and environment. He's not just picking and choosing elements; he's been raised in it. However, the author's issue is that he claims to be Italian when he has no blood ties. That could be a point of contention, but it's also a matter of perspective.\n\nLegally or socially, there's no \"right\" to claim a culture unless you meet specific criteria. Many people identify with the culture they were raised in, even if they aren't biologically related. However, the author might feel that the boyfriend is misrepresenting himself, especially if others might see that as inauthentic.\n\nThe boyfriend's response about being raised Italian is a common argument in cultural identity discussions. But the author's perspective is valid if she feels that cultural identity should include biological heritage. It's a personal issue between them, and whether the boyfriend's actions are wrong depends on the couple's values.\n\nIn the AITA context, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is being honest about his background and the author is uncomfortable with how he presents it, maybe the issue isn't about right or wrong but differing views on cultural identity. The author isn't being unreasonable, but maybe the boyfriend isn't either. However, the author's feelings are valid, so she's not the asshole for being upset. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's justified in feeling that cultural identity should be based on heritage, and the boyfriend's actions might be seen as appropriation even if he's culturally immersed.\n"
