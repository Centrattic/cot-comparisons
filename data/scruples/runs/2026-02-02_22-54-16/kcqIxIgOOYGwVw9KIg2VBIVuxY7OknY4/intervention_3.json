He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without having any Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, and he was raised in an Italian household, but his father isn't mentioned as Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Cultural identity can be complex. If someone is raised in a culture, even without biological ties, they might identify with that culture. The boyfriend speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and is part of an Italian community. That's a significant part of his upbringing. But the author feels like he's appropriating the culture because he doesn't have any blood relation.\n\nThen there's the aspect of authenticity. The boyfriend says he's Italian because of how he was raised. The question is whether cultural identity requires blood relation. Some people argue that culture is about practices and upbringing, not just genetics. However, others might feel that claiming a culture without any ancestral connection is inauthentic, especially if they have no connection to the country or family ties.\n\nThe author's issue isn't with the boyfriend's behavior (no stereotypes or over-the-top claims) but with the claim itself. The boyfriend uses phrases like \"raised Italian,\" which the author doesn't accept. The key here is whether cultural identity is valid without genetic ties. \n\nLegally or officially, citizenship or ethnicity might require certain proofs, but in terms of personal identity, it's more subjective. The boyfriend's mother had no blood relation either but was raised Italian. So, if the boyfriend was raised that way, does that make his identity valid? The author might feel it's inauthentic because they don't share the same ancestral connection, but others might see it as legitimate.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking, speaking the language, being part of the community\u2014show a deep engagement with the culture. But the author's discomfort is about the claim of being Italian when there's no blood. It's a matter of personal values versus cultural identity.\n\nIn many cases, people can identify with a culture they were raised in, regardless of genetics. However, if the author feels that the boyfriend is being inauthentic or appropriating the culture without any ties, it's understandable. The answer depends on societal norms versus individual experience.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid concern about cultural authenticity. The boyfriend might be culturally connected but lacks the ancestral links, which the author finds problematic. So the answer is B.\n"
