He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for being upset with her boyfriend claiming to be Italian. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. He grew up in an Italian neighborhood and even had Italian classes until grade 8. He cooks Italian food, speaks the language to some extent, and identifies as Italian. The author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood and feels like he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, cultural identity can be tricky. Some people identify with a culture they're not ethnically part of due to upbringing. Like, someone raised in a household that practices a certain culture might feel connected to it. But then there's the question of authenticity. The boyfriend's case is that he was raised in an Italian environment, even if his mother wasn't born Italian. So he's taking pride in a culture that was passed down through adoption.\n\nThe author's issue is that he's claiming to be Italian without any blood relation. She feels he's appropriating the culture. But cultural appropriation is usually about power dynamics and disrespect, not just identifying with a culture you were raised in. If he's respecting the culture, participating in it genuinely, and not mocking or mocking others for it, maybe it's not appropriation. However, if there's no actual connection beyond upbringing, some might argue it's not genuine.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that if you were raised in that culture, especially in a place where it's dominant, identifying with it is natural. Language, food, traditions\u2014these can be part of one's identity even without blood ties. The boyfriend's case seems to be that he was immersed in the culture from a young age, so it's part of his identity.\n\nBut the author is upset because he says he's Italian when he's not ethnically. It's a matter of whether cultural identity is based on heritage or upbringing. If the boyfriend was raised Italian, even if his mother was adopted, he might see himself as Italian. The author might feel that claiming an ethnicity you don't have is misleading, especially if others are using it to connect or for other reasons.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response is that he's raised Italian, not by blood. But maybe the author wants him to acknowledge that he's not ethnically Italian. The boyfriend's quick to say he's Italian might make the author feel he's being inauthentic or misleading.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If cultural identity can be based on upbringing and environment, then the boyfriend isn't wrong to identify as Italian. But if the author values ethnic heritage as a necessary component of cultural identity, then she might feel he's appropriating. It's a cultural debate. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable for feeling this way.\n\nOn one side, cultural identity is personal and can be based on how you were raised. On the other, some might argue that claiming an ethnicity without biological ties is incorrect. The boyfriend's case is unique because his mother was adopted and raised in that culture, so he was too. But if the author feels it's appropriation, she's not entirely wrong to be upset. However, others might say that cultural identity isn't always about blood and that the boyfriend is embracing a culture he's connected to through upbringing.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's entitled to her feelings about cultural appropriation. However, others might argue that the boyfriend's identity is valid based on his upbringing. But the question is if the author is in the wrong for being angry. If she's not in the wrong, then B. If she's being too strict about cultural definition, maybe A. But I think it's a matter of perspective. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, I think the answer is B.\n"
