He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without being of Italian descent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised as Italian. The boyfriend himself was raised in an Italian household, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and grew up in an Italian neighborhood. The author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood but claims to be Italian. The boyfriend justifies it by saying he was raised Italian.\n\nHmm. Cultural identity can be tricky. On one hand, cultural appropriation is a real issue when someone from a dominant culture takes elements of a marginalized culture without understanding or respecting the context. But here, the boyfriend's family has been part of Italian culture for generations, even if they were adopted. His mother was raised Italian and that's part of her heritage. So maybe the boyfriend is claiming cultural identity based on upbringing and environment, not just blood.\n\nThe author's issue is about blood relation. But in many cultures, cultural identity isn't solely about genetics. For example, someone can adopt a culture through adoption or upbringing. So is the boyfriend appropriating it, or is he genuinely part of that culture through his family's practices?\n\nThe boyfriend doesn't act in a stereotypical way, which might reduce the issue. But the author feels he's faking it. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be thin. However, if the culture is part of his family's identity passed down through generations (even through adoption), that's more about cultural identity. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is that he was raised Italian, which is a valid point for some people. But the author values biological heritage more here. It's a personal value system difference. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way. \n\nIn many cases, people value different aspects of identity. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend's actions might not be entirely incorrect either. So, the answer might be B (No) because the author's feelings are valid, and the boyfriend's claim to Italian culture based on upbringing is debatable. It's a complex issue without a clear right or wrong.\n"
