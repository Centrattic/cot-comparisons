He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend claiming to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The author is upset about this cultural appropriation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend himself was raised in an Italian neighborhood and environment, even learning Italian in school. He takes pride in the culture, cooks Italian food, and so on. However, the author feels he's faking it because he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. So, the key points here are cultural identity versus ethnicity. The boyfriend's upbringing and environment are deeply rooted in Italian culture, even though his biological heritage isn't. The author is upset about him claiming the culture without the bloodline.\n\nCultural identity can be complex. Some people identify with a culture they were raised in, even if it's not their biological heritage. The boyfriend might see himself as part of Italian culture because of how he was raised. However, the author believes that cultural identity shouldn't be claimed without the ethnic background, leading to a conflict.\n\nI should consider if cultural appropriation is an issue here. Appropriation usually involves taking elements of a culture without understanding or respecting it. But in this case, the boyfriend was raised in that culture, so it's more about cultural identity. The author's frustration stems from the idea that you can't claim a culture just because you were raised in it if you don't have the blood.\n\nBut then again, many people identify with a culture they were raised in, even if they have mixed or no ethnic background. The boyfriend's case is unique because his mother's adoption into an Italian family and the neighborhood's influence made his upbringing highly Italian. So, maybe he does have a legitimate connection to the culture, even if not ethically.\n\nThe author is upset because the boyfriend doesn't have the blood, but the boyfriend's connection is through upbringing and environment. The question is whether that's sufficient for cultural identity. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the culture in his daily life, then maybe the author is being too strict. However, if the author feels that cultural identity should be based on ethnicity, then the boyfriend's claim is problematic.\n\nI think the key here is the definition of cultural identity. If it's about connection through upbringing and participation in the culture, then the author might be overreacting. But if the author values ethnic heritage as a necessary component, then the boyfriend's claim is an issue. Since cultural identity can be subjective, there's room for both perspectives.\n\nIn the end, the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling that way. People can have different standards for what makes someone part of a culture. However, the boyfriend's claim might be valid from his perspective, given his upbringing. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because their feelings are valid, but it's a nuanced issue.\n"
