He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend claiming to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. The author is upset about this cultural appropriation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian. He grew up in an Italian household, learned the language, and lives in an Italian neighborhood with Italian education. He doesn't act stereotypically, but he does claim Italian identity.\n\nThe author feels he's appropriating the culture. The boyfriend argues that being raised Italian makes him Italian. The key point here is whether cultural identity can be claimed without bloodline. \n\nCultural identity is complex. Some people identify with a culture they were raised in, even if they aren't ethnically part of it. But others might see that as appropriation, especially if it's for personal gain or image. The author is upset because he's taking pride in something he's not ethnically part of. \n\nHowever, cultural identity isn't solely about blood. Many people grow up in multicultural environments and identify with a culture they're immersed in. The boyfriend's upbringing in an Italian household might give him a legitimate cultural identity, even without the blood. \n\nBut the author's feeling that it's appropriation is valid too. There's a difference between respecting and participating in a culture versus claiming an identity that's not biologically connected. The boyfriend's insistence on claiming Italian heritage despite not having it could be seen as problematic, especially if he's using it to define his identity in a way that excludes those who actually are ethnically Italian.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is right to be upset. The answer hinges on the definition of cultural identity. If the author believes that cultural identity must be tied to ethnic heritage, then the boyfriend is wrong. If cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing, then the boyfriend is justified. However, the line between appreciation and appropriation is thin. \n\nIn this case, the boyfriend's actions might be seen as appropriate if he respects the culture and isn't mocking it, but the author still feels it's appropriation. The author's feelings are important, and they're not wrong for feeling that their boyfriend is misrepresenting his heritage. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
