He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable for the boyfriend to claim Italian heritage even though he doesn't have any Italian blood, just because his mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author is upset because her boyfriend claims to be Italian without any actual blood relation. He was raised in an Italian household by a mother who was adopted into an Italian family. He cooks Italian food, speaks the language, and is part of the Italian community. But the author feels that he's appropriating the culture because there's no blood connection.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend argues that he was raised Italian, which might mean that he identifies culturally with the Italian heritage even if he doesn't have the blood. So the question is about cultural identity versus ethnic/national identity. \n\nIn many cases, cultural identity can be strong without blood ties. For example, someone raised in a Korean household by adoptive parents might identify as Korean culturally even if they have no genetic link. So maybe the boyfriend's claim to being Italian is based on his upbringing and cultural practices rather than ethnicity. \n\nBut the author feels that this is appropriation because he's not ethnically Italian. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic, where someone from one culture adopts elements of another culture, sometimes in a way that's seen as disrespectful or dismissive of the original culture. However, in this case, the boyfriend is deeply immersed in the culture from a young age, so it's more about cultural affiliation than appropriation. \n\nThe line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the Italian community and practices the culture respectfully, it might not be appropriation. But if he's just taking elements for his own benefit without respecting the culture's origins, that could be problematic. However, the author's issue is more about the fact that he's claiming a heritage without blood ties. \n\nAnother angle is that national identity can be based on culture and upbringing. In some countries, you can claim national heritage if you were raised in that culture, even without blood ties. For example, someone born to immigrant parents might have dual cultural identities. So maybe the boyfriend's identification as Italian is valid in that sense.\n\nBut the author's anger stems from the idea that blood is necessary for being considered Italian. That's a common debate: whether ethnicity is about blood or about culture and upbringing. If the boyfriend's mother was raised Italian, then he was indirectly part of that culture through her. So maybe he's passing on the cultural traditions, which could be seen as legitimate.\n\nHowever, the author might feel that without a direct blood link, he's not authentically Italian. This could lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings. The boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian, which is a valid form of identity for some people. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author has the right to feel uncomfortable with the claim, but the boyfriend also has the right to identify with the culture he was raised in. The key here is whether the boyfriend is being respectful and whether the author's feelings are being acknowledged. \n\nSince the boyfriend isn't acting in a stereotypical way and is involved in the culture, maybe his identification isn't wrong. But the author's feelings are valid too. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. \n\nIf the answer is B (No), then the author isn't in the wrong. If it's A (Yes), then she is. Considering that cultural identity can be complex and that people can identify with a culture without blood ties, the boyfriend's actions might not be wrong. However, the author's feelings of appropriation might be valid if she feels he's exploiting the culture. But since he was raised in that culture, it's more of a cultural identity. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because her feelings are valid, but the boyfriend's identification is also legitimate. But maybe the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. If the boyfriend's identification is acceptable, then the author's anger might be unwarranted. Wait, but the situation is subjective. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling that way. However, culturally, some might say that cultural identity can be claimed through upbringing. \n\nThis is tricky. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's claim is legitimate, then the author is wrong to be angry. If his claim is inappropriate, then she's not. \n\nSince the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household and the mother was fully immersed, it's plausible that he can identify as Italian culturally. Therefore, the author's anger might be misplaced. But the author's perspective is that blood is necessary, so she might not see it the same way. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. The answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because her feelings are valid, but the boyfriend's perspective is also understandable. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the boyfriend's identification is based on upbringing and cultural practices, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the answer depends on whether cultural identification is sufficient. Given the complexity, the answer is B.\n"
