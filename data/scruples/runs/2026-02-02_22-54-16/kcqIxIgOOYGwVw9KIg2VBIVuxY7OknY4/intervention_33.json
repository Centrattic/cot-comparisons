He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without having Italian blood. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and grew up Italian. He was raised in an Italian household by her, learned Italian, cooked Italian food, etc. But the author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood and is appropriating the culture.\n\nSo the main point here is about cultural identity. The author feels that being Italian is about blood, while the boyfriend believes that being raised in an Italian environment makes him Italian. There's a difference in perspectives here.\n\nCultural identity can be complex. Some people might argue that culture is more about how you're raised and the practices you follow, not just genetics. On the other hand, the author might feel that without the blood, it's inauthentic. But is the boyfriend appropriating, or is he genuinely part of the culture through upbringing?\n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014speaking Italian, cooking Italian food, being part of an Italian community\u2014suggest a deep connection to the culture. However, the author's discomfort might stem from a belief that ethnicity is solely based on ancestry. \n\nIn many cases, people who adopt a culture become part of it through their practices and identity. For example, someone raised in a different country might identify with that culture even if they don't have the blood. But if there's a sense of appropriation, especially if the boyfriend is using it for social capital without acknowledging the lack of heritage, that could be an issue.\n\nBut appropriation vs. appreciation is a nuanced topic. If the boyfriend is honoring the culture he was raised in, it's more appreciation. However, if he's using it in a way that's dismissive of the original culture's significance, that's problematic. The author might feel that he's not being genuine.\n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend is being transparent. He says he's raised Italian but not by blood. If he's honest about that, maybe the author's issue is more about personal boundaries than the boyfriend's actions. The author might prefer her partner to be specific about his heritage, which is a valid preference.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction could be seen as being overly focused on genetic heritage, which some might argue is a narrow view of cultural identity. The boyfriend's upbringing and environment have shaped his identity, which is a legitimate way to claim a cultural identity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend is honest and the author is uncomfortable regardless, that's a personal issue. But if the boyfriend is being deceptive or appropriating in a harmful way, the author has a valid concern. However, the boyfriend's actions seem to be rooted in a genuine upbringing, not malice. Therefore, the author's upset might be about something that's not inherently wrong, but rather a difference in values. So the answer could lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's a close call. However, since the boyfriend is upfront about his background and the author's issue is more about personal preference, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any deceit involved. The boyfriend isn't lying about his heritage, just his cultural upbringing. So the author might not be in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend isn't in the wrong for identifying that way. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
