He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend who claims to be Italian without having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but the boyfriend himself isn't of Italian descent. He takes pride in the culture, cooks Italian food, and speaks Italian, but the author feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Cultural identity can be complex. Some people connect with a culture through upbringing, even without blood ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might identify with it. The boyfriend's case is similar: his mother was raised Italian, so he grew up in that environment. Maybe he sees himself as part of that culture through his upbringing and environment.\n\nHowever, the author might feel that cultural heritage isn't just about upbringing. Blood relation can be significant for some people when it comes to cultural identity. The author's frustration could stem from the idea that claiming a culture without biological ties is appropriation rather than connection. But appropriation vs. appreciation is a sensitive topic. If he's respectful and integrated into the culture (like speaking the language, cooking the food), it's more appreciation. But the author's main issue is that he's claiming Italian identity when he doesn't have Italian blood, which she finds problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. If his mother was immersed in the culture, and he grew up in an Italian neighborhood with Italian education, maybe he genuinely feels a connection. The line between cultural identity and heritage is blurry here. But the author's perspective is valid if she values biological heritage as part of cultural identity. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural perspectives. Some might say cultural identity isn't solely about blood, so the boyfriend isn't wrong. Others, like the author, might prioritize bloodline. There's no universal right or wrong here. However, the author's feelings are valid. She's not in the wrong for feeling that the cultural claim is misleading or inauthentic, especially if it's important to her. The boyfriend's approach might be well-intentioned, but if it causes discord in the relationship, both need to communicate better. \n\nSo considering all this, the answer is B\u2014the author isn't in the wrong. Her perspective is valid given her view on cultural identity. However, there's room for understanding the boyfriend's side too. The key is mutual respect and discussion. The author's feelings are justified, so she's not wrong.\n"
