He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. He was raised in a similar environment, with Italian culture, language, and food. The author is upset because he identifies as Italian without having Italian blood. The key issue here is cultural identity versus biological heritage.\n\nSo, the boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, which is a valid way to form one's cultural identity. Many people identify with the culture they were raised in, regardless of their ancestry. However, the author feels that this isn't enough to claim the culture. \n\nCultural appropriation vs. cultural appreciation might come into play here. But the boyfriend isn't appropriating; he was raised in that culture. The line between the two can be blurry. If he's genuinely part of the community and respects the culture, it's more of an adopted identity. \n\nThe question is whether the author has a right to be upset. If the boyfriend is transparent about his heritage but identifies with the culture he was raised in, then the author's anger might stem from a strict view of cultural identity requiring blood ties. But in many cases, cultural identity is more about upbringing and community than genetics. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014cooking Italian food, speaking the language, participating in cultural practices\u2014suggests a deep connection to the culture. While blood ties can be a factor, they aren't the sole determinant of cultural identity. The author might feel that cultural identity should be based on ancestry, but others might argue that lived experience and upbringing are just as valid.\n\nThe boyfriend's response about being raised Italian is a common way people express cultural identity. The author's frustration could be about authenticity, but if the boyfriend is living the culture, then his identity might be legitimate. However, if the author feels he's misrepresenting himself to others, that's a different angle. But since he's not acting stereotypically or disrespectfully, maybe the issue is about the author's personal values regarding cultural heritage.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) dynamics, the answer often hinges on intent and harm. If the boyfriend isn't causing harm and is being honest about his background, then the author's anger might be unwarranted. But if the author values biological heritage highly, their reaction is understandable. The community might say that culture can be adopted, so the author is wrong to be upset. Conversely, if the author believes cultural identity must be tied to ancestry, they could be in the right.\n\nBut generally, in discussions about identity, people often recognize that cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing. So the answer might lean towards B (author not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's claims are based on his upbringing and he's not hiding his background, the author's issue is with cultural identity criteria. However, if the author feels the boyfriend is appropriating without any connection, that's a different case. But since the boyfriend was raised in that culture, it's more about cultural identity through environment rather than blood. So, the author's perspective might be strict, but the boyfriend's identity is valid. Therefore, the answer could be B.\n"
