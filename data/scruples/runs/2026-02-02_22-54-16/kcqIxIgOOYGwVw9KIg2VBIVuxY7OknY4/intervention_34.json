He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims Italian heritage when he doesn't have any Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up with Italian culture, but the author feels it's appropriation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people argue that culture is about how you're raised and the traditions you follow, not just blood. The boyfriend is immersed in Italian culture, speaks the language, cooks the food, and is part of the community. That might be enough for him to identify as Italian culturally, even without ethnic ties.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of cultural appropriation. The author is upset because he's not ethnically Italian but is claiming the identity. Cultural appropriation often involves using elements of a culture without the lived experience of that culture. However, in this case, the boyfriend has been raised in that culture by his adopted Italian family. So it's a bit of a gray area. Is it appropriation or just cultural assimilation?\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's mother being raised in an Italian household is a key point. If she was fully integrated into the culture, then her son's upbringing is legitimate. The author's issue is about blood relation, but many cultures value cultural heritage over biology. For example, someone can identify with a culture they're raised into even without biological ties.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid if they value ethnic heritage strictly. But the boyfriend's perspective is that culture is about how you're raised. The question is whether it's wrong to identify with a culture you were brought into, even without blood. Legally and socially, many countries allow cultural identification beyond blood, like through upbringing or national identity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's stance is understandable, but the boyfriend's claim isn't necessarily false if he was genuinely raised in that culture. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend's position might be defensible as well. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the boyfriend's cultural identity is rooted in his upbringing, the author's anger might stem from a misunderstanding of cultural versus ethnic identity. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
