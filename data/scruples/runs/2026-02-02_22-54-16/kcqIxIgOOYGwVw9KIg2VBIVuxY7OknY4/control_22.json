He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend says he's Italian, takes pride in the culture, cooks Italian food, and hangs out with Italians. But the author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family, raised in an Italian household, bilingual, and the boyfriend grew up in a predominantly Italian area with Italian education. However, his father isn't Italian. The boyfriend argues that he's raised Italian even if not by blood.\n\nThe author thinks that just speaking the language or cooking the food doesn't make someone Italian. They feel the boyfriend is appropriating the culture. The boyfriend's response is that he was raised Italian. The question is whether the author is at fault for being upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are about cultural identity. Cultural identity can be tied to heritage, upbringing, and community. If someone is raised in a household with strong cultural practices, they might identify with that culture even if their bloodline isn't there. However, others might argue that cultural identity should be based on ancestry.\n\nThe boyfriend's case seems a bit stronger because his upbringing was deeply rooted in Italian culture. His mother was adopted into an Italian family, raised with Italian traditions, and he was part of an Italian neighborhood. This environment probably influenced his identity. But the author feels that without Italian blood, he's appropriating the culture.\n\nCultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It's different from cultural appreciation. If someone is adopting elements of a culture without the history or heritage, it can be seen as appropriation. However, if the person was raised within the culture, even without blood ties, it's more about cultural connection through upbringing.\n\nIn this case, the boyfriend wasn't just picking up bits here and there; his entire upbringing was in an Italian environment. His mother's adoption into an Italian family and their immersion in the culture (like the statue of the Pope, bilingualism) suggest a strong cultural identity passed down. So, his claim to being Italian might be more valid from a cultural standpoint, even without direct ancestry.\n\nBut the author's frustration is understandable. Blood can be a factor in some people's view of cultural identity. However, culture isn't just about blood. It's about how you were raised, the traditions you follow, and the community you're part of. If the boyfriend genuinely identifies with Italian culture and practices it, maybe he's entitled to that identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is about authenticity. They might feel that without the genetic link, he's not truly part of the culture. But cultural identity can be fluid and influenced by many factors beyond genetics. The boyfriend's upbringing and environment are significant contributors to his identity.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong to feel conflicted, but the boyfriend's situation is complex. The answer might depend on whether cultural identity is seen as strictly genetic or if upbringing and environment also count. Since many cultures recognize both aspects, the author might not be in the wrong for their feelings, but the boyfriend's claim could still be valid based on his upbringing. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (author not in the wrong) because the author's perspective is valid, even if the boyfriend's cultural identity is legitimate.\n"
