He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend who claims to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend himself was raised in that environment too, even though his father isn't Italian. The author feels that he's appropriating the culture because he doesn't have any Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Cultural identity isn't solely based on blood, right? If someone is raised in a specific culture, they can identify with it. For example, adoptees often identify with their adoptive culture, even if their biological heritage is different. The boyfriend's mother was in the foster system and adopted, so she's been part of the Italian culture her whole life. The boyfriend grew up in a household where Italian culture was emphasized, even though his father isn't Italian. So, he's been immersed in Italian culture, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, etc. That seems like cultural identity beyond just genetics.\n\nBut the author is upset because he's not \"blood Italian.\" She thinks that just cooking and speaking doesn't make him Italian. On the other hand, cultural identity is often about how you were raised and how you identify. So, if the boyfriend was raised with Italian traditions and identifies as Italian, is that appropriation or just cultural identity?\n\nCultural appropriation typically involves adopting elements of another culture in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive of the original culture. But in this case, he's been part of the culture since birth through his mother. He's not pretending to be Italian for some superficial reason; he was raised in it. So maybe it's not appropriation. However, if he's claiming to be Italian because of his upbringing, but the author feels that without blood, it's not valid, there's a conflict here.\n\nThe author's issue is about authenticity. She might value ethnicity as being tied to bloodline, which is common in many cultures. But in reality, ethnicity and cultural identity can be complex. The boyfriend's identity is shaped by his upbringing and environment, not just genetics. So, the author's anger might stem from a belief that cultural identity should be tied to blood, whereas the boyfriend sees it as part of his upbringing.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Maybe not. She has a right to feel that cultural identity should be based on blood. However, others might argue that cultural identity is valid regardless of blood. So, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for being angry. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the Italian culture through upbringing, then maybe the author's anger is misplaced. But if she feels it's inauthentic because of the lack of bloodline, that's her perspective. So, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. But according to the question, the answer is A or B. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide based on analysis. The key here is whether claiming cultural identity based on upbringing is acceptable. If the boyfriend was raised in the culture, even without blood, it's not appropriation. So the author's anger might be unfounded. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Another angle: the author is upset because he's faking it, but he's not faking it; he's part of the culture. So the author is in the wrong for being angry. Answer A or B?\n"
