He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment but his father isn't Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Cultural identity can be complex. People can identify with a culture they weren't born into if they were raised in that environment. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, learned the language, and is part of the community. So, does that make him culturally Italian, even without blood?\n\nThen there's appropriation versus identification. Cultural appropriation is usually when someone adopts elements of another culture without permission or respect, but here, the boyfriend is part of the culture through his upbringing. So maybe it's more about cultural identification rather than appropriation. However, the author feels that it's appropriation because there's no blood relation.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he was raised Italian. Many people identify with their upbringing's culture regardless of biology. For example, adopted children often identify with their adoptive culture. So, if someone is immersed in a culture from a young age, they might legitimately feel that's their cultural identity.\n\nThe author's issue is that he doesn't have Italian blood. But cultural identity isn't solely about genetics. It's about how you were raised and the culture you identify with. So, the boyfriend might be justified in identifying as Italian because of his upbringing, even if he doesn't have Italian ancestry through his father.\n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that cultural authenticity requires blood ties. But that's a narrow view. Cultural identity is multifaceted. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking the language, community involvement) suggest a deep connection to Italian culture, which is more about lived experience than genetics.\n\nHowever, there's a line where someone might be misrepresenting their heritage. If the boyfriend is claiming Italian identity to the point of hiding his actual ancestry or misleading others, that's different. But in this case, he's transparent about his mother's adoption and his upbringing. He's not denying his non-Italian father's side, just identifying with the culture he was raised in.\n\nSo, the author's anger might be valid if she feels her boyfriend is pretending to be something he's not. But culturally, identifying with a culture based on upbringing is legitimate. The boyfriend isn't appropriating but rather identifying with the culture he was part of. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling hurt, but the boyfriend's actions aren't necessarily wrong either. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's upset about cultural identity without blood ties, and the boyfriend's identification is based on upbringing, the author's perspective might not be the issue. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, but I need to check if there's a cultural sensitivity aspect where the boyfriend is misrepresenting himself. However, cultural identity is subjective, so the boyfriend's claim isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way.\n"
