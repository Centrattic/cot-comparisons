He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without actual Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian. The boyfriend himself was raised in an Italian household, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and lives in a predominantly Italian area. But the author feels that he's appropriating the culture because he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nSo, the question is about cultural identity. Can someone be considered part of a culture if they were raised in that cultural environment, even if they don't have biological ties? The boyfriend argues that being raised Italian makes him Italian. The author disagrees, thinking that blood is necessary.\n\nCultural identity can be complex. Some people believe that culture is about upbringing, language, traditions, and community involvement rather than just ancestry. Others might argue that heritage and blood ties are important components. The boyfriend's case seems to have strong cultural immersion: language, food, neighborhood, and family practices. However, the author feels that this isn't enough, which is why she's upset.\n\nI need to consider if the author has a valid point. The boyfriend isn't being racist or stereotyping, but the author feels he's falsely claiming a cultural identity. However, cultural identity isn't always strictly about genetics. Many people adopt and integrate into cultures different from their ancestry. For example, someone adopted by another culture might grow up with that culture as their own.\n\nBut there's also a line when it comes to appropriation versus appreciation. The author might feel that the boyfriend is not respectful or is taking aspects of the culture without the heritage, which could be seen as appropriation. However, if the boyfriend was genuinely raised in that culture, it's more about cultural upbringing rather than appropriation.\n\nThe key here is the concept of self-identification. In many cases, people identify with the culture they were raised in, even if it's not their biological heritage. So the boyfriend's claim to Italian identity might be legitimate from his perspective. The author's anger stems from a belief that blood is necessary, which is a point of contention.\n\nBut is the author wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the boyfriend was genuinely immersed in Italian culture and considers himself Italian, many would say that's acceptable. However, if the author feels that this is a misrepresentation, especially if there are cultural sensitivities involved, her feelings are valid. The issue might be more about how the boyfriend presents his identity and whether he's being respectful or exploiting the culture.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset, as cultural identity can be a sensitive topic. However, the boyfriend's perspective is also valid if he was raised in that culture. The answer might hinge on whether the boyfriend is being respectful and the context in which he claims the identity. Since the author's complaint is about appropriation and lack of blood relation, and given that cultural identity can be based on upbringing, the answer might be that the author isn't wrong.\n"
