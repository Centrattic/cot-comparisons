He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised as Italian, so he grew up in an Italian household. The boyfriend himself isn't of Italian blood but identifies as Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Sometimes people adopt the culture of their upbringing even if they don't have blood ties. For example, if someone is raised in a household where they learn the language, traditions, and customs, they might consider that part of their identity. The boyfriend's case seems to be like that\u2014his mom was raised Italian, so he grew up with the culture, even if he doesn't have Italian ancestry.\n\nBut the author is upset because he's taking pride in a culture he doesn't have blood ties to. She feels he's appropriating the culture. However, cultural appropriation usually refers to adopting elements of another culture in a way that's disrespectful or trivializes it. In this case, the boyfriend is immersed in the culture from childhood, so it's more about cultural affiliation than appropriation.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised that way, so perhaps the boyfriend's claim to Italian heritage is through cultural assimilation rather than genetics. The author's issue is that he doesn't have any Italian blood, but in many cases, cultural identity isn't solely about blood. For example, people can identify with their adopted culture or the culture of their upbringing.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the Italian cultural community through his upbringing, then it's his identity. However, if the author feels it's misleading, maybe there's a point there. But in many societies, cultural identity isn't strictly tied to genetics. So the author might be overreacting, but maybe not. It's a sensitive topic.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is clear that he's not by blood Italian but was raised that way. The author's problem is with his claim to the culture without blood ties. However, as long as he's not misrepresenting himself in a harmful way or disrespectfully, it's his right to identify with the culture he was raised in. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe the boyfriend isn't either. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the boyfriend's identification is based on his upbringing and cultural immersion, and the author is upset about it, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merit. However, given the options, the answer would likely be B (No) as the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend's actions might be considered appropriate.\n"
