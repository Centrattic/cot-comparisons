He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he's not ethnically Italian. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend himself was raised in a similar environment, with Italian culture, language, and traditions. He cooks Italian food, speaks the language to some extent, and grew up in an Italian neighborhood with mandatory Italian classes. However, he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nThe author is upset because she feels he's appropriating Italian culture without being ethnically Italian. The boyfriend argues that being raised in that culture makes him Italian. The key question here is whether cultural identity is solely based on ethnicity or can also be adopted through upbringing and environment.\n\nFrom what I know, cultural identity can be complex. People can adopt aspects of a culture through upbringing, even if they don't have ethnic ties. For example, someone raised by adoptive parents from another culture might identify with that culture. However, this can sometimes be sensitive if others feel it's inauthentic or if it's a form of cultural appropriation, especially if there's a lack of acknowledgment of one's actual heritage.\n\nIn this case, the boyfriend seems to have a genuine connection to Italian culture through his upbringing. But the author's issue is that he claims to be Italian without biological ties. The boyfriend's defense is that being raised in that culture makes him Italian. The author feels he's faking it, which is why she's angry.\n\nCultural appropriation can be a sensitive topic. If someone is adopting elements of a culture in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive of its origins, that's appropriation. However, if someone is honoring the culture they were raised in, even if not ethnically part of it, it might be seen as cultural appreciation. The line between the two can be blurry.\n\nIn this scenario, the boyfriend's mother was fully immersed in Italian culture from a young age, and he was too. So, his identification as Italian is based on his upbringing. The author might feel that without ethnic ties, he's not \"truly\" Italian. However, cultural identity is often self-identified. If the boyfriend grew up in that environment and identifies with the culture, many people would accept that as legitimate.\n\nBut the author's perspective is about authenticity and blood relation. She might feel that claiming Italian identity without it is inauthentic. This is a personal issue for her, and whether she's in the wrong depends on societal norms versus personal boundaries.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's possible that she's not. If cultural identity is self-determined, then the boyfriend's claim might be valid. However, if the author feels it's inauthentic, it's her right to be upset. The question is about whether she's in the wrong for feeling that way. \n\nSince cultural identity can be contentious and people have different views on what constitutes belonging to a culture, both perspectives have merit. However, the boyfriend's argument is that being raised in the culture is sufficient. The author's issue is more about the lack of ethnic roots. \n\nIn many cases, cultural identity is fluid and can be adopted. So the author's anger might be considered a personal opinion rather than being \"in the wrong.\" However, if the boyfriend is appropriating the culture in a way that's insensitive or erasing his actual heritage, that's a different matter. The key here is that the boyfriend's mother was raised Italian, so maybe he's following her path. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong if her feelings are based on the lack of ethnic ties, but if the boyfriend's cultural upbringing is sufficient for him to identify as Italian, then her being upset might be a personal issue rather than a moral one. However, since the question is about AITA (Am I the Asshole), if the community generally supports the boyfriend's right to identify with the culture he was raised in, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the community sides with her, then he's the asshole. Since I need to choose between A and B, I have to decide based on common perspectives. \n\nIn many cases, self-identifying with a culture based on upbringing is accepted, so the author might be overreacting. However, if the boyfriend is being inauthentic or appropriative, then she's justified. Given the details, the boyfriend seems to have a genuine connection through his upbringing, so the author might be in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised Italian, so she's culturally Italian. He was raised similarly. So he's following his mother's cultural identity. Therefore, from an external view, it's not entirely inappropriate for him to identify as Italian. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being angry about that. So answer A.\n"
