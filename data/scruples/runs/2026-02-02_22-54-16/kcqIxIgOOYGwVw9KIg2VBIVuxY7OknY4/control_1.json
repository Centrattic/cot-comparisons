He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family, and she was raised Italian. He grew up in that environment, learned Italian, cooked Italian food, etc. But the author is upset because he's not ethnically Italian and they feel he's appropriating the culture.\n\nSo, the question is about cultural identity. The boyfriend identifies as Italian because of his upbringing, while the author thinks you need to have blood to be considered that ethnicity. The main conflict is whether cultural identity is enough or if blood is necessary.\n\nI remember that ethnicity isn't just about biology. People can identify with a culture they were raised in even without blood ties. For example, adoptees often identify with their adoptive culture. So the boyfriend's claim might be legitimate based on his upbringing and environment.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might feel that cultural appropriation is an issue if someone is taking elements of a culture without a genuine connection. But in this case, the boyfriend has a deep connection through his mother's adoption and his own upbringing. He's not just taking surface elements; he's been immersed in the culture from a young age.\n\nThe author's problem is that they don't think being raised in a culture makes you part of it. But culturally, identity is often self-determined. The boyfriend's identification as Italian is based on his lived experience. The author might be right if the boyfriend was pretending without any connection, but here the connection is strong through family and environment.\n\nHowever, the author has the right to feel their feelings. If the boyfriend's claiming Italian heritage makes them uncomfortable, that's valid. But whether the author is in the wrong for being angry depends on if the boyfriend's claim is legitimate. Since he was raised in that culture, he's not wrong for identifying that way. So the author might be overreacting, but maybe not entirely in the wrong if the boyfriend isn't transparent about his background. However, the boyfriend's explanation about being raised Italian does address the author's concern, so the author's anger might be misplaced if he's already clarifying that he's not by blood but by upbringing.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about cultural appropriation, but the boyfriend's claim is justified by his upbringing. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance here. Wait, the boyfriend is being honest about his background. The author is upset because he's not ethnically Italian, but he's raised that way. So the author's issue is with cultural authenticity. Since cultural identity can be self-identified, maybe the author is wrong to be angry. But if the boyfriend is using it to appropriate without a blood connection, that's appropriation. However, since he has a strong cultural connection through his mother, it's more about cultural identity. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the boyfriend's claim might be appropriation, but the boyfriend's perspective is valid. Wait, but maybe the author is overreacting because cultural identity isn't about blood. So the author is in the wrong for being angry. Hmm. This is tricky. I need to check similar cases. In many cases, cultural identity is self-determined. So if someone is raised in a culture, they can identify with it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being upset because the boyfriend has a legitimate cultural identity. So answer A. But the initial thought was B. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is angry for the right reasons, they aren't in the wrong. But if the boyfriend's claim is legitimate, then the author is wrong. So the answer depends on whether the boyfriend's identification is valid. Since he was raised in that culture, it's valid. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for being angry. So answer A. But some people might think the opposite. Need to be careful. The key point is the difference between ethnicity (which can be self-identified) and race (which is biological). So the author's issue is with ethnicity being based on blood. But culturally, it's okay to identify with a culture you were raised in. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
