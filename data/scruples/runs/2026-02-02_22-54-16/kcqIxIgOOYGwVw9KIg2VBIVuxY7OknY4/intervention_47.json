He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he's not of Italian descent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and was raised in an Italian household. She moved to a predominantly Italian neighborhood, and the boyfriend grew up in a similar environment, even learning Italian in school. He cooks Italian dishes and participates in the culture, which is why he claims to be Italian.\n\nThe author is upset because he's not biologically Italian and feels he's appropriating the culture. The boyfriend argues that being raised in an Italian environment makes him Italian. The author disagrees, thinking that just being raised in that culture isn't enough to claim the ethnicity.\n\nNow, thinking about cultural identity and appropriation. Cultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. Generally, if someone is raised within a culture, even if not ethnically part of it, they might be considered part of that culture. For example, someone adopted into a different culture and raised with its traditions could identify with it. But when does it become appropriation versus cultural appreciation?\n\nIn this case, the boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, so the boyfriend was raised with Italian customs. He's part of the community, speaks the language, cooks the food. He's not trying to erase the original culture but living within it. However, the author feels he's falsely claiming the ethnicity without biological ties.\n\nBut ethnicity and identity are complex. Some people identify with a culture they were raised in regardless of bloodline. For example, someone of mixed heritage might identify more with one culture over another. So, if the boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, it's possible he genuinely identifies with it. However, the author's issue is about authenticity\u2014does being raised in that culture make him ethnically Italian?\n\nThe line between cultural pride and appropriation is blurry. If the boyfriend is respectful and doesn't mock or exploit the culture, it's more appreciation. But if he's claiming a heritage he doesn't have to gain something, that's appropriation. Here, he seems to be living the culture, not just picking elements for fashion or trends.\n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that the boyfriend is being inauthentic. But cultural identity isn't solely about genetics. Many people in adopted situations take on their adoptive culture's identity. So maybe the boyfriend is justified in his self-identification.\n\nHowever, the author has a right to feel that the boyfriend is misrepresenting his background. It's a personal issue, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. But whether the boyfriend is wrong depends on the perspective. If the boyfriend is using his cultural upbringing to claim Italian identity, that's his right. But if the author finds that misleading in their relationship, they might need to discuss the importance of biological heritage versus cultural upbringing.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. The boyfriend's situation is a bit of a gray area, but the author's feelings are valid. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
