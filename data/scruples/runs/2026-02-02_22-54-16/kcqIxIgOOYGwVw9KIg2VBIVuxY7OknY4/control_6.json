He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend who claims to be Italian without having Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend says he's Italian because his mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian environment. He was also raised in an Italian neighborhood and learned Italian in school. He cooks Italian food and speaks the language. The author feels he's appropriating the culture since he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend argues that being raised Italian is enough.\n\nNow, cultural identity can be complex. Some people identify by heritage, others by upbringing or culture. The boyfriend's case is a bit nuanced. His mother was adopted into an Italian family, so he's two generations removed from any biological Italian ancestry. However, he was immersed in Italian culture from a young age. \n\nThe author's issue is that he's claiming an identity that doesn't come from blood. But cultural identity isn't solely about blood. Many people identify with a culture through upbringing, even if they don't have direct ancestry. For example, adoptees or people raised in multicultural environments often have strong cultural ties.\n\nHowever, there's a line between cultural appreciation and appropriation. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the Italian community and respects its traditions, it might not be appropriation. But if he's using it for superficial reasons without acknowledging the lack of ancestral ties, that could be problematic. The key here is intent and the context in which he presents his identity.\n\nThe author's perspective is valid because she feels her boyfriend is misrepresenting his background. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his cultural upbringing justifies his identification. It's a matter of personal values and how one views cultural identity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's debatable. The author isn't wrong for feeling this way; she has a legitimate concern about cultural authenticity. However, the boyfriend's identification could be seen as legitimate if he's embracing the culture authentically. The answer hinges on whether claiming cultural identity without blood ties is acceptable. Since cultures are multifaceted and identity can be self-identified, there's room for both perspectives.\n\nBut the author's anger comes from the appropriation aspect. If he's not acknowledging the lack of blood relation and is using it to fit in or gain cultural capital, that's an issue. If he's simply proud of the culture he was raised in, it's more about personal identity. The situation is a bit of a gray area, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
