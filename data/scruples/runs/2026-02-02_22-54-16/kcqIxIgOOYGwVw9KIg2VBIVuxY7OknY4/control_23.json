He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at her boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in that environment. The author thinks that just because he was raised that way doesn't make him Italian, and she's upset he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture even if they don't have blood ties. Like, if someone grows up in a household practicing a different culture, they might feel connected to it. But others might see that as appropriation, especially if there's no biological link. But what's the line here?\n\nThe boyfriend's mom was in foster care and adopted by an Italian family, so she was raised Italian. The boyfriend, in turn, was raised in that same environment. His school even had mandatory Italian classes. So he's been immersed in Italian culture from a young age. He speaks the language, cooks the food, and has friends from that community. \n\nThe author's issue is that he claims to be Italian without any blood. She argues that just being raised in that culture doesn't make him Italian. But maybe the boyfriend sees himself as Italian because of his upbringing. Cultural identity can be complex. For some, culture is about heritage and blood, but for others, it's about how they were raised and their community. \n\nIs it appropriation here? Appropriation usually involves taking elements of a culture without understanding or respecting it, but the boyfriend seems to have grown up in that culture. If he's been part of it his whole life, maybe it's more about cultural identity rather than appropriation. \n\nThe author is upset because he's presenting himself as Italian when he doesn't have blood ties. But if he was raised in that culture, maybe he's entitled to that identity. However, others might argue that ethnicity is about ancestry, so without blood, it's different. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is \"I was raised Italian,\" which suggests he's prioritizing cultural upbringing over biological ties. The author doesn't like that, but maybe the boyfriend is valid in his self-identification. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's upset about something that others might see as the boyfriend's right to self-identify. But if the boyfriend is being honest about his background, maybe the author's anger is misplaced. However, some might side with her if she feels the boyfriend is being deceptive about his heritage. \n\nBut considering the situation, the boyfriend isn't hiding his story. He explains his upbringing. The author's issue is about blood vs. culture. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the boyfriend's perspective is about cultural identity, while the author's is about biological ethnicity. \n\nIn many cases, people's identities are self-defined, especially when they've grown up in a culture. So the author might be in the wrong for being upset about his self-identification. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong)? Wait, no. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong, then answer B. But if the author is in the wrong, answer A. \n\nHmm. Let me recheck. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user's post is from the perspective of the author. The AITA question is \"Am I the Asshole?\" So if the answer is the author is not in the wrong, then answer B. \n\nBut maybe the answer depends on cultural norms. In some contexts, claiming a culture without blood ties is seen as okay if you were raised in it. The boyfriend isn't pretending to be of Italian descent, just that he was raised in that culture. The author is upset about that. It's a personal issue, but if the boyfriend is honest about his background, maybe the author is overreacting. So the answer could be B (the author isn't in the wrong) because the boyfriend's claim is valid based on upbringing. Or A if the author is wrong to be upset. \n\nBut I think in this case, the author's perspective is valid. She feels that the boyfriend is appropriating the culture without being ethnically Italian. However, others might argue that cultural identity isn't solely about blood. So it's a bit of a gray area. But according to common AITA responses, if the person is being honest and there's no deception, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if cultural authenticity is important to the author, maybe she's not wrong to be upset. \n\nIn the end, since the boyfriend isn't hiding his story and the author is upset about a cultural identity issue that others might not see as a problem, maybe the author is in the wrong (A). But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: the author is right to feel that the boyfriend is not ethnically Italian, but if he's identifying culturally, that's his choice. So maybe the answer is B (the author isn't in the wrong). \n\nI think the answer is B. The author's perspective is valid if she's uncomfortable with her partner claiming a culture without blood ties, but it's not necessarily the boyfriend's fault. So she's not in the wrong. Hence, answer B.\n"
