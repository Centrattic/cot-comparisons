He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset with their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian despite not having Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend was also raised in such an environment, learned Italian, cooked Italian food, and lived in an Italian neighborhood. He doesn't act stereotypically Italian but still identifies as Italian. The author is upset because he doesn't have actual Italian blood and feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nThe key points here are cultural identity versus blood relation. The boyfriend isn't claiming ethnicity through genetics but through upbringing and cultural immersion. Many people adopt and identify with a culture different from their heritage, especially if raised that way. Cultural appropriation is usually about power dynamics and disrespecting a culture for personal gain, but here it seems more like cultural appreciation. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking the language, being part of the community) show he's integrated into the culture.\n\nThe author's issue is about authenticity through blood, but cultural identity isn't solely defined by ancestry. The boyfriend's mother's adoption into an Italian family and her upbringing in that culture, along with the boyfriend's own experiences, support his claim to Italian identity. The author's anger might stem from a misunderstanding of what constitutes belonging to a culture.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid. If the boyfriend's claiming Italian heritage is important to the author and they feel it's insincere, it's a relationship issue that needs communication. But the boyfriend isn't doing anything inherently wrong by identifying with the culture he was raised in. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset, but the boyfriend's actions aren't clearly wrong either. However, the question is about the author's fault, and since cultural identity can be complex, the author's perspective might not be justified. The answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they're not wrong for being upset about cultural authenticity, but maybe there's room for understanding the boyfriend's perspective. Wait, but some might argue the boyfriend is valid in his identification. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B, as the author isn't wrong for feeling this way. But others might say the boyfriend is just claiming culture he was raised in. I think the answer is B.\n"
