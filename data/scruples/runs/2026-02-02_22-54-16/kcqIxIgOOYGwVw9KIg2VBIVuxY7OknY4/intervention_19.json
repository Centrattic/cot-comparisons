He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without being Italian by blood. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood and learned Italian through school. He cooks Italian food and takes pride in Italian culture. The author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood and is appropriating the culture.\n\nThe author argues that just because someone is raised in a culture or speaks the language doesn't make them part of that ethnic group. The boyfriend, on the other hand, says he's Italian because of his upbringing. \n\nNow, considering cultural identity and ethnicity. Ethnicity often involves heritage, but cultural upbringing can also play a role. Some people identify with a culture they were raised in even if they don't have blood ties. However, cultural appropriation is a concern when someone adopts elements of another culture without respecting its origins or significance. But in this case, the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household by someone who was part of that culture through adoption. So maybe it's more about cultural assimilation.\n\nThe author's issue is about authenticity. They feel that claiming Italian identity without blood is wrong. But cultural identity can be complex. If someone is immersed in a culture from a young age, they might genuinely feel connected to it. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry here.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised Italian, so the boyfriend's connection is through her upbringing. Depending on how the community and the family present themselves, they might be considered Italian in some contexts. However, if the author values ethnic heritage as a key component of identity, then the boyfriend's claim might feel misleading.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author has a valid concern about cultural authenticity. However, cultural identity isn't solely about blood. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking the language) show engagement with the culture. The author's frustration is understandable, but whether it's a matter of right or wrong is subjective. \n\nIn many cases, people form their identity based on upbringing and environment. Unless the boyfriend is exploiting the culture in a harmful way, it might not be about being right or wrong. The author might need to discuss the importance of blood heritage in their relationship. However, the boyfriend's claim isn't necessarily incorrect if he identifies as Italian due to his upbringing. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend's stance is also understandable. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
