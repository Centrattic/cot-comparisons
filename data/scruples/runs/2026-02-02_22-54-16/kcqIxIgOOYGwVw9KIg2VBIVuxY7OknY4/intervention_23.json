He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family, so he grew up in an Italian household and environment, but his father isn't Italian. The boyfriend identifies as Italian and takes pride in the culture, even though he doesn't have direct Italian ancestry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. Some people might argue that cultural identity isn't just about blood but about upbringing and lived experience. If someone is raised within a culture, speaks the language, practices the customs, and identifies with that culture, they might feel entitled to claim it. That's especially true if they were immersed in it from a young age.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset because the boyfriend is appropriating a culture he's not biologically part of. Cultural appropriation can be a sensitive topic. However, in this case, it's more about cultural assimilation or integration. The boyfriend's family was part of the Italian community, so the line between appropriation and cultural identity might be blurred.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised Italian. So, the boyfriend's connection, while not through blood, is through a close family environment. If the boyfriend was raised Italian, maybe he does have a legitimate cultural identity, even if it's not through ancestry. But does that make it okay to claim Italian identity? Some people might see it as valid, others might think it's a stretch without biological ties.\n\nThe author's issue is that the boyfriend claims to be Italian despite not having any Italian blood. The boyfriend uses phrases like \"raised Italian,\" which suggests that identity comes from upbringing rather than ethnicity. The author believes that cultural practices alone don't make someone part of that culture. This is a common debate\u2014can someone who isn't ethnically part of a culture claim it based on upbringing?\n\nIn some cases, people who grow up in a different culture than their parents' can still identify with it. For example, if someone is raised in a household that practices a different culture, they might feel that's their cultural identity. So, if the boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, maybe he does feel Italian. But if the author perceives this as inauthentic because there's no blood relation, then there's a conflict.\n\nIt's also about how the boyfriend presents himself. If he's using the Italian identity in a way that feels inauthentic or misleading to the author, that could be a point of contention. However, if he's genuinely part of the Italian community and has lived the culture, others might not see an issue. The author's perspective is valid if they feel their partner is being inauthentic, but others might argue that culture isn't solely about blood.\n\nSo, the key points are: the boyfriend's upbringing in an Italian environment, the author's discomfort with cultural appropriation, and the debate over whether cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing. The answer hinges on whether cultural identity is determined by blood or cultural experience. If the community and upbringing define it, then the boyfriend's claim might be valid. If the author values blood ties, then they might feel it's inauthentic. Since cultural identity can be complex and varies by perspective, the author's feelings are understandable, but the boyfriend's perspective isn't necessarily wrong either. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given that the author has a valid concern about authenticity and cultural appropriation, but the boyfriend's claim is based on upbringing and environment, it's a nuanced case. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. In many modern contexts, cultural identity is seen as valid beyond bloodlines, so the author might be overreacting. But if the author feels wronged, their feelings are legitimate. However, in terms of wrongdoing, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, but the boyfriend's actions might not be inherently wrong either. The question is whether the author is at fault for being angry. Since the situation is subjective, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
