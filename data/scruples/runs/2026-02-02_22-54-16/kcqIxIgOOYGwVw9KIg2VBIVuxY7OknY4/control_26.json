He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mom was adopted into an Italian family, so she was raised Italian. The boyfriend grew up in an Italian neighborhood, learned Italian, and cooks Italian food. He says he's Italian because of his upbringing, not blood. The author feels he's appropriating the culture because there's no actual Italian blood.\n\nHmm. The question is about cultural identity. The boyfriend is emphasizing his cultural background even though he's not ethnically Italian. The author is upset about this. Is she in the wrong?\n\nCultural identity can be complex. Some people identify with a culture they were raised in, even if they don't have ethnic ties. But others might see it as appropriation if there's no connection. The boyfriend is raised in an Italian household, so maybe he's culturally Italian. However, the author might feel that being Italian is tied to ethnicity, not just culture. \n\nThere's also the aspect of appropriation vs. appreciation. If he's respecting the culture and integrating it into his life, maybe it's appreciation. But if he's using it to claim an identity without the heritage, some might see it as appropriation. However, the boyfriend's mom was raised Italian, so maybe there's a generational cultural transmission. \n\nThe key points: The author is upset about the claim to Italian identity without ethnic ties. The boyfriend is raised in an Italian environment. The author's issue is with cultural appropriation. \n\nIn some cases, people can identify with a culture they were raised in, but others might not agree. The author's feelings are valid if she sees this as inauthentic. But maybe the boyfriend's upbringing gives him a legitimate connection. \n\nI think the answer here depends on perspectives. The author isn't wrong for feeling this way, but others might argue that cultural identity isn't solely based on blood. However, the author's stance is about the lack of ethnic connection, so she might not be in the wrong. The answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
