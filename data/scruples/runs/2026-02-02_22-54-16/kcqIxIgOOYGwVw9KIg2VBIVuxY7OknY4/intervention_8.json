He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend identifies as Italian without having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but the author thinks he's faking it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. People can identify with a culture even if they don't have direct ancestry. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household, so he might feel a strong connection to Italian culture. But the author is upset because he's claiming to be Italian without blood relation. \n\nCultural appropriation vs. cultural appreciation comes to mind. If he's just appreciating and practicing the culture, maybe that's okay. But if he's using it to claim heritage he doesn't have, that's different. However, sometimes people in blended families or adoptive situations do take on the culture of their parents. The boyfriend's mother was raised Italian, so maybe he grew up feeling Italian even without the blood.\n\nThe author's issue seems to be about authenticity. They might feel that cultural identity should be tied to ancestry. But in many cases, especially with mixed backgrounds or adopted families, people identify with the culture they were raised in. So is the author wrong for feeling this way? Or is the boyfriend wrong for not acknowledging his non-Italian origin?\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's response is that he was \"raised Italian,\" which is a valid point. He might see his Italian upbringing as part of his identity. The author might not accept that, but others might support his right to identify that way. \n\nI think the key here is whether the boyfriend is being deceptive. If he's honest about his background and just takes pride in the culture he was raised in, maybe the author's anger is misplaced. But if he's hiding the fact that he's not ethnically Italian to pass as one, that's different. The question is whether the author is justified in being upset about something that's more about cultural identity than deception.\n\nIn the end, the answer might depend on perspectives. The author isn't wrong for feeling this way, but others might see the boyfriend's cultural identity as valid. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
