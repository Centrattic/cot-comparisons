He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he's not ethnically. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. She was bilingual and spent time in Italy. The boyfriend grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood, his school had mandatory Italian until grade 8, and he was raised in an Italian way by his mother. However, his father isn't Italian. The boyfriend doesn't act stereotypically Italian, but he claims to be Italian when discussing his upbringing with friends. The author is upset because he's appropriating the culture without being ethnically Italian, even though he speaks the language and cooks Italian food.\n\nNow, the author argues that just because he can cook and speak Italian doesn't make him ethnically Italian. The boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. The key here is the distinction between ethnicity and cultural upbringing. The boyfriend has no Italian blood, but he was immersed in the culture. So, is it okay to identify culturally even without ethnic ties?\n\nFrom a cultural perspective, some people might argue that if someone is raised in a culture, they can identify with it, even without blood ties. For example, adoptees or people raised by adoptive parents who maintain their birth culture might identify with that culture. However, others might see this as cultural appropriation if the person is not ethnically part of that culture and is using it for personal gain or identity without facing the associated challenges of that ethnicity.\n\nThe boyfriend's case is a bit different because he was raised in an Italian household by his adoptive mother. It's a mix of cultural upbringing and possibly a desire to connect with that heritage. However, the author feels that this doesn't make him ethnically Italian. The issue is more about the authenticity of the cultural identity claim.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend was immersed in the culture from a young age, speaks the language, and practices the traditions. On the other, the author feels he's faking it because there's no ethnic connection. It's a nuanced situation because cultural identity can be complex. Some cultures have terms for people with mixed heritage or those who adopt the culture without ethnicity, like \"cultural\" versus \"ethnic\" identity.\n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling that he's appropriating the culture without being part of it. The boyfriend might see it as a genuine part of his upbringing. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. If cultural appropriation is considered harmful, then the author's stance could be valid. However, if cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing, then the boyfriend's claim might be justified.\n\nAnother angle: The boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised Italian. If the mother is considered Italian by upbringing, then the boyfriend, raised similarly, might also identify as Italian. But since the author is focusing on ethnicity, which is different from cultural upbringing, the conflict arises.\n\nIn many cases, people can identify culturally without ethnic ties, but the line is blurry. If the boyfriend is using the Italian identity to connect with a community or heritage he's part of through upbringing, it's more about cultural identity. However, if he's using it to pretend he has a heritage he doesn't, then it's appropriation.\n\nThe author's perspective is that ethnicity matters here. The boyfriend's defense is cultural upbringing. Depending on cultural norms, both sides can have valid points. But if the author feels it's inauthentic because there's no ethnic link, she's not necessarily wrong. It's a matter of personal boundaries and how she views cultural identity.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her feelings are valid if she prioritizes ethnic identity over cultural upbringing in this context. The boyfriend's claim might be genuine from his perspective, but the author is within her rights to be upset about it.\n"
