He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family, and he grew up in an Italian household, but his father isn't Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, and immersed himself in the culture. Some people might argue that cultural identity isn't just about blood; it's about how you were raised and the culture you identify with. So, if he was raised Italian, maybe he has a right to claim that identity regardless of his ethnicity.\n\nBut the author is upset about cultural appropriation. They feel he's claiming a culture he's not biologically part of. Cultural appropriation can be a sensitive topic. It's different from appreciation. If he's genuinely part of the culture through upbringing, maybe it's not appropriation. However, if he's using it as a label without the heritage, some might see it as inauthentic.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: he cooks Italian food, speaks the language, and mentions his Italian upbringing. The author's issue is that he's claiming the culture without blood ties. But does blood matter in identity? There are cases where people adopt a culture they're connected to through family or upbringing. For example, adoptees might identify with their adoptive culture even if it's different from their birth culture.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother was adopted and raised Italian, so he was raised in that environment. He might genuinely see himself as Italian culturally. The author might feel that without the biological connection, it's inauthentic. But cultural identity can be complex. It's not just about biology but also about lived experience and community.\n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend is being respectful and accurate in his claim. If he's honest about his background\u2014like, \"I was raised Italian by my adoptive family\"\u2014then it's more transparent. However, if he's pretending to have Italian heritage to gain something or mislead, that's different. The author's issue seems to be with him asserting Italian identity without being of Italian descent, which the boyfriend justifies by saying he was raised that way.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's feelings are valid because they might feel that cultural identity should be based on heritage. But others might argue that cultural identity can be adopted. The boyfriend's situation is unique since his mother was adopted and raised in that culture. It's a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling this way, but it's a matter of perspective. The boyfriend's claim to Italian identity might be seen as legitimate by some, while others (like the author) might see it as appropriation. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether the boyfriend's claim is genuinely about his upbringing or if he's falsely claiming heritage. Given the info, the boyfriend is honest about his upbringing, so the author's anger might stem from personal values rather than the boyfriend being wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way.\n"
