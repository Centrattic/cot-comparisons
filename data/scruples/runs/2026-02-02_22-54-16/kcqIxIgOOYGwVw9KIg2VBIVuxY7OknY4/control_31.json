He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that their boyfriend claims to be Italian, but the author thinks he's faking it because he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised as Italian, so he grew up in an Italian household, learned the language, and so on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. The boyfriend is raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, cooks the food, and is part of the community. The author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood. But is cultural identity solely based on blood? I think cultural identity can come from upbringing and environment too. Like, if someone grows up in a culture, they might identify with it even without biological ties. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he was raised Italian, which makes him culturally Italian. The author's issue is that he's claiming a heritage he doesn't have by blood. But in many cases, people adopt other cultures and identify with them. For example, someone adopted into a different cultural family might identify with that culture. So maybe the boyfriend's claim isn't entirely wrong because he was immersed in Italian culture.\n\nHowever, the author feels that cultural appropriation is happening. But cultural appropriation is usually when someone from a dominant culture adopts elements of a marginalized culture in a disrespectful way. Here, the boyfriend was raised in that culture, so it's more about cultural identity than appropriation. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is being dishonest about his heritage, maybe the author has a point. But if he's just identifying with the culture he was raised in, then it's legitimate. The line is blurry here. The author's frustration is valid if the boyfriend is misrepresenting his heritage, but if he's just embracing the culture he was part of, then the author might be overreacting. \n\nI think the key is whether the boyfriend is being deceptive. If he's transparent about his background but still identifies culturally, the author's anger might be unwarranted. But if he's pretending to be ethnically Italian when he's not, that's different. The story says the mother was adopted, so the boyfriend's connection is through her upbringing. So he's culturally Italian but not ethnically. The author might be conflating cultural identity with ethnic heritage. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend's claim to Italian identity is also a matter of cultural upbringing. So the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't necessarily wrong, but the boyfriend's identification is valid based on his upbringing.\n"
