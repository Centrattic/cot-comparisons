He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims Italian heritage but doesn't have any Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised as Italian, but the boyfriend himself isn't of Italian descent. He's raised in an Italian environment, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and takes pride in the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Cultural identity isn't always about blood. If someone is raised in a culture, they can identify with it even without ethnic ties. However, the author feels that he's appropriating the culture because he's not ethnically Italian. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry here. \n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. That's a valid point because cultural upbringing can shape someone's identity. But the author is upset because he's claiming a heritage he doesn't have by blood. The key here is whether claiming cultural identity without ethnic roots is acceptable. In many cases, people who grow up in a culture can still identify with it, even if their ancestors aren't from there. \n\nHowever, the author's frustration is about authenticity. She might feel that his claim to Italian heritage is inauthentic because it's based on upbringing rather than ethnicity. This could be a matter of personal values. Some people believe that cultural identity is more about lived experience and upbringing. Others might think that without the ethnic background, it's not \"real\" in some way. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking Italian food, speaking the language, socializing with Italians\u2014show he's immersed in the culture. But the author is upset because he's not ethnically Italian. It's possible that the author values ethnic heritage more in this context, while the boyfriend values cultural upbringing. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's feelings are valid. However, cultural identity is subjective. The boyfriend isn't being dishonest if he was raised in an Italian household. The author might need to understand that cultural identity isn't solely about blood. On the flip side, if the boyfriend is using the Italian identity to claim something that's not his ancestral heritage, that could be seen as appropriation. \n\nBut appropriation vs appreciation: if he's embracing the culture respectfully and without mocking, it's appreciation. The author's issue is more about authenticity. However, in many modern discussions, cultural identity can be fluid. So, the author being upset might not be entirely wrong, but the boyfriend isn't necessarily in the wrong either. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether cultural identity is accepted as valid without ethnic ties. Since the boyfriend was raised in that culture, he might genuinely identify as Italian. The author's reaction is based on her perspective, which could be a difference in values rather than a clear right or wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but the boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong either. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's expressing a valid concern about cultural appropriation, but the boyfriend's cultural upbringing is valid, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). Wait, but maybe the answer is A? Because the boyfriend's cultural identity could be legitimate. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, if the boyfriend is not being honest about his heritage, but he's explaining his upbringing, then the author's issue is about his claim. But if he's explaining that he was raised Italian, then maybe the author's frustration is misplaced. But if he's saying he's Italian by heritage without clarifying, then he's being deceptive. The user says he beats around the bush when she complains. So he's not being clear. If he's not clarifying that he's not ethnically Italian when he makes claims, that could be dishonest. Therefore, the author is justified in being upset because he's not forthcoming. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). \n\nBut I'm a bit torn. The key is whether the boyfriend is appropriating or genuinely identifying with a culture he was raised in. If he's been raised in that culture, it's more about cultural identity. However, the author's feelings are valid. So the answer is B.\n"
