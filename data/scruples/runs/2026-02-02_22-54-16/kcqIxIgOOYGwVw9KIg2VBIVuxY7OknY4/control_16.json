He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their boyfriend claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he was too. The author is upset because he's taking cultural pride without actual heritage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people argue that culture isn't just about blood\u2014it's about upbringing, environment, and how you identify. If someone is raised in a household that practices the culture, they might feel a legitimate connection. The boyfriend grew up in an Italian neighborhood, learned the language, and was immersed in the culture. So maybe he sees himself as Italian because of that upbringing.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that cultural appropriation is happening. They think that without blood, he doesn't have the right to claim the culture. There's a line between cultural appreciation and appropriation. If he's just enjoying the food and traditions, that's one thing, but if he's using it to present himself as part of that culture without the heritage, that might be appropriation.\n\nBut then again, in many cultures, especially in places like the US, people often identify with their upbringing rather than genetics. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still feel connected. So maybe the boyfriend is just embracing the culture he was raised in. The author might be overreacting if they're not considering that cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing.\n\nHowever, the author's frustration is valid because they might feel that the boyfriend is misrepresenting himself. The key point is whether the boyfriend's claim to Italian identity is respectful or if it's exploitative. Since he's cooking authentic meals and seems to appreciate the culture, it's more about integration rather than mockery. But without blood, some might argue it's not rightful.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised Italian. So technically, his mother's connection is through her upbringing. If that's acceptable for her, then maybe the boyfriend's is too. But if the author is uncomfortable with it, maybe they need to communicate better. The boyfriend's response about being raised Italian is a common way people identify, especially in diasporas.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how cultural identity is viewed. If culture is seen as something you can adopt through upbringing and environment, then the boyfriend is justified. But if the author believes that cultural identity must be rooted in ancestry, then the boyfriend is appropriating. However, the author might be overly sensitive if the boyfriend's connection is through legitimate upbringing. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong if they feel cultural appropriation is an issue, but it's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have validity.\n"
