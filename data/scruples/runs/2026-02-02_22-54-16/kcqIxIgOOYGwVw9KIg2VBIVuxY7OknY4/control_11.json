He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a person) is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming Italian heritage when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, so he was raised in an Italian household, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Sometimes people identify with a culture they were raised in even without biological ties. The boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, so his identification as Italian isn't just about blood. The author is upset because they feel he's appropriating the culture without being \"genuinely\" Italian.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend is being honest about his background. His mother's adoption into an Italian family is a real connection, even if it's not genetic. Cultural identity can be about upbringing and community, not just ethnicity. The author might feel that claiming a culture without blood ties is inauthentic, but that's subjective. The boyfriend isn't pretending to be something he's not; he's sharing his upbringing and cultural experiences. The author's anger might stem from a personal belief about what makes someone \"truly\" part of a culture, which can be a sensitive topic. However, the boyfriend's actions (cooking, speaking the language) show engagement with the culture, which isn't appropriation if it's part of his upbringing. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the boyfriend isn't either. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the boyfriend's claim is based on cultural upbringing, and the author's feelings are valid.\n"
