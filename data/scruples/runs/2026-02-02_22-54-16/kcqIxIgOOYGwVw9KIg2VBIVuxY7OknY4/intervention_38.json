He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend grew up in that environment too, even learned Italian in school, and embraces the culture.\n\nSo the author's main issue is cultural appropriation. They feel that the boyfriend is claiming an identity he doesn't have. But is that fair? Let's think about cultural identity. People can have strong cultural identities even without ethnic background. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still identify with it if they were raised that way. The boyfriend speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and was immersed in the culture. That's not just appropriation; it's more like cultural integration through upbringing.\n\nBut wait, the author argues that you need blood to be considered part of the culture. That's a common debate. Some people believe cultural identity is about how you were raised, not just genetics. Others think genetics matter. There's no universal answer. The boyfriend isn't denying his biological heritage; he's acknowledging his mother's adoption but still identifies with the culture she was part of. That's a bit of a gray area. However, if he's being honest about his background and just embracing the culture he was raised in, maybe the author's issue is more about personal values than actual wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend doesn't act stereotypically. He's not mocking the culture or using it in a harmful way. He's just proud of the way he was raised. So maybe the author is overreacting. But if the author feels disrespected or that the boyfriend is being deceptive, that's valid too. It's a relationship issue where communication might help. But in terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend isn't exactly \"faking\" it if he was raised in that environment. The author's perspective is valid, but the boyfriend's identity is also real in his context. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
