He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without being born into the culture. The context is that the boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised Italian, but he himself isn't ethnically Italian.\n\nFirst, cultural identity can be complex. The boyfriend's upbringing involved Italian culture\u2014language, food, community\u2014but his ethnicity isn't Italian. The author feels he's appropriating the culture by claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend argues that being raised in that environment makes him Italian culturally.\n\nThe key here is the distinction between cultural identity and ethnicity. Some might argue that cultural upbringing can form part of one's identity, so if someone is immersed in a culture from a young age, they can identify with it. Others might think that ethnicity is more about biological heritage. The author's issue is with cultural appropriation, where someone from a different background adopts elements of another culture without shared heritage.\n\nThe boyfriend doesn't act stereotypically, but he does claim Italian identity. The author feels this is insincere. It's a matter of perspective. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the Italian community and respects the culture, some might see his identification as valid. However, if the author feels it's a misrepresentation, especially if there's a lack of ethnic connection, that's a valid concern.\n\nThe author isn't wrong for feeling this way. Cultural sensitivity varies, and not everyone may agree on what's acceptable. The boyfriend's defense that being raised in an Italian household makes him Italian might not address the author's concerns about authenticity. The answer hinges on whether cultural upbringing can justify ethnic claims. Since there's no clear right or wrong in subjective identity claims, the author's feelings are valid, making them not in the wrong.\n"
