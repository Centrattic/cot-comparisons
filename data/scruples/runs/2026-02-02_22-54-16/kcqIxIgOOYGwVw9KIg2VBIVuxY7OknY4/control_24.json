He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without having Italian blood. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised as Italian. The boyfriend himself was raised in an Italian household, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. But he doesn't have any Italian blood. The author is upset because he's claiming to be Italian, which she sees as cultural appropriation.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. So, is it acceptable for someone to identify with a culture they were raised in, even without blood relation? Cultural identity can be complex. Some people might argue that if you were raised in a culture, you can identify with it. Others might say that without ancestral ties, it's appropriation.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's side, he was immersed in Italian culture from a young age. His mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised bilingual. So he might genuinely feel a connection to that culture. The author's issue is that he doesn't have any Italian blood, but does that matter? Blood relation isn't the only way to connect to a culture. However, the author feels it's important that he doesn't have that biological link, which is causing her discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning is that being raised Italian is enough. He doesn't act stereotypically, but he still identifies as Italian. The author's anger is about authenticity and appropriation. She might feel that cultural identity should be based on heritage, not just upbringing. \n\nCultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. If someone is adopting elements of a culture they don't belong to, especially in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive of the original culture, it can be problematic. But in this case, the boyfriend was raised in that culture. It's more about cultural affiliation through upbringing rather than appropriation. \n\nHowever, the author's perspective is valid. She might be concerned about authenticity in relationships and how he presents himself. If he's claiming an identity that he can't fully claim due to no blood relation, that could be a point of contention. \n\nBut then again, cultural identity isn't solely about blood. Many people identify with cultures they were raised in. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still identify with that culture. So, maybe the boyfriend's identification is legitimate from his perspective. \n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend is being deceptive. If he's transparent about his background and just identifies with the culture he was raised in, it might not be an issue. However, if he's misrepresenting himself as having Italian heritage when he doesn't, that's a different matter. The author's problem is that he claims to be Italian without any blood relation, which could be seen as inauthentic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author has a right to feel that her boyfriend's claims are inauthentic and possibly appropriative. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might feel that his cultural upbringing justifies his identification. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's expressing her discomfort with him claiming a cultural identity he doesn't have a biological connection to. However, the boyfriend's perspective isn't entirely without merit either. The answer would depend on whether cultural identity can be based solely on upbringing. If the boyfriend's identification is genuine and respectful, then the author might be overreacting. But if he's using it in a way that's disrespectful or misleading, then she's justified.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's not acting disrespectfully but is upset about the authenticity of his claim, it's more about differing views on cultural identity. There's no clear right or wrong here. However, the author's stance is valid based on her values. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's within her right to feel that her boyfriend's claim is inauthentic.\n"
