He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian without being of Italian descent. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, so he grew up in an Italian household but doesn't have Italian blood. The author feels that cultural appropriation is happening here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nuances. Cultural identity can be complex. Some people identify with a culture based on upbringing, even if they don't share the bloodline. The boyfriend is part of the Italian community through his mother's adoption and was raised in that culture. So, he might genuinely feel Italian in his daily life, even if he's not ethnically Italian.\n\nBut the author is upset because they believe only people with Italian ancestry can claim the culture. That raises the question of what defines cultural identity. Is it solely about ancestry, or can it be about upbringing and lived experience? The boyfriend's case seems more about the latter. He was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, which could give him a legitimate connection to it. However, some might argue that without blood ties, it's appropriation rather than identification.\n\nCultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It often involves a marginalized group's culture being adopted by a dominant group for fashion or aesthetics. In this case, the boyfriend is part of the Italian community through his upbringing, which might not fit the typical definition of appropriation. But the author's discomfort is valid because they feel the culture is being misrepresented or claimed without the heritage.\n\nThe boyfriend's response that he was \"raised Italian\" suggests he sees his identity as valid through that upbringing. The author, however, values bloodline and heritage as the basis for cultural identity. This is a common point of contention. It's important to recognize both perspectives: the boyfriend's lived cultural experience versus the author's emphasis on ancestral ties.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for feeling this way, especially if they value authenticity rooted in heritage. However, the boyfriend isn't wrong for identifying with the culture he was raised in. It's more about differing views on what constitutes cultural identity. So, neither side is entirely in the wrong, but the author's feelings are understandable. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings, but it's a nuanced situation without a clear right or wrong.\n"
