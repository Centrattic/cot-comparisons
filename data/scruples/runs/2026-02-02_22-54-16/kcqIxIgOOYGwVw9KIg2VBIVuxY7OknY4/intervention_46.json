He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and grew up with that culture, so he was raised in an Italian household. The author is bothered by the cultural appropriation aspect.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definition of cultural appropriation. It's when someone from a dominant culture adopts elements from a marginalized culture without understanding or respecting its significance. But in this case, the boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, learned the language, and immersed in the culture. So, maybe that's more like cultural assimilation or passing as Italian rather than appropriation. Wait, the mother was adopted and raised as Italian, so maybe he's not ethnically Italian but culturally connected through his upbringing. \n\nThe user is arguing that just because he can cook and speak Italian doesn't make him Italian. But the boyfriend is identifying with the culture passed down to him by his mother. There's a nuance here between ethnic identity and cultural identity. If the mother was raised Italian and passed that culture to him, is he wrong to identify as Italian? Some people might say yes, because ethnicity is about bloodline. Others might say no, because culture can be adopted through upbringing. \n\nThe author's main issue is with the boyfriend claiming Italian identity without actual heritage. But if the boyfriend has grown up in that culture, maybe he feels a legitimate connection. However, the term \"cultural appropriation\" is often used when there's a power imbalance and elements are taken superficially. Here, the boyfriend is deeply embedded in the culture through his family, which might be more like cultural inheritance. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for feeling that their boyfriend is misrepresenting his heritage. But is the boyfriend in the wrong? That's debatable. If the community where he grew up accepts his identity, maybe it's not appropriation. However, if the author feels it's misleading, especially in contexts like family discussions or when it matters for heritage, that's a valid concern. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's stance is that the author isn't, and they want to know if I agree. The answer depends on how we view cultural identity versus bloodline. Since the boyfriend's mother was raised Italian and he grew up in that environment, some might argue that he has a cultural claim. However, the author's discomfort is understandable if they see it as an inauthentic claim. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the boyfriend's cultural claim without ethnic ties. It's a matter of perspective on what defines cultural identity.\n"
