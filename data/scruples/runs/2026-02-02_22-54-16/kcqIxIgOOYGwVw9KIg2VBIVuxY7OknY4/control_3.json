He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but he himself isn't of Italian descent. The boyfriend grew up in an Italian neighborhood and learned Italian, so he identifies as Italian.\n\nHmm. So the question is about cultural appropriation or identity. The author feels that the boyfriend is faking being Italian because he doesn't have Italian blood. But the boyfriend was raised in an Italian environment, so he might feel a connection to the culture through upbringing rather than ancestry.\n\nCultural identity isn't always about blood. Some people adopt cultures they grow up in, especially if they're immersed in them. Like, if someone is raised in a household where they speak the language, celebrate traditions, etc., they might identify with that culture even if they're not ethnically part of it. But others might see it as appropriation if they're not part of the community by ancestry.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration makes sense. They might feel like their boyfriend is being dishonest or minimizing their own background by claiming another culture. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry. The boyfriend might be genuinely connected to Italian culture through his upbringing, but the author sees it as falsifying his identity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the boyfriend was raised in that environment and identifies with the culture, he's not necessarily wrong to say he's Italian. But the author's feelings are valid too. They might feel that ethnic identity should be tied to ancestry. It's a complex issue. The answer probably depends on context, but in this case, the boyfriend's close connection to Italian culture through upbringing might justify his identification. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being upset about it. But maybe not, because cultural identity can be sensitive. Wait, but if he doesn't have any blood relation, does that matter? Maybe in some communities it's more about culture than blood. I think the answer here is that the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid concern about someone claiming a culture they aren't part of genetically. But again, cultural identity is multifaceted. Maybe there's a middle ground, but the question is about right or wrong. I'll go with B, the author is not in the wrong because the boyfriend's claim to Italian identity might be seen as appropriation if he doesn't have the ancestral roots, even if he was raised in that culture.\n"
