He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom was adopted into an Italian family and raised Italian. He grew up in an Italian neighborhood and learned Italian. The author feels he's appropriating the culture because he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend argues he was raised Italian.\n\nSo, the question is about cultural identity. Does cultural upbringing count as being part of that culture, even without blood ties? Some people argue that culture is more than just genetics\u2014you can adopt aspects of a culture through upbringing, environment, and personal connection. On the other hand, others might feel that claiming heritage without biological ties is appropriation or misleading.\n\nThe author's issue is with the boyfriend presenting himself as Italian. If the boyfriend is immersed in the culture, speaks the language, cooks the food, etc., maybe he's culturally Italian. But the author is upset about the lack of blood relation. However, cultural identity isn't solely based on biology. It's possible to have a strong cultural identity without ethnic ties. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong either. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on societal norms around cultural identity. Since cultural identity can be self-identified, the boyfriend's claim might be valid. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but maybe the situation isn't a clear right or wrong. But the options are A or B. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
