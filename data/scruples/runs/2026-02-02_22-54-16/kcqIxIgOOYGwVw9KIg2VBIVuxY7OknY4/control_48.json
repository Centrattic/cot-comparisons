He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend who claims to be Italian despite not having any Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised as Italian, so the boyfriend grew up in an Italian household. His mother is bilingual and they even had an Italian statue. But the boyfriend has no actual Italian blood. The author is upset because he claims to be Italian and the author feels he's appropriating the culture.\n\nSo, the key points here are cultural identity versus biological heritage. The boyfriend identifies as Italian because of his upbringing, but the author thinks that's not sufficient. The author's issue is that he doesn't have the blood, so claiming Italian heritage is appropriation. The boyfriend argues that he was raised Italian, which gives him the right to identify as such.\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author is wrong. Cultural identity can be complex. Some people adopt cultures through upbringing and feel a connection even without biological ties. However, if someone is using that identity in a way that's misleading or dismissive of the actual culture, that could be problematic. The author's anger might stem from feeling that the boyfriend is inauthentic or not respecting the culture's significance.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend is genuinely connected to the culture through his upbringing, maybe the author's issue is more about the lack of bloodline. However, cultural identity isn't always tied to blood. On the other hand, if the boyfriend is making claims that ignore the historical or biological aspects of Italian identity, that could be appropriation. Appropriation can be harmful if it trivializes the culture or if the person is benefiting from it without the shared history of oppression or connection.\n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian. So, maybe he does have a legitimate connection through his upbringing. The author might be overreacting if the boyfriend is embracing the culture respectfully. But if the author feels that the boyfriend is pretending without any real link beyond upbringing, maybe the author is justified.\n\nI think the answer here hinges on the distinction between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation. If the boyfriend is appreciating the culture he was raised in, that's different from appropriating it for superficial reasons. The fact that his mother was adopted into an Italian family and he grew up in that environment might make his identity as Italian valid. The author's anger might be misplaced if the boyfriend is authentically connected to the culture. However, if there's a sense of insincerity or exploitation, then the author's feelings could be valid.\n\nIn the end, cultural identity is personal. If the boyfriend identifies as Italian because of his upbringing, many would support that. The author's issue is more about the lack of blood relation, but blood isn't always the sole determinant of cultural identity. Therefore, the author might be in the right if the boyfriend is genuinely connected to the culture. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I need to check again. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B, then the author is not in the wrong. But maybe some would argue the author is being too strict about blood ties. However, the boyfriend's upbringing gives him a cultural connection. So perhaps the author is overreacting. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B, then the author is not in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn here. The boyfriend's claim to Italian heritage is based on upbringing, which some might see as legitimate. The author's anger might be about the lack of blood, but blood isn't the only way to claim a culture. However, if the boyfriend is pretending to have a heritage for showy reasons (like when hanging out with friends), that could be appropriation. The answer might depend on context. Since the boyfriend was raised in that culture, maybe the author is wrong to be angry. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the author is wrong. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. I think the key is cultural identity. If the boyfriend was raised in an Italian household and has a strong connection, he can identify as Italian. The author's issue is about bloodline, but that's not the only factor. Therefore, the author might be wrong to be angry. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong). But others might say that without blood, it's appropriation. I'm not sure. It's a cultural issue with no clear right or wrong. However, the boyfriend's upbringing makes his identity valid. So the author is wrong to be upset. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
