He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The author is upset about the cultural appropriation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian. The boyfriend grew up in an Italian household, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. The author feels he's appropriating the culture by claiming to be Italian without actual blood ties. The boyfriend responds that he was raised Italian, not by blood.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Cultural identity can be complex. If someone is raised in a culture, even without blood relations, do they have the right to identify with that culture? The boyfriend's upbringing is deeply embedded in Italian culture, so he might consider himself part of it. The author is upset about the claim of being Italian without blood, but is that a valid reason for anger?\n\nCultural appropriation vs. cultural appreciation. The boyfriend isn't caricaturing the culture; he's embracing it through food, language, etc. If he's been raised that way, maybe it's not appropriation. The author's issue is about not having blood, but cultural identity isn't solely about blood. However, the author might feel that the boyfriend is misrepresenting his heritage.\n\nIs the author justified in her anger? It depends on perspectives. Some people believe cultural identity is about upbringing and not just ancestry. Others might think that claiming heritage without blood is misleading. The boyfriend's response is that he was raised that way, so he considers himself Italian. The author might feel that blood is important for cultural legitimacy.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing. If yes, then the author is in the wrong (AITA: No, B). If no, the author is right (ITA, A). But in many cases, people who are adopted into a culture are considered part of it. The boyfriend's deep involvement in Italian culture suggests he's part of it, even without blood. The author's anger might be about a personal value on ancestry, which is valid, but not necessarily making her the asshole. The boyfriend might not be wrong either. But the AITA community often sides with people who have adopted cultures, so the author might be in the wrong for being angry. So the answer might be B.\n"
