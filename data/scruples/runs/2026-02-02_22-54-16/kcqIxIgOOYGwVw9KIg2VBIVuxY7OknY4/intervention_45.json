He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's background: his mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend himself grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood and had mandatory Italian education until grade 8. He doesn't have Italian blood but was immersed in the culture, cooks Italian food, speaks the language, and presents himself as Italian. The author is upset because he claims to be Italian without any actual blood relation, and the boyfriend responds with things like \"not by blood but raised Italian.\"\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about cultural identity and appropriation. The boyfriend was raised in an Italian household by his adoptive mother, so he's been part of the culture, even without blood ties. But the author feels that this cultural participation doesn't make him ethnically Italian. \n\nCultural appropriation vs. cultural appreciation is a sensitive topic. However, in this case, the boyfriend's adoption into the culture through family and community might mean that he does identify with it authentically. The fact that he was raised in an Italian environment, learned the language, and even has a bilingual background from his mother could mean that his identification as Italian is legitimate in a cultural sense, even if not genetically.\n\nBut the author's frustration is valid because some people consider ethnicity to be tied to ancestry. The boyfriend's claim might be seen as appropriative if he's using the culture for identity without the connection. However, the boyfriend's upbringing and environment might be enough for him to feel a genuine connection. \n\nThe boyfriend's response (\"raised Italian\") suggests he's aware of the distinction but sees cultural upbringing as sufficient. The author's anger comes from the belief that cultural participation alone isn't enough to claim the identity. It's a matter of perspective: does cultural immersion and upbringing count as being part of the culture, or is genetic lineage necessary?\n\nIn many cases, especially in diaspora communities, people identify with a culture they were raised in, even without direct ancestry. The boyfriend's case seems more about cultural inheritance from his adoptive family, which could be seen as valid in some contexts. However, if the author feels this is appropriation, there's a valid point there too. But is the author in the wrong for feeling that way?\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether cultural identity can be adopted through upbringing. If the boyfriend was genuinely immersed in the culture and internalizes it as part of his identity, then his claim might be reasonable. However, if he's using it superficially or in a way that trivializes the culture, it could be appropriation. The post doesn't indicate that he's being disrespectful, just that he identifies with the culture he was raised in. \n\nGiven that the boyfriend's family adopted the culture, and he grew up in an Italian neighborhood, his identification as Italian could be seen as legitimate in terms of cultural upbringing. Therefore, the author might be overreaching in their anger if they're not considering the cultural aspects of identity beyond genetics. However, the author's feelings are valid because they value biological ancestry as part of cultural identity. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend's identification is based on genuine cultural upbringing, then the author might be the one being overly rigid. So, the answer could lean towards B (author not in the wrong) if we consider that cultural identity shouldn't be claimed without blood ties. But there's also the counterpoint that cultural identity can be adopted through environment. \n\nI think the key is that the author's feelings are valid, but the boyfriend's identification could be seen as legitimate. However, if the author believes that claiming Italian identity without blood ties is appropriation, they're not in the wrong for feeling that way. But whether they're in the wrong for being angry depends on whether the boyfriend's actions are actually problematic. If the boyfriend isn't harming anyone and is genuinely part of the culture through upbringing, the author's anger might be misplaced. However, if the author sees this as inauthentic, then they might not be in the wrong. \n\nThis is a bit of a grey area. Given the context, I think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's lack of Italian blood might make the author's stance reasonable, especially if they view cultural identity as tied to ancestry. However, others might argue that cultural identity can be adopted, making the author in the wrong. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the boyfriend's situation is complex, the answer leans towards B.\n"
