He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian.\n\nSo the boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised as Italian, but the boyfriend himself isn't of Italian descent. The boyfriend claims to be Italian, which the author is upset about. The boyfriend says he was raised Italian, which is why he identifies that way. The author thinks that just because you can cook Italian food and speak the language doesn't make you Italian.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture they're not ethnically part of if they were raised in that culture. Like, if someone grows up in a household where they speak the language, practice traditions, etc., they might feel a cultural connection. But others might argue that ethnicity is tied to ancestry. So there's a debate here.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised as Italian. But the boyfriend's father isn't mentioned, so maybe he has no Italian blood. The boyfriend's identification as Italian is based on his upbringing, not genetics. The author is upset because they feel cultural appropriation is happening. But is that appropriation or just cultural appreciation?\n\nCultural appropriation is usually when someone from a dominant culture takes elements of a marginalized culture without permission or understanding. If the boyfriend is genuinely part of the Italian culture through upbringing, maybe it's more like cultural integration. However, if he's claiming Italian identity for superficial reasons without the cultural ties, it could be appropriation.\n\nThe author's issue is with the claim of being Italian when there's no blood relation. The boyfriend's argument is that being raised in that culture makes him Italian. It's a matter of how one defines cultural identity. Some cultures value heritage and bloodlines more than others. In Italy, for example, family and heritage are important, but in other contexts, cultural identity might be more fluid.\n\nThe author's reaction is about authenticity. They might feel that without the ancestral link, the boyfriend is misrepresenting himself. But others might say that culture isn't just about blood\u2014it's about how you live and identify. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, language, community) suggest he's immersed in Italian culture, so maybe he's justified in his self-identification.\n\nHowever, the line between appreciation and appropriation can be thin. If the boyfriend is doing it in a respectful way and has deep connections through upbringing, it's more appreciation. But if he's using it to fit into a certain image without the cultural ties, it could be seen as appropriation.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid concern about cultural authenticity. But the boyfriend's stance is also understandable if he feels culturally connected. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the boyfriend presents himself. If he's clear about his background and isn't denying his non-Italian origins, maybe it's not a big issue. But if he's pretending to have Italian roots, that's different.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't wrong for being upset, but the boyfriend's position also has merit. The main point is whether the boyfriend's identification is respectful and based on genuine cultural participation. Since the author is questioning the validity, it's a personal conflict where both sides have their points. The answer is likely B (the author isn't in the wrong) because the author's feelings are valid, but there's nuance.\n"
