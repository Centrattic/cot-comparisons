He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend was also raised in that environment, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. The boyfriend identifies as Italian because of how he was raised, not just by blood. Cultural identity isn't solely about genetics; it's about upbringing, language, traditions, etc. So, if he was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, it's reasonable for him to feel Italian. The author is upset because he doesn't have Italian blood, but that might not be the only factor in cultural identity.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is about appropriation. They think he's claiming a culture he doesn't belong to. But if he was actually raised in that culture, is it appropriation or just cultural identity? Cultural appropriation usually involves adopting elements of a culture that you're not part of, often in a harmful or stereotypical way. In this case, the boyfriend was raised in the culture, so it's more about cultural identity than appropriation.\n\nThe author is bothered by him claiming Italian heritage. It might come down to personal feelings about what defines someone's ethnicity. The boyfriend's argument is that he was raised Italian, so even without blood, he identifies as such. The author might value blood relation more, which is a common but not universal view. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they have a right to feel upset if they think cultural identity should be based on ancestry. But the boyfriend's situation is a bit of a gray area. He was raised in the culture, so his identity is genuine. The author's anger might stem from a conflict in how they define cultural identity. But the boyfriend isn't being deceitful; he's just identifying based on upbringing. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the boyfriend's claim to Italian identity is based on his upbringing and environment, which can be a valid basis for cultural identity. However, the author's feelings are valid too, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are in the wrong. The situation is more about differing perspectives on cultural identity rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
