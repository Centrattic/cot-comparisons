He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian without being born into the culture. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he was too. He speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and lives in an Italian neighborhood.\n\nThe author feels he's appropriating the culture because he doesn't have Italian blood. The key points here are about cultural identity and appropriation. The boyfriend was raised Italian, which might mean he identifies with the culture even if it's not his biological heritage. But the author is upset because he's claiming it as his own, which she sees as inauthentic.\n\nI need to consider cultural perspectives. Some people argue that culture is about upbringing and practice, not just blood. So if someone is immersed in a culture from childhood, they can claim that identity. Others might think that without ancestral ties, it's appropriation. The boyfriend's case is unique because his mother was deeply involved in the culture, so maybe it's more legitimate for him to identify as Italian through her influence.\n\nBut the author's main issue is that he's claiming the culture without being of Italian descent. However, if he was raised in that environment, some might say he's part of the culture in a different way. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry here. The boyfriend's actions don't seem to mock or stereotype, which is a positive. He's just expressing his upbringing.\n\nThe author's feeling of being wronged is valid because she might value ethnic heritage as part of identity. But culturally, especially in places where Italian identity is part of upbringing rather than blood, he might be seen as part of that culture. So the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend isn't necessarily wrong either. The answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because cultural identity can be complex, and her feelings are valid.\n"
