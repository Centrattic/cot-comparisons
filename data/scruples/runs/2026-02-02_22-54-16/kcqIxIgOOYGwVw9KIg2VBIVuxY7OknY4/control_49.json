He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian without having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised Italian, so the boyfriend grew up in that environment. He speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and is part of the Italian community. The author doesn't like that he \"appropriates\" the culture, even though he's not ethnically Italian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture not just through blood, but through upbringing and environment. The boyfriend's mom was raised Italian, so he grew up in that household. Does that make him culturally Italian? Maybe. Cultural appropriation usually involves exploiting aspects of a culture without understanding or respect, but here he's part of that culture through his upbringing. However, the author feels he's falsely claiming it, which could be a conflict in their relationship.\n\nThen there's the aspect of legitimacy. The author argues that you can't claim a culture just by cooking the food or speaking the language. But many people adopt cultural practices without being ethnically part of that group. The boyfriend is connecting to his mother's cultural upbringing. So is it wrong for him to identify that way? It might depend on how he presents it. If he's pretending to have heritage he doesn't, that's different from embracing a culture he was raised in.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is that he was \"raised Italian,\" which might be valid if his upbringing was deeply rooted in Italian culture. The author's issue is more about the lack of blood relation. But cultural identity isn't just about blood. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry here. Since the boyfriend's connection comes through his family's upbringing, maybe it's not appropriation but cultural inheritance through environment.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid. She might feel that cultural identity should be based on ancestry. This could lead to a bigger conversation about what defines cultural belonging. The boyfriend might not be wrong in claiming that identity, but the author's discomfort is real. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being upset. If he's not misrepresenting himself maliciously but the author feels it's inauthentic, it's more about their personal values clashing rather than a clear right or wrong. So the answer might hinge on whether the boyfriend's identification is respectful and rooted in his upbringing, which it seems it is. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but neither is the boyfriend. But the options are A (author wrong) or B (not). Since the boyfriend's actions aren't clearly wrong, the author's feelings are valid, so the answer might be B.\n"
