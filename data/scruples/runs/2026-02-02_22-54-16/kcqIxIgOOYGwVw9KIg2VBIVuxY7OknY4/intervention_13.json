He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but he himself isn't ethnically Italian. He says he's Italian because he was raised that way, speaks the language, cooks the food, etc.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether cultural identity can be claimed without ethnic blood. The author feels like he's appropriating the culture because there's no actual Italian blood. But the boyfriend argues that being raised in an Italian household makes him Italian. \n\nI think cultural identity is complex. Some people might argue that if you're immersed in the culture, language, food, etc., it's valid to identify with that culture even without ethnic ties. Others might see it as appropriation if there's no direct heritage. The line between appreciation and appropriation is blurry here.\n\nThe author is upset because he's claiming to be Italian when he's not ethnically. But the boyfriend's connection is through his mother's upbringing. Maybe the author feels that cultural identity shouldn't be claimed without ethnic roots. However, others might say that cultural practices and upbringing are enough for someone to identify with a culture. \n\nThe boyfriend's defense is that he was raised Italian, which is valid in some contexts. However, the author might feel that it's insincere or inauthentic. But is the author being too strict about bloodlines? There's also the aspect of how the boyfriend presents himself. If he's using it as part of his identity, maybe it's a personal choice. \n\nI don't think the author is in the wrong for feeling this way. People can have different views on cultural identity. The boyfriend might need to reflect on why he insists on claiming Italian heritage without blood ties. But the author isn't wrong for being upset about it. So the answer is B.\n"
