He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood, learned Italian in school, and his mom passed on the culture to him. He cooks Italian food, speaks some Italian, and identifies as Italian. But the person in the post is upset that he's not ethnically Italian and that he's appropriating the culture.\n\nHmm. The key points here are cultural identity versus ethnic background. The boyfriend is raised in an Italian culture, so he might feel a strong connection to it, even if his blood isn't Italian. On the other hand, the author feels that claiming an entire culture without any ethnic ties is inappropriate. \n\nCultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. Some might argue that if someone is immersed in a culture from a young age and identifies with it, they can be part of it. Others might say that without the heritage, it's appropriation. But in this case, the boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family, so he has some connection through her upbringing. Maybe the author is overstepping by being angry about his cultural identification?\n\nBut then again, if the boyfriend is explicitly claiming to be Italian (like on official documents or in conversations where ethnicity matters), that could be problematic. However, the post doesn't mention that. It seems like it's more about personal identification and social circles.\n\nThe author's issue is that he's not ethnically Italian but presents himself as such. They might feel that this is misleading, especially if it's important to them. On the other hand, cultural identity isn't solely about blood. If someone is raised in a certain culture, they can identify with it. So maybe the author is being too strict here.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's case is similar to someone being adopted into a different culture and identifying with it. That person can feel a part of that culture. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable, but maybe the boyfriend isn't wrong for identifying with the culture he was raised in. However, the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation is blurry here. Since the boyfriend has a deep connection through his mother's upbringing, maybe it's not appropriation. So the author's anger might be misplaced. \n\nBut the author's feelings are valid. If they care about authenticity in cultural claims, they might feel wronged. However, cultural identity can be complex. The answer might depend on the context of how the boyfriend uses his Italian identity. If he's using it for personal gain or in a way that's disrespectful, then the author has a point. But if it's just personal identification, maybe not. \n\nIn the end, the author is not in the wrong for feeling upset, but their reaction might not be entirely justified. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering that cultural identity isn't just about blood, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
