He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry that her boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's background: his mom was adopted by an Italian family, raised in an Italian household, bilingual, and they lived in a predominantly Italian area. The boyfriend was raised similarly by his mother. He doesn't act stereotypical, cooks Italian meals, and speaks the language a bit. He says he's Italian because he was raised that way, not by blood.\n\nThe author is upset because he's claiming a cultural identity without the blood. She feels it's appropriation. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. Cultural identity can be tied to upbringing, not just genetics. If someone is raised in a culture, they might feel connected to it. But the author thinks that just because someone speaks the language or cooks the food doesn't make them part of that culture. There's a line between cultural appreciation and appropriation here. \n\nBut the boyfriend's case is a bit different because his mother was deeply immersed in Italian culture, and he grew up in that environment. It's not like he's pretending; his upbringing was Italian. So maybe the author is being too strict. On the other hand, she might feel he's misrepresenting his heritage. \n\nHowever, cultural identity is often self-identified. If the boyfriend identifies as Italian because of his upbringing, does that matter? The author's issue is with the lack of blood relation, but blood isn't the only factor. Cultural practices and upbringing can form a cultural identity. \n\nThe boyfriend isn't acting in a stereotypical way, so maybe the issue is more about the author's sensitivity. She might feel that claiming heritage without genetic ties is appropriating. But others might argue that cultural identity isn't solely about genetics. \n\nSo, who's right? It depends on the perspective. The boyfriend's claim is based on upbringing and environment, which are valid for cultural identity in many cases. The author's concern is about authenticity and possible appropriation. However, since the boyfriend was raised in that culture, it's not entirely fake. Therefore, the author might be overreacting. But I need to consider if there's a clear right or wrong here. The answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong, because she's justified in feeling that cultural identity should have some biological ties. But others might say that cultural identity is self-determined. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the boyfriend is not pretending to be Italian for show but was actually raised in that culture. So maybe the author is wrong to be angry. Wait, but the author's perspective is that without blood, it's appropriation. The line between appreciation and appropriation is blurry. Since the boyfriend has deep ties to the culture through upbringing, maybe it's not appropriation. So perhaps the author is in the wrong (A). Hmm, conflicting thoughts. I need to decide based on cultural understanding. Generally, cultural identity can be claimed through upbringing and environment. Therefore, the author might be incorrect in her anger. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. Wait, but maybe not. The question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the boyfriend is genuinely raised in that culture, then he isn't wrong to identify as Italian. The author's anger is misplaced. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the boyfriend's claim is based on cultural identity, but the author feels it's appropriation, maybe she isn't wrong. It's a tough call. I think the key is that cultural identity can be self-identified, so the author is in the wrong for being angry. So answer A.\n"
