He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian despite not having Italian blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in an Italian household. The boyfriend grew up in that environment, learned Italian, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. He identifies as Italian but isn't of Italian descent. The author is upset about cultural appropriation because he's not ethnically Italian, even though he was raised in that culture.\n\nThe key points here are cultural identity versus ethnic heritage. The boyfriend's claim to being Italian is based on upbringing and environment, not blood. The author feels that this is fake because he doesn't have Italian blood, but others might argue that culture is more than just genetics. \n\nIn many cases, people identify with a culture they were raised in, even if not ethnically part of it. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still feel a strong connection. However, the author feels it's inauthentic because it's not tied to ancestry. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking Italian food, speaking the language, living in an Italian neighborhood\u2014show a deep cultural connection. But the author is focused on the lack of ethnic ties. \n\nI think the author's concern is valid if the boyfriend is using this identity to fit into a group he doesn't belong to by heritage. Cultural appropriation can be a sensitive issue, especially when it involves marginalized groups. However, the boyfriend's case is more about cultural assimilation rather than outright appropriation. \n\nBut then again, if he's being honest about his background and just identifies with the culture he was raised in, maybe it's not appropriation. The line here is blurry. The author might be overreacting, but their feelings are understandable. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether claiming a cultural identity without genetic ties is considered wrong. Some might say it's okay if it's a genuine part of one's upbringing. Others might see it as inauthentic. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but the boyfriend's intentions matter. If he's not mocking or exploiting the culture, then maybe the author is being too strict. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong for being upset, but the boyfriend's actions might not be entirely wrong either. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for being angry, the answer is B.\n"
