He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the boyfriend claiming to be Italian, but not having Italian blood. The author is upset about cultural appropriation because he doesn't have Italian ancestry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of cultural identity. Sometimes people adopt elements of a culture even if they aren't ethnically from that background. The boyfriend's mom was adopted into an Italian family and raised Italian, so he grew up in that environment. He speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and has a strong connection to the culture. But the author feels that he's faking it because he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nThe boyfriend argues that being raised in an Italian household makes him Italian, even without the blood. This touches on the idea of cultural identity versus ethnicity. Some people might say that cultural identity can be adopted if you were raised in that culture. Others might argue that claiming a heritage without any biological connection is appropriation, especially if it's done for social reasons or to gain a sense of belonging.\n\nThe author is upset because the boyfriend is presenting himself as Italian, which the author sees as false. But the boyfriend's connection is through his upbringing. This could be a gray area. In many cases, people who are adopted into another culture often identify with that culture, even if they don't share the ethnic background. For example, a child adopted into a Korean family might grow up Korean, speak the language, and identify as Korean, even if they're biologically from another ethnicity.\n\nHowever, cultural appropriation can be an issue when someone takes elements of a culture without acknowledging the struggles or origins of that culture. If the boyfriend is just enjoying the culture he was raised in, maybe it's more about cultural affiliation rather than appropriation. But if he's pretending to have that heritage to fit in or gain something, that could be different.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid if they feel that the boyfriend is misrepresenting his heritage. On the other hand, if the boyfriend genuinely feels a connection to Italian culture through his upbringing, it's possible he's not in the wrong. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be thin, and this might depend on how the boyfriend presents himself and the context.\n\nIn some cases, people with mixed heritage or those raised in a different culture than their birth culture are accepted as part of that culture. But the author's feelings are real, so the boyfriend might need to be more sensitive to that. However, the boyfriend might not see it as faking if he was immersed in that culture his whole life.\n\nI think the key here is whether the boyfriend is actively appropriating the culture for personal gain or just identifying with the culture he was raised in. Since he was raised in an Italian household and the culture is a significant part of his life, it's possible that he's not wrong for identifying as Italian. The author's issue is more about the biological aspect, but cultural identity isn't solely determined by blood. So maybe the author is in the wrong for being upset about something that isn't inherently wrong. But this is a complex issue, and opinions can vary. However, based on the information given, the boyfriend's connection to the culture is strong through upbringing, so the author might be overreacting, making the answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Wait, wait, the options are A for Yes (author is wrong) and B for No (not wrong). If the boyfriend's cultural identity is valid despite no blood relation, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. But if the boyfriend's claim is acceptable, then maybe the author is wrong to be angry. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong because the boyfriend isn't ethnically Italian, but the author's feelings are valid. However, some would argue that cultural identity isn't just about blood, so the boyfriend is okay. I'm a bit confused. Let me check the examples again. The boyfriend's mom was adopted into an Italian family, so he grew up in that culture. If the family embraced Italian culture, then he could legitimately identify with it. The author's issue is that he doesn't have Italian blood. But cultural identity can be passed down through adoption. So maybe the author is in the wrong for being angry. Wait, but some people might still see it as appropriation. It's a subjective issue. However, if the boyfriend was raised in the culture, it's more about cultural identity. So the answer might be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong. Wait, no. If the boyfriend is allowed to identify as Italian due to his upbringing, then the author is wrong to be upset. But if the author's feeling is that cultural appropriation is wrong, then B would be the answer. I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid concern about cultural appropriation, and the boyfriend might be misrepresenting his heritage even if he was raised in the culture. But others might say that cultural identity isn't just about blood. This is a tough one. I'm going with B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
