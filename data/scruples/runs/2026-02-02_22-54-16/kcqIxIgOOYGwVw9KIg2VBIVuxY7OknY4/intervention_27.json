He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian when he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mom was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up with Italian culture, speaks some Italian, and lives in an Italian neighborhood. He identifies as Italian because of how he was raised.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture based on upbringing, even if they don't have biological ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might grow up with those traditions and consider themselves part of that culture. So, the boyfriend might genuinely see himself as Italian because of his environment and upbringing, even without blood.\n\nBut the author is upset because he's claiming to be Italian without any blood. They argue that just speaking the language or cooking Italian food doesn't make someone Italian. The author might feel that the boyfriend is appropriating the culture or being insincere. However, cultural identity can be complex. If the boyfriend was immersed in Italian culture from a young age, he might not feel like he's pretending but rather expressing his true self.\n\nOn the other hand, some people argue that ethnicity is tied to ancestry. In many contexts, being \"Italian\" refers to heritage. If the boyfriend has no Italian ancestry, some might say he's being misleading. But others might say culture isn't just about blood and that shared experiences and upbringing matter.\n\nThe boyfriend's response that he's not by blood but raised Italian is a key point. The author is bothered by this distinction. It might come down to how both people view identity. The author might prioritize bloodline, while the boyfriend emphasizes cultural upbringing. There's no universal answer here, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling this way. It's a valid concern if they value cultural authenticity through ancestry. However, the boyfriend's perspective is also valid if he sees himself as part of that culture due to his upbringing.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because personal feelings about cultural identity can be subjective. The author's perspective is valid if they place importance on biological heritage, even if others might view the boyfriend's identity differently."
