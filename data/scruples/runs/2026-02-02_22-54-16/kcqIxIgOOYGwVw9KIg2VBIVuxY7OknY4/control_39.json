He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is upset with their boyfriend for claiming to be Italian, even though he doesn't have any Italian blood. His mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, but he himself isn't of Italian descent. The boyfriend grew up in an Italian environment, speaks Italian, cooks Italian food, and identifies as Italian.\n\nThe author feels that since he doesn't have Italian blood, he's appropriating the culture by claiming to be Italian. The boyfriend argues that even without blood, he was raised Italian. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for being angry about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of cultural identity. People can identify with a culture they were raised in, even if they don't have biological ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still identify with that culture. So the boyfriend's claim to being Italian based on his upbringing might be valid from his perspective.\n\nHowever, the author is upset about cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation is when someone adopts elements of another culture without understanding or respecting it, often in a way that's offensive or dismissive. In this case, the boyfriend seems to have been immersed in Italian culture from a young age, so it's more about cultural identity rather than appropriation. But the author's perspective is that without blood, he shouldn't claim to be Italian.\n\nI should also think about whether the boyfriend is misrepresenting himself. If he's being honest about his background (i.e., his mother's adoption and his upbringing), then he's not lying. The author's issue is with the identification itself, not with the facts. The boyfriend's statement \"I was raised Italian\" is a factual claim, even if he's not of Italian descent.\n\nAnother angle is the author's right to feel this way. It might be a difference in values. The author values blood heritage more, while the boyfriend values cultural upbringing. The question is whether the author's anger is justified. If the boyfriend is respectful and integrated into the culture, maybe the author's issue is more about personal preferences rather than something objectively wrong.\n\nBut then again, cultural identity can be complex. If the boyfriend is using the Italian identity to gain some form of validation or connection that he doesn't truly belong to, that could be appropriation. However, given that his mother was adopted into an Italian family and he grew up in that environment, it's more of an inherited cultural identity rather than something he's appropriating for trendy reasons.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for feeling upset, but it's a nuanced situation. The boyfriend's identification as Italian based on upbringing could be legitimate. The author's reaction might stem from their personal values about what constitutes cultural belonging. However, the boyfriend isn't lying; he's just identifying with the culture he was raised in. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way, but it's more of a difference in perspective rather than a clear case of wrongdoing.\n"
