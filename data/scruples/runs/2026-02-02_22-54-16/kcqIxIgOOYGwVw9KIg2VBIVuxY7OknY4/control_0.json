He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their boyfriend claims to be Italian despite not having Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family, so he grew up in an Italian household. The author feels like he's appropriating the culture.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture they were raised in, even if they don't have biological ties. For example, someone adopted into a different culture might still feel a strong connection. So, does that make it okay for the boyfriend to say he's Italian?\n\nThen there's the aspect of appropriation versus appreciation. The author is bothered because he's not of Italian descent but still claims to be. But if he was raised in that culture, does that count as appropriation? Maybe the line is blurry here. Cultural appreciation involves respecting and honoring a culture, whereas appropriation can be more about taking elements for fashion without understanding the significance.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions: cooking Italian food, speaking the language, being in an Italian neighborhood. These could be signs of a genuine connection through upbringing. However, the author argues that blood relation is necessary for claiming the culture. But cultural identity isn't always about biology. People can have strong cultural ties through upbringing, environment, and community.\n\nThe boyfriend's response: \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian.\" He's acknowledging the lack of blood relation but emphasizing the cultural upbringing. The author still feels he's inauthentic. Is it fair to expect someone to not claim a culture they were raised in, even without biological ties?\n\nSocietal norms vary. Some cultures are more inclusive, allowing people to identify based on upbringing. Others might stress lineage. The key here is intent. If the boyfriend is respectful and has grown up in that culture, maybe it's acceptable. But if he's exploiting it without understanding, that's a problem. The author's issue is about authenticity and appropriation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend genuinely identifies with Italian culture due to upbringing, then the author's anger might be misplaced. However, if there's no biological link, some might argue it's a form of cultural appropriation. But cultural identity is complex. The boyfriend's actions (cooking, language) show immersion, which could justify his claim.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's perspective is valid if they value biological ties for cultural identity. However, others might see the boyfriend's upbringing as sufficient. The answer hinges on societal views on cultural identity. Since the question is about being in the wrong, if the boyfriend's actions are respectful and rooted in his upbringing, the author might be overreacting. But if the boyfriend is being deceptive or exploiting the culture, then the author has a point. The situation is nuanced, but based on the given info, the boyfriend's upbringing and environment support his cultural identity claim, so the author might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
