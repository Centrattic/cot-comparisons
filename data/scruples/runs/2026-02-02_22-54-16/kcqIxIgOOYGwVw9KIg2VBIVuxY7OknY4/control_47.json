He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is wrong for being upset about their boyfriend's claim to Italian heritage. So the boyfriend's mom was adopted into an Italian family and raised as Italian, and the boyfriend grew up in that environment too. He's got all the Italian cultural stuff down\u2014cooking, language, friends, neighborhood, even school. But the author feels like he's appropriating the culture since he doesn't have Italian blood.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider cultural identity. Like, can someone be part of a culture without being ethnically from that background? I think in many cases people can adopt a culture, especially if they were raised in that environment. For example, adopted kids often take on the culture of their adoptive families. So the boyfriend's mom was raised Italian, and he was too. So maybe he sees himself as Italian because that's how he was raised. But the author is upset because he doesn't have \"a drop of blood\" in him. Is blood really that important here?\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels like he's claiming a culture he doesn't belong to. But if his entire upbringing was Italian, maybe he's culturally Italian. It's a bit of a gray area. The boyfriend says he's not by blood but raised Italian. So he's acknowledging the ethnic aspect but still embracing the cultural part. Maybe the author is being hypocritical if they themselves have a mixed background or something. Wait, the question doesn't mention the author's background, so maybe not.\n\nThere's also the aspect of appropriation versus appreciation. If he's just enjoying the culture he was part of growing up, it's more appreciation. But if he's using it as a label without any real connection, maybe that's appropriation. But given the details, he was immersed in it. The author's issue is more about authenticity through blood, which some people prioritize, but others don't. So the question is, is the author wrong for being upset?\n\nI think the answer depends on how strict one is about cultural identity. If the boyfriend was raised with the culture, he might feel it's part of his identity. The author might be right to feel that his claiming is a bit disingenuous if he doesn't have the ethnic ties. But others might argue that cultural belonging isn't just about blood. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance here. The options are A or B. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's reasoning is valid, then answer B (not in the wrong). If not, A. Given that the boyfriend was raised in the culture, but the author is upset about the lack of blood, maybe the author is being too strict. But maybe not. It's a tough call. I think the author isn't wrong because cultural identity can be complex, and the boyfriend's claim might be seen as appropriation despite upbringing. Or maybe not. Hmm. The answer could swing either way. I'm leaning towards B because the author isn't in the wrong if they feel the boyfriend is misrepresenting himself, even if he was raised that way. But some might say it's okay to identify culturally. I need to decide. Let me check similar cases. In other AITA scenarios, people are often allowed to identify with a culture they were raised in, even if not ethnically tied. So maybe the author is wrong to be upset. But the author's point is that you can't be Italian without blood. If the boyfriend's mom was adopted and raised Italian, and he was too, then maybe he's culturally Italian. The author's issue is about authenticity through blood. If that's the case, maybe the author is being too rigid. So answer A, the author is in the wrong? Or B? Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author's right to be upset, then answer B. If not, A. I think the author isn't in the wrong because cultural identity can be a sensitive topic. Even if he was raised Italian, the lack of ethnic ties might feel like appropriation to some. So answer B.\n"
