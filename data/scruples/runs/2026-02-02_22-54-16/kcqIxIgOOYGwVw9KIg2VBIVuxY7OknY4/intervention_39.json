He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that her boyfriend claims to be Italian without being ethnically Italian. The boyfriend's mother was adopted by an Italian family and raised in an Italian household, so he grew up in an Italian environment. The author feels that just because he was raised that way doesn't make him ethnically Italian, and she's upset about cultural appropriation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people define ethnicity by ancestry, while others see it as part of cultural upbringing. The boyfriend's case is a bit of a gray area. His mother was raised Italian, but he's not ethnically Italian. The question is whether he's allowed to identify as Italian because of his upbringing or if that's appropriation.\n\nCultural appropriation is a sensitive topic. It usually involves a dominant group adopting elements from a marginalized culture without understanding or respecting the culture's significance. In this case, the boyfriend grew up in an Italian household, learned the language and traditions, so it's more integrated into his life. But since he has no ethnic ties, some might see it as appropriative, especially if he presents himself as ethnically Italian.\n\nHowever, others might argue that cultural identity isn't solely about blood. If someone is raised in a culture and identifies with it, they can be part of that culture. Countries like Italy have people who are ethnically Italian but were raised differently, and vice versa. So, there's a debate here between ethnic heritage and cultural upbringing.\n\nThe author's issue is about authenticity. She believes that ethnic heritage is necessary to claim a cultural identity. The boyfriend's defense is that he was raised in that culture, which is a valid point. But does that justify him claiming to be Italian? It depends on societal norms and the couple's personal values.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't wrong for feeling that way if she values ethnic heritage. On the other hand, the boyfriend isn't wrong if he identifies with the culture he was raised in. The key is whether the boyfriend is being deceptive. If he's clearly stating his background but still insists on identifying as Italian, maybe the author's discomfort is valid. But if he's honest about his heritage and still chooses to embrace the culture, it's more about personal identity.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on the definition of Italian identity. If the author prioritizes ethnicity, she's justified. If others prioritize cultural upbringing, the boyfriend is okay. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering cultural identity can be complex, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for her feelings.\n"
