He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.\n\nHis mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised \"the Italian way\", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. \n\nAs things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.\n\nBut it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like \"I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian\". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.\n\nJust because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry that their boyfriend claims to be Italian even though he doesn't have Italian blood. The boyfriend's mother was adopted into an Italian family and raised in that culture, but the boyfriend himself isn't ethnically Italian.\n\nHmm. So the boyfriend grew up in an Italian household, speaks the language, cooks Italian food, and is part of an Italian community. The author feels like he's appropriating the culture without actually being part of it. The boyfriend argues that being raised Italian is enough.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural identity. Some people identify with a culture even if they don't have direct ethnic ties. Like, if someone is raised in a culture, they might feel connected to it. But then, others might see that as cultural appropriation, especially if they're not part of the ethnic group. The line between cultural appreciation and appropriation can be blurry.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother is adopted into an Italian family, so maybe he has a connection through her. But the user is upset because he claims to be Italian without any blood relation. The boyfriend's defense is that he was raised that way. But the author thinks that's not enough. \n\nCultural identity can be complex. Some people might argue that cultural identity isn't just about blood but about upbringing and community. But others might say that claiming a culture without any ethnic ties is misleading. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's actions\u2014cooking, speaking, participating in the culture\u2014could be seen as genuine appreciation. However, if the author feels like it's appropriation, that's a personal issue they have. The author's discomfort might stem from authenticity concerns. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The boyfriend might believe he's honoring his mother's culture, while the author sees it as inauthentic. The author isn't wrong for feeling this way, but maybe they should discuss it more with their boyfriend to understand each other's perspectives. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the author's feelings are valid regarding cultural authenticity. The boyfriend's claim could be seen as genuine to him, but the author's perspective is also legitimate. It's more about differing views on cultural identity rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
