Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband with multiple affairs, and they're in therapy. The therapist set some guidelines: husband should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He agreed. Then, when he went out with friends, he wanted to stay out past 10, even though the agreement was to be home by then. The wife stood her ground, got into a fight, and he came home late, then complained about it. The question is whether the wife is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, which is a major issue. The therapist's advice was to set boundaries to rebuild trust. The wife followed the therapist's guidelines, which the husband initially agreed to. When he tried to break the agreement, she called him out on it. He not only broke the agreement but also tried to justify it, leading to a fight. \n\nThe user is asking if the wife is wrong. The key points here are: the husband agreed to the rules, he violated them, and the wife enforced them. In such cases, especially after infidelity, rebuilding trust requires strict adherence to agreed-upon boundaries. The wife's actions seem reasonable as she's trying to maintain the trust-building process. The husband is the one who didn't follow through. The fact that he's using \"Jim\" to make her feel guilty adds to his fault. The wife's anger is justified given his history and his current behavior.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The wife is acting within her rights to enforce the agreed-upon rules set by the therapist, especially after his infidelity. The husband is the one who's not respecting the boundaries he committed to.\n"
