Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wife dealing with her husband's affairs and setting boundaries through therapy. The husband agreed to certain guidelines, like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. But he breaks that by staying out late with a friend named Jim, even though he said he wouldn't drink with women.\n\nFirst, the therapist's role is important here. They came up with these guidelines together, so the husband agreed to them. The wife is enforcing the agreement, which is reasonable. When he texts to stay out later, she's firm about the agreement. He argues, and they fight. Then he comes home late and dismisses her concerns, even implying that Jim is mad at her now. \n\nThe key points are: the husband violated the agreed-upon rules, the wife stood her ground, and he's resistant to following through. The wife's anger is about him breaking his word and trying to guilt-trip her with Jim. The user thinks she's not wrong, and I agree. He agreed to the rules and then broke them, making her trust harder to rebuild. His resistance and the guilt-trip tactics are problematic. So, answer B.\n"
