Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a husband with a history of affairs, and they've set some boundaries with their therapist. The key points here are the agreement made in therapy, the husband breaking the agreed-upon rules, and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the couple had a specific plan: the husband agreed to be home by 10 PM and avoid drinking with women. This was part of a structured approach to rebuild trust after multiple infidelities. The husband then goes out with friends, promises to be home on time, but calls to stay out with just one friend, Jim. The author reminds him of the agreement, leading to a big fight. The husband argues the rule isn't necessary and decides to stop following it.\n\nThe author's actions are based on the agreed-upon guidelines. She's holding him accountable, which is a reasonable expectation given his past behavior. The therapist's recommendation was that he needs to be held accountable. The husband's behavior here\u2014breaking a specific rule and then justifying it with excuses\u2014undermines the trust and the therapeutic process. \n\nThe author's anger is justified because the husband is going back on his word, which is crucial for rebuilding trust. Using \"Jim\" as an excuse and dismissing the agreed time as unnecessary shows a lack of commitment to the agreed-upon steps. The author isn't being unreasonable here; she's enforcing the boundaries set by both the therapist and the husband himself. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's standing by the boundaries necessary for the marriage to recover. The husband's actions and his refusal to adhere to the agreed terms are the primary issues here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
