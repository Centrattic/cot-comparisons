Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist to rebuild trust. The key part is that the husband agreed to be home by 10 PM, but he stayed out past that time with a friend named Jim, even though he told the author he wouldn't drink with women. He then argued about the time and tried to use Jim as an excuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, so trust is a big issue here. The therapist suggested setting boundaries, and the husband agreed to these. Breaking that agreement could be a valid reason for the author to be upset. The husband not only broke the agreed-upon time but also made excuses and tried to shift blame. The author stood her ground, which makes sense given the circumstances.\n\nThe husband's actions seem to undermine the trust-building process. He's supposed to be held accountable, and by breaking the agreement, he's not following through on his commitments. The author's reaction\u2014expressing her need for him to follow through and even threatening to leave if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage\u2014is a reasonable response to his repeated infidelity and current non-compliance.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband felt the curfew was too strict. But he agreed to it initially, so changing his mind mid-agreement without discussion might not be fair. The fact that he tried to use Jim as a guilt-trip suggests he's not taking responsibility. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's enforcing what they both agreed on with a therapist. So, it seems like the husband is the one in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
