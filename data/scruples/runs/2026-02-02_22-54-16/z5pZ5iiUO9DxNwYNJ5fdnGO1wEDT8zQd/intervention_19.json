Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who agreed to certain boundaries with his wife after having affairs, but then didn't follow through. The wife is upset and the husband is making excuses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple had a therapist and set up guidelines: husband must be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He agreed to these. Then he goes out, texts her that he wants to stay out because he's with \"Jim,\" and ends up coming home 45 minutes late. He argues it's just one guy and that the rules aren't fair. He also mentions that \"Jim\" is mad at the wife. The wife is upset because he broke his word and used Jim as an excuse.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The user thinks she's not, but wants confirmation. So I need to evaluate from both sides. \n\nOn the wife's side, she's trying to rebuild trust after affairs. The therapist's guidelines were agreed upon, so she's following the plan. She's concerned about his behavior and is holding him accountable. When he breaks the agreement, she's justified in feeling angry because trust is crucial here. His excuses (just one guy, Jim being mad) don't seem valid, especially since he had agreed to the rules. \n\nOn the husband's side, maybe he feels the rules are too strict. He might think that socializing with friends is important, but he agreed to them. His actions of breaking the agreement and making excuses could be seen as not taking the process seriously. Also, using \"Jim\" as a reason to stay out and then blaming the wife for making Jim mad could be manipulative or dismissive of her feelings.\n\nTrust issues from past affairs mean that the wife's need for accountability is valid. The husband not following through undermines their therapeutic process. The wife's anger is a response to his breaking his word, which is a legitimate concern. So it seems like the author isn't in the wrong here. The husband is not holding up his end of the agreement, and she's justified in being upset. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she's being too rigid? But given the context of infidelity, strict rules are necessary. She's following the therapist's advice. Also, he agreed to the rules initially, so she's not being unreasonable. His failure to comply is his responsibility. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
