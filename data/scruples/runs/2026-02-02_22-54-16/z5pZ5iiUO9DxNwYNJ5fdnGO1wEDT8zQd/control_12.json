Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an ongoing issue with the husband's infidelity, and they've set up some guidelines in therapy. The husband agreed to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He broke that agreement by staying out past 10, and then made excuses about it. The author is frustrated and angry because he's not following the rules they agreed on.\n\nSo, the main points here are that they were working with a therapist to rebuild trust after multiple affairs. The husband agreed to specific terms, then violated them. The wife called him out, which led to a fight. She even threatened to leave if he wasn't committed to fixing the marriage. The husband is now defensive, saying the rule isn't doable and that he's within his rights to stay out.\n\nI need to determine if the wife is wrong in her reaction. The key factors are: the agreed-upon rules from therapy, the husband's violation of those rules, and the wife's response. \n\nThe wife is enforcing boundaries that were established in therapy to rebuild trust. The husband's actions are undermining that effort by not adhering to the agreed terms. His excuses (like \"it's just one guy\") don't justify breaking the rules. The wife's anger and insistence on accountability seem reasonable given the history of affairs. She's trying to hold him accountable, which is necessary for trust rebuilding. The husband's response is dismissive and even attempts to shift blame (Jim being mad at her) which is manipulative.\n\nIn relationships, accountability is crucial, especially after infidelity. The wife's stance is about maintaining the agreed structure to rebuild trust. The husband's refusal to comply with the set rules and his defensiveness suggest he's not fully committed to the process. Therefore, the wife is justified in her anger and the steps she took to enforce the boundaries. \n\nThe answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's enforcing the terms they agreed on for trust rebuilding, and the husband's actions violate those terms. Her response is appropriate given the circumstances.\n"
