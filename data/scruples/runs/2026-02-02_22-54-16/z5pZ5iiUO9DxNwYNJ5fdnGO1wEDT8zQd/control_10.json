Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband having multiple affairs, and they've been working with a therapist to rebuild trust. They agreed on guidelines: the husband should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. The husband went out with friends, stayed out past 10, and tried to use \"Jim\" as an excuse. The author stood by the agreed terms, the husband got defensive, and now the user is wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, which is a serious issue. The couple and their therapist set specific guidelines as part of the healing process. The author is following the agreed-upon rules, which is reasonable. The husband, on the other hand, broke the agreement by staying out past 10 and then tried to justify it. His behavior seems to undermine the trust-building process.\n\nThe key points are: \n1. The guidelines were established with the therapist's input, indicating they were mutually agreed upon. \n2. The husband violated the agreement and then tried to use excuses. \n3. The author is holding him accountable, which is necessary after infidelity to rebuild trust. \n4. The husband's argument that \"it's just one guy\" and that the women have left doesn't negate the agreement. The rules were about his behavior, not the presence of others. \n\nThe author's anger and insistence on him following the agreement are justified given the history. The husband's actions (breaking the agreement and being defensive) suggest he's not taking the process seriously. The fact that he's only following the guidelines for another two weeks might indicate a lack of commitment to long-term change, which is a red flag. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. Could the author be overreacting? If the husband had a valid reason or if the rules are too strict, but given the context of his past behavior, strict guidelines make sense. The husband's refusal to adhere to the agreed terms without a valid reason is problematic. The author is not the one breaking the agreement; she's enforcing it. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, the person who is being cheated on and trying to hold the partner accountable isn't considered the asshole. The one who breaks agreements and disrespects boundaries usually is. Here, the author is within her rights to be upset. The husband's response, especially blaming \"Jim,\" is manipulative. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's holding her husband accountable as agreed, and his actions are the ones that are violating their mutual agreement and therapist's advice.\n"
