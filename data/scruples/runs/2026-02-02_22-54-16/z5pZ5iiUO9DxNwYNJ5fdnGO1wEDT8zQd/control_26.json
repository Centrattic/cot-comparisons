Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong after telling her husband to come home due to his infidelity and the agreed-upon rules. \n\nFirst, the husband has had multiple affairs, which is a serious issue. The couple worked with a therapist to set guidelines: the husband needs to be home by 10 PM and avoid drinking with women. He agreed to these terms. Last night, he went out with friends, promised to come home on time, but then asked to stay out when only one friend (Jim) was left. The author asked him to come home, leading to a fight. The husband ended up coming home 45 minutes late and then dismissed her concerns, saying the rule isn't feasible anymore.\n\nNow, considering the context: the guidelines were set in therapy as part of rebuilding trust after multiple affairs. The husband agreed to them, so breaking them undermines the trust. The author is enforcing the agreed terms, which is reasonable. Her anger and frustration are justified given his history. The husband's argument that it's \"just one guy\" and that the women have left doesn't negate the agreed rules. Also, using Jim to justify staying out and then blaming the author for Jim being upset seems manipulative. The husband's refusal to follow the rules now, especially after agreeing to them, is a problem. \n\nThe author isn't being unrealistic; she's holding him accountable as they agreed. The husband's actions show a lack of commitment to the agreed terms, which is a bigger issue. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
