Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who's had multiple affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist. The main issue is that the husband didn't come home by 10 PM as agreed, but instead stayed out with a friend named Jim. The wife made him come home, and now he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is in therapy, and the husband agreed to the rules to rebuild trust. The wife is enforcing the agreed-upon boundaries, which is a reasonable step in such situations. The husband, however, is breaking the agreement and trying to justify it by saying it's just one instance and that Jim is now mad at the wife. \n\nThe key points here are the agreed rules and the importance of following them to rebuild trust. When someone has broken trust through affairs, strict adherence to boundaries is crucial. The wife is holding him accountable, which is necessary for healing. The husband's argument that \"it's just one guy\" undermines the seriousness of the agreement and shows a lack of commitment to the process.\n\nAlso, the husband's response after coming home late\u2014saying he was home before 11 and that the wife is making Jim angry\u2014seems like he's deflecting responsibility. He's not taking the wife's feelings into account and is trying to shift blame. This behavior is not helping the relationship and might be damaging the trust further.\n\nThe wife's anger is understandable. She's trying to rebuild trust, and breaking the agreed rules can set back progress. The therapist's role was to set these guidelines, so the wife is following professional advice. The husband's refusal to stick to the rules and his whining suggest he's not taking the necessary steps to fix the marriage, which is a valid concern for the wife.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the husband is being a bit harsh, but given his history of affairs, strict boundaries are essential. The wife's stance is about maintaining the agreed structure, which is crucial for her sense of security and the marriage's recovery.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. She's enforcing the rules they set together with their therapist to rebuild trust. The husband's actions and attitude are the main issues here.\n"
