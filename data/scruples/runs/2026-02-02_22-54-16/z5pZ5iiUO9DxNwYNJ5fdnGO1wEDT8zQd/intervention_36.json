Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home on time after he broke their agreed-upon rules.\n\nFirst, the context: the husband has a history of affairs, and they're in therapy. They set guidelines with their therapist, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. Then, he breaks the rule by staying out past 10, using the excuse that he's with a friend named Jim and that the women have left. He argues about the time and later claims he was home before 11, which is still late. The author is upset because he broke his word and tried to guilt-trip her with Jim's feelings.\n\nSo, the main points here are about trust, accountability, and agreed boundaries. The author is trying to rebuild trust after infidelity, which is a big deal. The husband agreed to specific terms as part of therapy, so breaking them undermines that process. His behavior\u2014arguing, whining, and then dismissing the rule after 45 minutes of being late\u2014doesn't show accountability. The author's anger is justified because he violated their agreement, which was meant to help rebuild trust. The therapist's advice was about accountability, and the husband isn't following through. \n\nIs the author being unrealistic? The rules were set by their therapist, so they're part of a professional plan. The husband's excuses (just one guy, all the women left) don't negate the agreed terms. The author's stance that he should adhere to the rules is reasonable. The husband's response of not following the rules anymore after two weeks suggests he's not committed to the process, which is a problem. \n\nThe author's anger stems from broken trust and a lack of accountability from the husband. She's setting boundaries to protect the marriage, which is valid. The husband's actions don't align with the therapeutic goals they set together. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong; she's holding him accountable as advised by their therapist. The husband's behavior is the issue here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
