Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband with multiple affairs who agreed to certain rules for rebuilding trust. The author told him to come home by 10, but he stayed out later with a friend named Jim, arguing it's just one guy and that he shouldn't have to follow the rule. They fought, and he later said the time isn't doable and he won't follow it anymore. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting him to adhere to the agreed-upon rules.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple was advised by a therapist to set guidelines for the husband to rebuild trust after his infidelity. The agreement was part of a structured plan. The husband agreed to these terms, so the author's expectation is based on a prior agreement made in therapy. Breaking that agreement could be seen as a breach of trust, especially given the history of affairs.\n\nThe husband's actions: he went out with friends, initially agreed to come home by 10, then changed his mind when only one guy was left. He used Jim as an excuse and then later dismissed the importance of the rule. This behavior might be undermining the trust-building process. The author's anger is understandable because the husband isn't following through on his commitments, which is crucial when rebuilding trust.\n\nThe husband's response that he was home before 11 and that Jim is mad at her might be attempts to deflect responsibility. The author isn't being unrealistic; setting clear boundaries is standard in such recovery processes. The therapist's advice supports the author's approach. The husband's refusal to follow the guidelines could indicate a lack of commitment to fixing the marriage, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance about communication. Did the author and husband discuss the rules thoroughly? The husband might feel the rules are too restrictive, but he agreed to them. If he can't commit, that's his issue. The author's reaction is about enforcing the agreed-upon terms, which is not unreasonable. The key point is that the husband went back on his word, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She's upholding a commitment made in therapy to rebuild trust. The husband's non-compliance is the problem here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
