Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who's had multiple affairs, and they've set boundaries with their therapist. The key points are that the husband agreed to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He went out with friends, asked to stay out past 10, and then argued about the rules. The author told him to come home, leading to a fight. The husband then claims he was home by 11 and that the author made his friend \"Jim\" angry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The husband had agreed to specific guidelines during therapy, so breaking those terms could be seen as a problem. The author is trying to hold him accountable, which is reasonable when rebuilding trust after infidelity. The husband's argument that one instance isn't a big deal might undermine the effort to rebuild trust. The author's anger stems from the breach of agreement and the husband's lack of cooperation, which is valid in the context of their situation.\n\nThe husband's response\u2014saying he was home before 11 and that \"Jim\" is mad\u2014seems like shifting blame. The author's insistence on him following the agreed-upon rules isn't being unreasonable; it's part of the therapeutic process. The key here is whether the author overstepped by being firm. Since the husband agreed to the terms, the author's expectation is within reason. The husband's refusal to adhere and the argument over a 45-minute delay might indicate his unwillingness to commit to the necessary changes, which is a bigger issue.\n\nSo, considering the context of rebuilding trust after infidelity and the agreed-upon boundaries, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are about maintaining the agreed rules, which are crucial in such situations. The husband's behavior suggests a lack of commitment to the agreed terms, which is a red flag. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
