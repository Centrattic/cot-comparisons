Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a husband who agreed to certain guidelines with his therapist and wife to rebuild trust after multiple affairs. The guidelines include being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the agreement by staying out past 10 with a guy named Jim, even though he had previously agreed to the rules. The wife confronts him, they fight, and the husband doubles down, saying the rules aren't doable and that the time isn't important anymore.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if that's accurate. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband agreed to the guidelines with the therapist and his wife. Breaking those agreements could be seen as a failure to follow through on commitments, which is a problem in rebuilding trust. The wife is trying to enforce the agreed-upon terms, which is a reasonable expectation after infidelity. The husband's argument that it's just one guy and that he can stay out later undermines the trust-building process. His behavior of trying to justify the breach by blaming the situation and another person (Jim) might be manipulative.\n\nThe wife's response is to express her need for trust and to hold him accountable, which is valid given the history of affairs. She's not being unrealistic; she's setting boundaries that the husband had agreed to. The husband's resistance and the fact that he's only following the rules for a short time left (2 weeks) might indicate a lack of commitment to the agreed terms. \n\nConsidering these points, the wife is justified in her anger and in holding him to the agreement. The husband's actions and arguments seem to be in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer would be B (no, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
