Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who has had multiple affairs and is in therapy. They set boundaries with their therapist, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks this agreement by staying out past 10 when he's with a guy named Jim, and then argues with the author. The author got angry and said if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, she'll go back home. The husband later came home but was 45 minutes late and is now upset at the author.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The husband has a history of infidelity, which is a significant breach of trust. The couple's therapist set up guidelines for him to follow to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to these terms. His actions of breaking the agreement, even if it's with a guy, challenge the trust. The author's response was to enforce the agreed-upon rules and express her frustration, which is understandable given the context. \n\nHe argues that it's just one guy and that the women are gone, but he was supposed to not drink with women regardless. However, in this case, he's with a man, so maybe he's trying to say that the rule doesn't apply here. But the rule was about not drinking with women, not about being with men. However, the main agreement was being home by 10, which he broke. The fact that he's using \"Jim\" to justify staying out might be an excuse to not follow the rule. The author's anger stems from him breaking his word, which is crucial for rebuilding trust after infidelity.\n\nThe husband's response after coming home late, being dismissive and making the author feel guilty, could indicate he's not taking her feelings seriously. The author's firm stance is a response to his lack of accountability. In such situations, the person who's been betrayed often needs strict boundaries to feel safe. The author isn't being unrealistic; she's holding him to the commitments he made, especially in therapy. The husband's resistance to following the guidelines suggests he's not fully committed to rebuilding the relationship, which is a problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's enforcing the necessary boundaries set in therapy. The husband is the one violating agreements and dismissing her concerns. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
