Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for telling her husband to come home as per their agreement. The husband has a history of affairs, and they set up guidelines with a therapist. The specific rule was he needs to be home by 10 PM. He went out with friends, stayed past 10, tried to get an exception by saying it was just him and \"Jim,\" then got defensive when she asked him to come home.\n\nFirst, the therapist's guidelines are part of a trust-building process. The husband agreed to these rules, so breaking them would be a problem. The author is enforcing the agreement, which seems reasonable. She's trying to rebuild trust after multiple affairs, so consistency is key. \n\nHe argues that it's just one guy and that the women (who he shouldn't drink with) have left. But the rule isn't about drinking with women but being home by 10. His behavior breaks the agreed-upon boundary, which is crucial for trust. \n\nHe also blames the other person, \"Jim,\" implying her strictness is causing issues between him and his friend. That's a classic deflection tactic. The author is justified in feeling upset because he's violating their agreed terms and not taking her trust issues seriously. \n\nHe later says the rule isn't doable, but there's no mention of prior issues or trying to adjust the rule. They had two weeks left, so maybe the time frame is part of the process. The author's stance is about accountability, which the therapist recommended. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong. She's upholding the boundaries necessary for their marriage to recover. His actions and attitude suggest he's not committed to the agreed steps, which is his issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
