Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home on time after he agreed to guidelines set during therapy.\n\nFirst, the husband has a history of affairs, so trust is a big issue. Therapy recommended specific rules, like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. He agreed to these. Then he breaks them by staying out late with a guy named Jim. He argues that it's just one instance and that Jim is now mad at the author. \n\nThe author stood her ground, emphasizing the importance of trust rebuilding. She's frustrated because he's not following through on his commitment. The husband's actions seem to undermine the therapy's plan. His breaking the rule and trying to shift blame to Jim might be a way to avoid accountability.\n\nThe key points are: agreed upon terms, breach of trust, and the husband's defensiveness. The author is trying to rebuild trust, which requires consistency. The husband's refusal to adhere to the agreed guidelines and his deflection suggest he's not taking the situation seriously. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for holding him accountable. The answer is B.\n"
