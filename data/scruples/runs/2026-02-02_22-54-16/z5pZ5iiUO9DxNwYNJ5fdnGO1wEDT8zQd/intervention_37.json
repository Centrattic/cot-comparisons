Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home on time after he agreed to guidelines set by their therapist. The husband had multiple affairs, so trust is a big issue here.\n\nThe therapist's advice was to set boundaries like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband agreed, but then went out with friends and tried to stay out past 10. He even used an excuse about being with \"Jim\" and not wanting to follow the rule. The author stood her ground, which makes sense because breaking the agreed terms could undermine the rebuilding of trust.\n\nThe husband's behavior here seems to be a test of the boundaries. By not following through, he's not taking the rules seriously, and that's a problem. The author's anger is justified because he broke the agreement and tried to guilt-trip her with \"Jim.\" She's not being unreasonable; setting clear expectations is necessary after infidelity. The key points are the therapist's guidelines, the husband's noncompliance, and the author's response to protect the trust-building process. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
