Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insisting her husband come home by 10 PM as agreed, after he had affairs. The key points are the agreed guidelines from therapy, his breaking the agreement, and the conflict that followed.\n\nFirst, the husband has a history of affairs, and they set up rules with a therapist. The rule here is being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. He agreed to this, but then texts to stay out later. The author reminds him of the agreement, leading to an argument. He later breaks the curfew again and dismisses the rule.\n\nThe author's actions seem justified because they were part of a structured plan to rebuild trust. He's not following through on his commitments, which is a problem. The therapist's role here indicates that these guidelines are part of a necessary process. The husband's argument about \"Jim\" and trying to shift blame seems manipulative. The author is standing by the agreement they made, which is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering the context of rebuilding trust after infidelity and the need for accountability, the author is not in the wrong. Her demand for adherence to agreed boundaries is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
