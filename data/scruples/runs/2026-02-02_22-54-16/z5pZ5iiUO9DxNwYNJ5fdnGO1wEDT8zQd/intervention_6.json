Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is that the husband has had multiple affairs, and they were working with a therapist to rebuild trust. They set some guidelines: he should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He agreed, but then broke the rule by staying out past 10 with a guy named Jim. The author asked him to come home, they fought, and he ended up coming home 45 minutes late. Now he's upset and says the rule isn't doable anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple is in therapy for infidelity. The husband agreed to specific terms as part of rebuilding trust. Breaking those terms could be a big deal because trust is already compromised. The author was firm about the agreed-upon rules, which makes sense in the context of rebuilding trust. The husband's argument that it's just one guy and that the women have left might be an excuse to justify breaking the rule. Also, he's trying to guilt-trip her by saying Jim is mad at her. \n\nThe author's response, telling him that not following the agreement makes her consider ending the marriage, seems like a justified reaction given the history of affairs. The husband's refusal to adhere to the agreed terms, even after being reminded by the therapist, suggests he's not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a perspective of accountability and trust-building, the author is in the right for holding the husband to the agreement. The husband's actions undermine the process, and the author's anger is a valid response. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
