Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home as agreed. The situation involves a husband with a history of affairs, and they had set up guidelines with their therapist, including being home by 10 PM. The husband went out with friends, wanted to stay out past 10, and the author insisted he come home on time. They had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The therapist's role here is important. They set the guidelines, so the husband agreed to them. The author is following through to rebuild trust, which is a key part of their therapy plan. The husband broke the agreed-upon rule, then tried to justify it by saying he was home before 11 and that he doesn't need to follow the rules anymore. That seems like he's not taking the agreement seriously, which could hinder trust rebuilding.\n\nThe author is standing by the rules they both agreed on. She's not being unreasonable; she's trying to enforce the boundaries necessary for their therapy. The husband's argument that \"it's just one guy\" and that he's not drinking with women anymore might not excuse him breaking the agreed-upon time. The fact that he's only following the rules until they expire in two weeks suggests he's not committed, which could be a bigger issue.\n\nThe author's anger is justified because he broke his word, which is critical in a situation where trust has been broken. His response about being home before 11 is a technicality; the agreement was 10 PM. She's right to hold him accountable. Also, using \"Jim\" to make her feel guilty is a manipulative tactic, which shows poor communication and lack of respect.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to rebuild trust as advised by the therapist. The husband is the one who broke the agreement and is not taking the process seriously. The answer should be B (No).\n"
