Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a husband who's had multiple affairs and agreed to some guidelines with his wife and therapist. The key points here are the agreed-upon rules, the husband's actions, and the wife's response.\n\nFirst, the husband agreed to be home by 10 PM and not to drink with women. He went out with his friends and was going to stay late with one guy, Jim. The wife asked him to come home, citing the agreement, but he argued and ended up coming home late. Now he's upset and says the 10 PM rule isn't doable anymore.\n\nFrom the wife's perspective, she's trying to rebuild trust after infidelity. The therapist's advice was to set clear guidelines, and the husband initially agreed. Breaking that agreement, even for a small breach, can be really hurtful. She's acting on the boundaries they set together. The husband not only broke the agreed rule but also used another person (Jim) to justify his actions, which could be seen as manipulative or trying to make her feel guilty. That doesn't seem fair.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband felt the 10 PM curfew was too strict, but if he agreed to it, then changing his mind after the fact might not be reasonable. The wife's anger is justified because he violated the trust and the agreement they worked on. Also, the fact that he's defensive and dismissive of her feelings after the argument might indicate a lack of commitment to rebuilding the relationship. \n\nSo considering all that, the wife isn't being unrealistic. She's holding him accountable as per their agreement and the therapist's guidance. The husband's actions undermined their progress. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
