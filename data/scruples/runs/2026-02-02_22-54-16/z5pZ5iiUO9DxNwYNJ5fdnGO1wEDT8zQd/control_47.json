Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is a wife who's dealing with her husband's affairs. They had a therapy session where they agreed on guidelines for him to rebuild trust, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband broke the agreement by staying out past 10, even after the author reminded him of the importance of following through. He then argues and even uses \"Jim\" as an excuse, which adds to her frustration. She ended up getting angry and threatening to leave if he didn't come home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, so trust is a major issue. Therapy guidelines are part of the process to rebuild that trust. The author set boundaries, which the husband agreed to. Breaking those boundaries could be seen as undermining the trust-building process. The wife's reaction seems to be about maintaining the agreed rules, which is reasonable in the context of their situation. She's not just being controlling but trying to enforce what they both agreed upon under the guidance of a therapist.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that the rules are too restrictive. However, since he agreed to them, breaking them is his fault. His argument that \"it's just one guy\" doesn't justify breaking the agreement. The fact that he's now refusing to follow the rules and says they only have 2 weeks left could indicate he's not taking the process seriously, which is problematic.\n\nThe wife's anger is justified because the husband went back on his word, which is crucial when rebuilding trust. Using \"Jim\" to make her feel guilty is a manipulative tactic that's not acceptable. Her response to tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, she'll leave is a strong statement but might be necessary given the circumstances. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's upholding the agreed-upon boundaries to rebuild trust, which is essential after infidelity. The husband's actions and arguments are the ones that are problematic here. So, the answer should be B.\n"
