Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife who's dealing with her husband's affairs. They had an agreement through therapy: he should be home by 10 PM and no drinking with women. He broke that agreement by staying out past 10, even after agreeing to it. She stood her ground, and they had a big fight. He later says he won't follow the rules anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, which is a major issue. The therapist's advice was to set guidelines for accountability. The wife is trying to rebuild trust, so the rules are part of the healing process. When he breaks the agreement, she's justified in being upset. He didn't follow through on his commitment, which shows a lack of accountability. \n\nHe tried to make excuses, like \"just one guy\" and \"Jim is mad at me,\" which seems like he's shifting blame. The wife's response was to stand her ground and hold him accountable, which is reasonable given the circumstances. She's not being unrealistic\u2014she's enforcing a rule they agreed on. \n\nIs she in the wrong? It doesn't seem so. She's trying to maintain the agreed-upon boundaries for the marriage's sake. His breaking the rule and not taking responsibility is the issue here. So the answer should be B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
