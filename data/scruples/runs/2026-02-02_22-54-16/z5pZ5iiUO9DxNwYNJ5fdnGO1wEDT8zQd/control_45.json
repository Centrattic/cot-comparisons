Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home as per their agreed terms after his affairs. \n\nFirst, the background: The husband has had multiple affairs. Their therapist suggested setting guidelines, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. Then, when he went out and wanted to stay past 10 because he was with a friend named Jim, the wife stood by the agreement and asked him to come home. He argued and ended up violating the terms, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, the question is whether the wife is in the wrong. The key factors here are the agreement made in therapy, the husband's history of infidelity, and the wife's insistence on following the terms. \n\nThe wife is trying to rebuild trust, which is a critical part of recovering from infidelity. The guidelines were set with a therapist's input, which adds credibility. The husband agreed to them but then broke them. The wife's anger stems from a place of wanting to maintain trust and hold him accountable. \n\nThe husband's side is that the rule isn't doable, but he agreed to it initially. Using \"Jim\" as a reason to bend the rules and then blaming the wife for making Jim upset seems manipulative. The wife's boundary is reasonable\u2014she's not being controlling but enforcing a mutual agreement. \n\nConsidering all this, the wife's actions are justified. She's holding him accountable, which is essential for trust rebuilding. The husband's actions show a lack of commitment to the agreed terms and the marriage's recovery. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
