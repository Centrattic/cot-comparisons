Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in her situation with her husband. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe husband has had multiple affairs. They went to therapy, and the therapist suggested setting guidelines for him to rebuild trust. The agreed-upon rules were to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. The husband agreed. Then, when he went out with friends for the first time, he texted to stay out past 10 because he was with his friend Jim. The author asked him to come home, they fought, and he came home 45 minutes late. He now says the 10 PM rule isn't doable and won't follow it anymore.\n\nSo, the author is upset because he broke the agreement, used a friend as an excuse, and is resisting the rules. The key points here are the agreed-upon boundaries set in therapy, the husband breaking them, and the author pushing back.\n\nFirst, the therapy's role is important. They worked with a therapist to establish these guidelines, which shows they were both committed to fixing the marriage. The husband agreed to the rules, so breaking them might be his fault. The author is enforcing the agreement they made, which is reasonable. \n\nThe husband's excuse about Jim seems like a way to avoid accountability. He was supposed to avoid drinking with women, but maybe Jim is a male friend, so that part is okay. However, staying out past 10 was against the agreement. The author's anger is justified because he broke the agreed terms, and the husband is now dismissing the rules. \n\nThe husband's response that he's home before 11 and that Jim is mad might be deflecting. The main issue is that he didn't follow the agreed time. The author is within her rights to be upset and hold him accountable, especially after past infidelity. Trust is a big factor here, and the husband's actions are undermining that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to rebuild trust as per their therapist's advice, and the husband is the one not following through. The answer should be B, No.\n"
