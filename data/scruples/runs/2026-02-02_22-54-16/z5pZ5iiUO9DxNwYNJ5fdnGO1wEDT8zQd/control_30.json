Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs who agreed to certain guidelines set by their therapist and wife: being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. He broke these rules by staying out past 10, using the excuse that there were no women left and that he's with a friend named Jim. The wife is upset and confronts him, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, the husband had agreed to the guidelines, so breaking them seems like a breach of trust. The therapist's advice was to hold him accountable, which the wife is doing. She asked him to come home as agreed, which is reasonable given the history of affairs. His argument about Jim trying to make her feel guilty is a classic deflection. The wife's reaction of anger is justified because he violated the agreed terms. He's also dismissing her feelings by saying Jim is mad at her, which doesn't excuse his behavior. The question is whether she's being unrealistic. Since they had a specific agreement and he failed to follow it without valid reason, she's within her rights to be upset. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
