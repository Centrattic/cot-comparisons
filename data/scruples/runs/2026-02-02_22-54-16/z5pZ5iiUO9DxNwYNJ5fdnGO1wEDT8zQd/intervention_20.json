Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they've agreed on some guidelines with their therapist, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the agreement by staying out past 10, argues with the author, and then doubles down by saying the rule isn't doable anymore.\n\nFirst, the author set up boundaries through therapy, which the husband agreed to. The husband then violates those boundaries. The author is upset because he's not following through, which is understandable given the history of infidelity. The husband tries to justify it by saying it's just one guy left and he shouldn't have to come home, which seems like he's making excuses. Then he even says that the friend is now mad at the author, trying to guilt-trip her.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. From what I can see, the author is trying to rebuild trust by holding the husband accountable. The husband isn't respecting the agreed-upon rules, which is a problem. The argument the husband makes seems weak and self-serving. The author's reaction\u2014expressing her feelings and setting a boundary by threatening to leave if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage\u2014is a valid response given the circumstances. \n\nI don't see any evidence that the author is being unreasonable. The husband agreed to the terms, broke them, and then tried to shift responsibility. The author is justified in her anger and the steps she's taking to protect the marriage. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
