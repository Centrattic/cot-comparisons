Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her husband to come home by 10 PM as agreed during therapy. The husband had multiple affairs, and they set guidelines to rebuild trust. The husband went out with friends, got a late text, and then argued about the rules.\n\nFirst, the context is that they were in therapy, and the husband agreed to these guidelines. Breaking them would be a problem. She's trying to rebuild trust, so holding him accountable makes sense. He initially agreed but then went back on his word, which is a breach of trust. \n\nHe claims that being home by 10 isn't doable anymore. But they had a one-month plan, so it's not like it's a permanent rule. He also used another person, \"Jim,\" to justify staying out, which might be a distraction tactic. His response after coming home late and dismissing her feelings could indicate a lack of commitment to the agreement.\n\nThe author's anger is justified because her husband violated the agreed-upon rules without valid reason. She's not being unrealistic; she's enforcing what they both committed to. The husband's behavior suggests he's not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust, which is a key part of the therapist's advice. Using guilt (Jim being mad) is a manipulative tactic. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the husband is. Answer B.\n"
