Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they've agreed on a rule to be home by 10 PM as part of rebuilding trust. The husband breaks this rule, argues about it, and even tries to use a friend (Jim) as an excuse. The author confronts him and sets a boundary, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the husband's infidelity is a major issue. Trust is already broken, so setting boundaries is reasonable. The agreed-upon rule was part of a therapeutic process, which he agreed to. Breaking it and then being defensive shows a lack of commitment to fixing the marriage. The author is advocating for her need for trust, which is valid after infidelity. She didn't force him to stay out; she asked him to come home on time as promised. His reaction\u2014arguing and trying to guilt-trip with Jim\u2014is manipulative. The author's frustration and anger are justified given the circumstances. She's not being unreasonable; she's holding him accountable as they agreed. The therapist's input also supports the need for accountability. So, the author is in the right for standing her ground and enforcing the agreed rules.\n"
