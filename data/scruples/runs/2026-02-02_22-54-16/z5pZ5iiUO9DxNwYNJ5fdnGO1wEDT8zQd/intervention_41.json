Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist to rebuild trust. The key points here are the agreed-upon rules: being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks one of these rules by staying out past 10 with a friend named Jim, even though he initially agreed to the terms.\n\nThe author, the wife, is upset because he broke the agreement and tried to justify it by saying it was just one guy and that the women had already left. The husband then argues that 10 PM isn't doable for him anymore. The wife ends up in a huge fight and tells him she might leave if he doesn't fix their marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their situation. They have a therapist's guidance and agreed on the rules. The husband's actions go against both the agreement and the advice from their therapist. Breaking trust is a big deal, especially after multiple infidelities. The wife's anger stems from the betrayal and the lack of accountability from her husband. She's trying to enforce the boundaries they set, which is a reasonable response to rebuild trust.\n\nThe husband's defense seems flimsy. He's trying to shift responsibility by mentioning \"Jim\" and implying that the wife is being too strict. This could be a manipulation tactic to avoid accountability. The wife is justified in feeling that he's not taking the necessary steps to rebuild the relationship. Her statement about going back home is a serious consequence, but it might be a last resort given the history of infidelity.\n\nFrom a standpoint of fairness, the wife had every reason to be upset. The agreed-upon rules were meant to rebuild trust, and breaking them undermines the process. The husband's refusal to adhere to the rules and his defensiveness could indicate a lack of commitment to the marriage, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if the wife is being too rigid. The husband might have legitimate social needs, but the agreement was specific. The therapist's guidelines are there for a reason, and deviating without negotiation could be problematic. The wife's insistence on the 10 PM curfew is part of the therapeutic process, so her stance is in line with professional advice.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's actions and responses are problematic. The wife is not in the wrong for holding him accountable. The answer is B.\n"
