Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband having multiple affairs, and the couple set guidelines with their therapist for him to follow to rebuild trust. The key points are: the husband agreed to be home by 10 and not drink with women. Then he went out, had a guy named Jim left, and asked to stay out, which the author said no to. They fought, and he came home late, arguing that texting before 11 is good enough and that Jim is mad. The author is upset because he broke his word and tried to use Jim to guilt-trip her.\n\nSo, first, the husband has a history of infidelity. The therapist's guidelines are part of a structured plan to rebuild trust. The author is following the therapist's advice by enforcing the agreed-upon rules. When the husband breaks the agreement, she's firm in her response. He's not holding up his end of the deal, which is crucial for trust rebuilding. His argument that he was almost on time and that Jim is now mad seems to be an excuse. The author's anger is justified because he violated their agreement and tried to shift blame. \n\nIs she being unrealistic? The rules were set through therapy, which is a professional setting. The time frame is only a month, so the rules are temporary. The husband agreed to them, so expecting him to follow through isn't unreasonable. The fact that he went back on his word and tried to use another person to justify it makes her anger valid. She's trying to hold him accountable as per the therapist's advice. The husband's resistance here is a problem because he's the one who needs to change his behavior. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's enforcing the agreed terms, which are necessary for trust. The husband's actions and excuses are part of the issue in the relationship.\n"
