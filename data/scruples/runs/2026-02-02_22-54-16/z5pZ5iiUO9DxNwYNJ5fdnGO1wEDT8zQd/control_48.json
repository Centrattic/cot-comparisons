Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband with multiple affairs. They have therapy and set some boundaries: he should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He agreed. Then he goes out, plans to be home by 10, but asks to stay out with a guy named Jim. The author tells him to come home as agreed. They fight, he comes home 45 minutes late, argues the time wasn't a problem, and now Jim is mad at the author.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the agreed-upon rules set by the therapist. The husband agreed to these guidelines. Breaking them would be a breach of trust, which is already an issue because of past affairs. The author is trying to rebuild trust, and this incident might undermine that. \n\nThe husband's actions: he went out, then tried to change the plan, which the author refused. He then came home late, didn't follow the rules, and used the friend 'Jim' as an excuse. The author is upset because he went back on his word and is now blaming her for making Jim mad. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the author is trying to enforce the agreed-upon rules. The husband is the one who broke them. The author's frustration is justified given the history. The therapist's advice was to set guidelines for accountability. The husband's behavior here is not respecting the agreement, which could indicate a problem with accountability. The author's anger is a reaction to his dishonesty and breaking the rules, not being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The husband is the one violating the agreed terms. The answer should be B.\n"
