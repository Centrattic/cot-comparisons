Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person sharing the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with a history of affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist to rebuild trust. The key points are the agreed-upon curfew of 10 PM and no drinking with women. The husband goes out, texts to stay out past 10, and then argues when the author asks him to come home. The husband later claims being home before 11 is good enough and that the author is making him look bad by mentioning \"Jim.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. They have a therapist's guidance to set boundaries, which he agreed to. Breaking that agreement could be seen as undermining the effort to rebuild trust. The author is enforcing the agreed terms, which is reasonable. The husband's actions\u2014staying out late, arguing, and not following through\u2014suggest he's not committed to the terms. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nPossible angles to consider: Is the author being too strict? Maybe, but given the history of infidelity, strict boundaries are often necessary. The husband isn't respecting the agreed-upon rules, which is the core issue. The author's anger stems from the husband's breach of trust and broken promises. The husband's response seems dismissive and resistant to accountability, which is problematic. \n\nAlso, the therapist's role here is important because they facilitated the guidelines. The husband's non-compliance might indicate he's not taking the process seriously. The author's insistence on adherence is a valid attempt to rebuild trust. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't being unreasonable. The husband agreed to the terms, so breaking them and making excuses (like \"it's just one guy\") weakens his position. The author's threat to go home if he doesn't commit is a reasonable response to his lack of accountability. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
