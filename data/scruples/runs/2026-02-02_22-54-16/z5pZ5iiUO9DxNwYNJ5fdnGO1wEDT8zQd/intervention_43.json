Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who has had multiple affairs, and they set up guidelines with their therapist. The specific rule was that he should be home by 10 PM. He went out with friends, texted to stay out, and then came home late. The wife confronts him, they fight, and he says the rule isn't doable anymore. The author is wondering if she's being too strict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple is in therapy working on rebuilding trust after infidelity. The husband agreed to the guidelines, which includes a curfew. Breaking that agreement could be seen as a step back in the recovery process. The wife is enforcing the boundaries they set, which is part of the therapist's recommendation. \n\nThe husband's actions\u2014breaking the agreed-upon rule, arguing, and then dismissing her concerns\u2014might indicate a lack of commitment to the agreed terms. The wife's frustration is justified because he broke the trust-building measure. She's holding him accountable, which is necessary for the therapist's plan to work. \n\nHe's trying to make excuses and even uses the \"Jim\" situation to shift blame. That's not good communication. The wife's anger is a response to his violation of the agreed terms. She's not demanding unreasonable things; she's enforcing what both parties agreed upon. \n\nThe key points are: agreed rules, violation of those rules, and the husband's resistance to accountability. The wife is trying to maintain the structure needed for trust to rebuild. The husband's refusal to follow the guidelines suggests he's not taking the necessary steps to mend the relationship. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. She's sticking to the plan they established in therapy. The husband's behavior is the issue. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
