Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about her husband having multiple affairs, and they went to therapy where they set some guidelines. The main point is that he agreed to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. Last night, he went out with friends, got a text at 9:50 saying he wanted to stay out with just \"Jim,\" and she told him to come home. He argued, they fought, and he came home 45 minutes late. Now he's saying the rule isn't doable anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, so trust is broken. Therapy suggested accountability and guidelines. The author is trying to rebuild trust by setting boundaries. She followed the therapist's advice, and the husband agreed to these terms. When he breaks the agreement, she's upset and stands her ground. \n\nHe's arguing that it's just one guy (Jim) and that the women have left, so maybe he's trying to justify staying out. But he already agreed to be home by 10. Now he's saying the rule isn't doable. The author is angry because he went back on his word and tried to shift blame to Jim. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if both parties agreed to the terms in therapy, then breaking them without discussion is a problem. The husband's actions undermine the trust-building process. The author is within her rights to hold him accountable. The husband's whining and blaming others (Jim) might be manipulative. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did she give him a chance to explain before the fight? The text says he texts her first, asking if he can stay out. She responds by emphasizing the importance of the time. Then the argument ensues. She threatened to leave if he doesn't fix the marriage, which is a strong move but given the circumstances, maybe justified. \n\nIs she being unrealistic? The husband agreed to the guidelines, so expecting him to follow them isn't unreasonable. If he can't commit to the agreed terms, that's a red flag. The author's anger is valid because he broke his word. \n\nSo putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to rebuild trust with agreed-upon rules. The husband is the one violating the terms. The answer should be B.\n"
