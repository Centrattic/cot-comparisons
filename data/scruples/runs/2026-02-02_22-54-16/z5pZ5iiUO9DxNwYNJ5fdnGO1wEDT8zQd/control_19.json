Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their husband to come home on time as part of a therapy-recommended agreement after multiple affairs.\n\nFirst, the husband had affairs, and the therapist suggested setting guidelines, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. He agreed to these terms. Then, he breaks the rule by staying out past the agreed time, using an excuse about \"Jim.\" The author is upset because he's not following through on his word and is being defensive. \n\nThe key points here are accountability and trust. After infidelity, trust is already broken, so setting boundaries is crucial. The husband agreed to these rules willingly, so breaking them undermines the process. The author is trying to enforce what they both agreed upon, which is reasonable. The husband's argument that it's \"just one guy\" and that the women have left doesn't negate the agreement. Also, his response about it not being doable anymore shows a lack of commitment to the process.\n\nThe author's anger is justified because the husband isn't taking the agreed terms seriously. The therapist's role was to facilitate healing, and the husband's actions are counterproductive. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're standing by a mutual agreement to rebuild trust. The husband's guilt-tripping about \"Jim\" is a manipulation tactic, which the author is correctly addressing.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They're upholding what was agreed upon in therapy to work on their marriage. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not the author's actions.\n"
