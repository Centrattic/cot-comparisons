Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home on time after he agreed to certain guidelines set by their therapist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband has had multiple affairs, and the therapist suggested guidelines, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. He agreed to this. Then, when he went out with friends and wanted to stay out past 10, the author asked him to come home. He argued, stayed out, came home late, and then criticized her for making him choose between her and his friend Jim. \n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The author followed the therapist's advice by setting boundaries to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to those terms but didn't follow through. He broke the agreement and then blamed the author for the conflict. Trust is crucial here, and breaking agreed terms can undermine the rebuilding process. The author's frustration and anger seem justified because he went back on his word. \n\nThe husband's argument that it's just one guy and that the women have left doesn't negate the agreement. The rules were about his actions, not others' presence. Also, using Jim as a reason to stay out and then making the author feel guilty is manipulative. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to maintain the trust-building process, which is essential after infidelity. The husband's actions and response are the issues here.\n"
