Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home as agreed, given the context of his past affairs and the therapy guidelines they set.\n\nFirst, the husband has had multiple affairs, which is a serious issue in their marriage. The therapist recommended specific guidelines, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. \n\nThen, when he went out with friends (one of whom is Jim), he was late and tried to justify staying out by saying Jim is still there. The wife stood by the agreement, leading to a fight. The husband later claims that being home by 10 isn't doable and won't follow it anymore, even though the month isn't up. \n\nThe key points here are the agreed-upon boundaries and the husband's actions. The wife is enforcing the rules they set during therapy, which he initially accepted. His breaking the agreement and then dismissing the rules undermines the trust-building process. The wife's anger is understandable given the history of infidelity and the need for accountability. \n\nThe husband's argument that it's \"just one guy\" and that all the women have left seems like he's trivializing the issue and trying to shift blame. The wife isn't being unrealistic by holding him to the terms they mutually agreed on. His refusal to follow through and the guilt-tripping about Jim might be manipulative tactics. \n\nSo, considering the context of rebuilding trust after infidelity, the wife's actions are justified. She's not in the wrong for upholding the agreed guidelines. The husband is the one who violated the terms and is now resisting accountability. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
