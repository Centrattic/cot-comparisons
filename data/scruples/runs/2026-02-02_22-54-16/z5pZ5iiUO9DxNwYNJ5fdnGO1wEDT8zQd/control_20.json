Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a husband who has had multiple affairs and agreed to certain guidelines in therapy with his wife. The key points are that they set a rule for him to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He went out with friends, broke the rule by staying out past 10, then used \"Jim\" as an excuse and argued with the wife, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The husband had agreed to specific terms in therapy, which is a structured setting meant to address his infidelity and rebuild trust. Breaking that agreement, even once, could be seen as undermining the effort to rebuild trust. The wife is standing by the agreed-upon rules, which were part of a therapeutic process they both committed to. \n\nThe husband's response involves breaking the rule (staying out past 10) and then justifying it by saying it's just one guy and that \"Jim\" is mad at the wife. This seems like he's making excuses and trying to shift responsibility or guilt-trip her. The wife, on the other hand, is firm in her stance, emphasizing the importance of the rule for her trust. She also sets a boundary by stating that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, she'll leave. That's a strong statement, but given the context of multiple affairs and the need for accountability, it might be a valid expression of her limits.\n\nThe question is whether the wife is wrong for enforcing the rule. Since the husband agreed to the terms and then violated them, the wife's reaction is about holding him accountable. The therapist's role was to establish these guidelines, so the wife is following the agreed structure. The husband's argument about not being able to stick to the rule and dropping it after 2 weeks suggests he's not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust actively. \n\nConsidering all this, the wife isn't being unrealistic. She's trying to follow the therapeutic guidelines they set together. The husband's actions, not hers, are the problem here. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
