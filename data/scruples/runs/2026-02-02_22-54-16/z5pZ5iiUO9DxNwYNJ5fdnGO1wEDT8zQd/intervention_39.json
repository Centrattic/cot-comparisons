Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a husband with multiple affairs and a therapy agreement to set guidelines, like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband broke the agreement by staying out past 10, argued with the wife, and dismissed her concerns. The author is the wife who followed through with the agreed rules and expressed her anger when he didn't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had a therapist's guidance to establish boundaries for rebuilding trust. The husband agreed to the terms but violated them. The wife's reaction seems to stem from a place of needing trust and security after infidelity. She's enforcing the agreement, which he initially agreed to, so she's not unreasonable. \n\nThe husband's arguments about \"just one guy\" and changing the rules undermine the trust-building process. His behavior of breaking the agreement and making excuses (like saying 10 isn't doable) shows a lack of commitment to the agreed-upon terms. The wife's anger is justified because he went back on his word, which is critical after infidelity. \n\nThe user mentioned the husband even tried to guilt-trip her by saying \"Jim\" is mad at her. That's manipulative and invalidates her concerns. The author's stance is about holding him accountable, which is necessary for trust. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking steps to protect her marriage and rebuild trust as advised by their therapist. So the answer should be B.\n"
