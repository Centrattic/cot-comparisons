Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home by 10 PM as agreed. The husband had multiple affairs, and they set guidelines in therapy. He agreed to the rules but broke them again.\n\nFirst, the wife's actions: She followed the therapist's advice to set boundaries. When he tried to stay out later, she stood by the agreement. She got angry because he broke his word, which makes sense given the context of his past cheating. His response seems dismissive and even manipulative by bringing up \"Jim\" to guilt-trip her. \n\nThe husband's behavior is problematic. He agreed to the rules but didn't follow through. Arguing about it and then making excuses, especially after the fact, shows a lack of accountability. The therapist's role was to help rebuild trust, so the husband's non-compliance undermines that process. The wife's anger and insistence on him following through are justified because trust is crucial after infidelity. \n\nIs the author being unrealistic? The rule seems reasonable\u201410 PM curfew and not drinking with women. It's a temporary measure, just one month. The husband's refusal to adhere to it, especially after agreeing, makes the wife's stance valid. She's trying to protect the marriage and her own mental health by enforcing boundaries. \n\nThe husband's response that he's only got two weeks left suggests he's not taking the guidelines seriously, which is a red flag. The wife's reaction to call it quits if he's not committed is understandable given the history. \n\nOverall, the wife is in the right for holding him accountable. The husband's actions are the issue here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
