Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a husband who's had multiple affairs, and they've set some guidelines in therapy to rebuild trust. The key points are the agreed-upon rules: being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the first rule by staying out past 10, argues with the wife, and she confronts him, leading to a big fight. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the wife was wrong to enforce the agreement. Since they set these guidelines in therapy, they're part of a structured plan to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to them, so breaking them would be a breach of trust. The wife's anger and insistence on him following through seem justified given their history. \n\nThen, his response: he comes home late, justifies it as \"good enough,\" and uses \"Jim\" to guilt-trip her. That's manipulative behavior. The wife's reaction\u2014telling him she'll leave if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage\u2014shows she's trying to hold him accountable. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to consider if her expectations are realistic. The rules were part of a time-limited plan (a month), and he's only half through. So, enforcing the rules for the duration makes sense. The husband's refusal to comply undermines the agreed-upon steps. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the wife is being too strict, but given the context of affairs and the therapeutic plan, strictness is part of rebuilding trust. The husband breaking the agreement first. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's upholding their agreement and addressing the husband's dishonesty and broken promises.\n"
