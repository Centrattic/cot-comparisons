Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband having multiple affairs, and they set guidelines with their therapist, like coming home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the agreement by staying out past 10 with a guy named Jim, argues with the author, and then refuses to follow the rules anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The therapist's advice was that the husband needs to be held accountable and follow guidelines to rebuild trust. The author and her husband agreed to these terms. The husband broke the agreement by staying out past the agreed time. The author is upset because he went back on his word and tried to use \"Jim\" as an excuse. \n\nThe key points here are accountability and trust. In a situation with a history of infidelity, trust is fragile. The author is trying to enforce the boundaries set in therapy to rebuild that trust. The husband not only broke the rule but also dismissed her feelings and tried to make her feel guilty with the Jim situation. That's a red flag. His behavior could indicate a lack of commitment to fixing the relationship. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014expressing anger and even threatening to leave if he doesn't want to fix the marriage\u2014shows she's holding him accountable. It's reasonable for her to be upset because he broke their agreement. The therapist's guidelines are part of the process, and the husband's refusal to follow them undermines the entire effort. \n\nSome might argue that the husband's desire for flexibility is understandable, but in this context, the rules are non-negotiable for trust-building. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's following the steps advised by a professional. The husband's actions and responses (whining, not taking the rules seriously) suggest he's not committed to the process, which makes the author's frustration valid. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband is the one breaking the agreed terms and not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust. The answer should be B (No).\n"
