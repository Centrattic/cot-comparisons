Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home by 10 PM and being upset when he didn't. The context is that the husband has had multiple affairs, and they've set boundaries through therapy.\n\nFirst, the therapist's role here is important. They came up with guidelines together, so the husband agreed to these terms. The husband then broke the agreement by staying out past 10, even after assuring her he would comply. The author is upset because he broke his word and used \"Jim\" as an excuse, which makes her feel guilty. \n\nI need to consider if the author was being too strict or if she's justified. The husband's history of affairs adds context. Trust is crucial here, and breaking the agreed terms could be seen as undermining the therapy's recommendations. The husband's argument about \"just one guy\" might not be a valid excuse, especially since he had already agreed to the rule. Also, his reaction\u2014whining and arguing\u2014could be part of the problem. The author's response to call him out and express her anger is a reasonable reaction given the circumstances.\n\nThe husband's claim that 10 PM isn't doable and that he won't follow the rule anymore is problematic. He's not holding up his end of the agreement, which the therapist suggested was necessary for rebuilding trust. The author is justified in feeling angry and in the right to enforce the boundaries they set together. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
