Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home as agreed. The husband has a history of affairs, and they've set guidelines with their therapist. The key points here are the agreed-upon rules: being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband broke the first rule by staying out past 10, and he argues that it's just one guy left, so it's okay. The author is upset because he's breaking the agreement they made to rebuild trust. The therapist emphasized accountability, and the husband is now refusing to follow the rules, even after the argument.\n\nFirst, the rules were agreed upon with the therapist's guidance. The husband initially agreed to them, so breaking that agreement seems like a breach of trust. The author is within her right to be upset and to enforce the rules they set. The husband's behavior of trying to make an exception (\"it's just one guy\") undermines the trust-building process. Also, his response after coming home late\u2014defending it and making the other guy mad\u2014doesn't show accountability. The author's anger is justified because the husband isn't following through on his commitments. She's not being unrealistic; she's holding him to the agreement they both made. The fact that he's now refusing to follow the rules and only has two weeks left suggests a pattern of non-compliance, which is problematic. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's trying to maintain the boundaries necessary for the marriage to heal.\n"
