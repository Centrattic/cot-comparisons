Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband with multiple affairs, and they're in therapy working on rebuilding trust. The couple set up guidelines with the therapist: he should be home by 10 and avoid drinking with women. The husband went out with friends, including someone named Jim, and when he wanted to stay out past 10, the author insisted he come home on time. They fought, and he later dismissed the rule, saying 10 isn't doable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, which is a big deal. The therapist's guidelines are part of a structured plan to rebuild trust. The author followed the agreed-upon rules, and the husband broke them. When the author asked him to come home on time, he resisted and even tried to use Jim as an excuse, which the author found manipulative.\n\nThe key points here are: the husband agreed to the rules, then broke them. The author is enforcing the boundaries set in therapy, which is a reasonable response to his past behavior. The husband's reaction\u2014arguing, whining, and then dismissing the rule\u2014suggests he's not taking the agreed-upon steps seriously, which could hinder rebuilding trust. The author's anger seems justified given the circumstances and history. So, it's more likely that the husband is in the wrong here, not the author. The author is holding him accountable, which is necessary when there's a history of infidelity. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
