Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home by 10 PM as agreed, after his infidelity and the therapist's guidelines.\n\nFirst, the husband has a history of affairs, so trust is a huge issue here. The therapist recommended setting guidelines, and both agreed to these, including the 10 PM curfew and not drinking with women. The husband then goes out and texts to stay out past 10, even though he had agreed to follow the rules. He then argues about it, leading to a big fight where the wife threatens to leave if he doesn't fix the marriage. He comes home late and dismisses the agreement, saying the time isn't doable anymore.\n\nThe key points here are the agreed-upon boundaries set by the therapist for rebuilding trust. The husband broke those terms, which the wife is holding him accountable for. His excuses (it's just one guy, Jim) seem like attempts to avoid responsibility. The wife is justified in being upset because he broke his word, especially given the context of past infidelity. His response, claiming the rule isn't doable and that Jim is mad, shifts blame and doesn't take accountability.\n\nThe author is standing by the agreed terms, which were part of a professional therapeutic process. Her anger stems from his dishonesty and breach of trust. She's not being unreasonable; she's enforcing the boundaries he agreed to. The husband's behavior shows a lack of commitment to the agreed-upon steps, which is the core issue here. So, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
