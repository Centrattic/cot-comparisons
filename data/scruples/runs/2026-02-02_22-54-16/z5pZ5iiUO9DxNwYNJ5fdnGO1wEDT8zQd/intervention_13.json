Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a husband who agreed to certain boundaries set by his wife and therapist after multiple affairs. The key points here are the agreed-upon rules, the husband breaking them, and the resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, the couple had a therapist's guidance to set guidelines for a month. The husband agreed to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He then went out with friends, was late, and tried to justify it by saying he was with just one guy now. The author (wife) is upset because he broke the agreement, leading to a fight. He later argues that the time isn't doable and won't follow it anymore, even though the month isn't over.\n\nI need to evaluate if the wife was wrong to enforce the rules. The husband agreed to them, so breaking them without discussion would be a problem. The wife is trying to rebuild trust, so holding him accountable makes sense. The husband's behavior\u2014backing out of the agreement and using his friend as an excuse\u2014seems to undermine the process. The wife's anger seems justified given the history of affairs and the agreed terms. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The key factors are the agreed boundaries, the husband's breach, and the wife's legitimate effort to maintain trust.\n"
