Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband having multiple affairs, and they've been to therapy where they set guidelines, like the husband being home by 10 and not drinking with women. He agreed to these terms. Last night, he went out with friends, said he'd be home by 10, but at 9:50 he texted asking if he could stay out because he was with Jim. The author asked him to come home as agreed, leading to a big fight. The husband then came home 45 minutes late, claimed he was home before 11, texted before 10, and even said Jim is mad at the author. The author is upset because he broke his word and tried to guilt-trip her with Jim.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The husband has a history of affairs, so trust is a major issue. They set boundaries in therapy with the husband's consent. He agreed to be home by 10. He deviated from that, then tried to justify it with the presence of Jim. The author is enforcing the agreement, which was part of a plan to rebuild trust. The husband not only broke the rule but also dismissed her feelings and tried to shift blame. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider the context of the husband's past behavior and the agreed-upon rules. Breaking those rules and not following through on commitments would likely be the husband's fault. The author is holding him accountable, which seems reasonable given their therapist's advice. The husband's argument that it's \"just one guy\" and that he's been home before 11 doesn't hold up, especially since he agreed to the rule in the first place. The fact that he's in the final weeks of this period might indicate he's not committed to following through, which is problematic. The author's anger at his breaking the agreement and using Jim as an excuse is justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
