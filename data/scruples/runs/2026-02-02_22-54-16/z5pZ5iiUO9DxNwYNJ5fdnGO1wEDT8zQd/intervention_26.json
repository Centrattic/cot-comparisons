Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with a history of affairs and a marital agreement made during therapy. The key points are the agreed-upon rules, the husband's breach of those rules, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the couple worked with their therapist to set guidelines: the husband should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He agreed to this. Then, when he wanted to stay out later with just one friend, he broke the agreement. The author stood by the rules, which makes sense because trust is crucial after infidelity. The husband's reasoning that it's \"just one guy\" and that the women have left doesn't negate the agreed boundaries. Using \"Jim\" as an excuse might be a way to avoid accountability. The author's anger is justified as he's undermining the rebuilding process. The therapist's advice was about accountability, which the husband isn't following. The author isn't being unrealistic; she's enforcing the agreed terms. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
