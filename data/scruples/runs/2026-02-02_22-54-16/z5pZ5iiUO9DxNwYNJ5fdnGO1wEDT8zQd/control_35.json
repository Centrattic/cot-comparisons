Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple with a history of infidelity. They've set up boundaries with their therapist: the husband needs to be home by 10 and not drink with women. He agreed, but then he went out with friends, broke the 10 PM rule, and tried to justify it by saying he was with just one guy and women had left. The wife is upset because he didn't follow the agreed-upon guidelines and even tried to use \"Jim\" to make her feel guilty. They fought, and the husband ended up being 45 minutes late.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the wife was wrong. The key points here are the agreed-upon terms from therapy, the husband's actions violating those terms, and the wife's reaction. The wife was following the therapist's advice to hold him accountable. The husband agreed to the terms but then broke them. His argument that the rule isn't \"doable\" and that he's only got 2 weeks left seems like he's dismissing the agreed-upon boundaries. The wife's anger stems from his betrayal of trust and the fact that he's not following through on commitments made in therapy. The husband's attempt to justify his actions by blaming \"Jim\" might be a manipulation tactic, which is a red flag.\n\nSo, the wife is trying to rebuild trust by enforcing the boundaries. The husband's non-compliance and defensiveness are problematic. The wife isn't being unrealistic; she's holding him to the agreement they made. The husband's refusal to follow the rules undermines the therapy process and the effort to repair the marriage. Therefore, the author (the wife) is not in the wrong. Her actions are justified given the circumstances and the agreed-upon terms.\n"
