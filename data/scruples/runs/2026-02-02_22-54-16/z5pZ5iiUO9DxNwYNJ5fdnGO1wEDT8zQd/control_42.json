Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs and agreed guidelines from their therapist. The key points are the guidelines he agreed to: home by 10 and no drinking with women. He went out with friends, stayed past 10, and then used \"Jim\" as an excuse.\n\nThe author is upset because he broke the agreed terms, even if it was just one instance. The therapist's advice was about accountability and rebuilding trust. The husband is now dismissing the agreement, saying 10 PM isn't doable anymore. \n\nThe author's actions were to set a boundary based on their agreement. He agreed to the rules, so breaking them undermines the therapy's purpose. The fight escalated, but the core issue is his failure to follow through. The author isn't being unreasonable; trust is a big factor here. The husband's behavior, including using \"Jim\" as a guilt-trip, is problematic.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband is the one who broke the agreement and is resisting accountability. So the answer should be B.\n"
