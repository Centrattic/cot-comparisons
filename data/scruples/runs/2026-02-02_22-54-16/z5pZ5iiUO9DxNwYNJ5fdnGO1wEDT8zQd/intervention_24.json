Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong after telling her husband to come home on time. The husband has had multiple affairs, and they had agreed with their therapist on a guideline: he should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He went out with friends, assured her he'd be back by 10, but then asked to stay out when it was 9:50, arguing it's just one guy left. They fought, and he came home 45 minutes late, defending his actions and saying the rule isn't doable anymore.\n\nFirst, the husband broke the agreed-upon rule. He had committed to following the guidelines set by therapy to rebuild trust. By staying out past 10, he's not adhering to the terms they both agreed on. The wife is within her rights to hold him accountable, especially given his history of infidelity. Trust is crucial here, and breaking the rule undermines the efforts to rebuild it.\n\nHe also tried to manipulate the situation by bringing up \"Jim\" to guilt-trait her. That's a red flag. He's not taking responsibility but instead shifting blame. The wife's anger is justified because he went back on his word and didn't follow through with the agreed terms. The therapist's role was to create a structure for accountability, so the husband's refusal to stick to it is a major issue.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The key points are whether the wife was being unrealistic. Given the husband's history and the agreed rules, her expectations seem reasonable. The problem lies in the husband's non-compliance and lack of accountability, not the wife's demands. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
