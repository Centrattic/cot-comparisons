Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the husband has multiple affairs, which is a serious issue. The couple worked with a therapist to set guidelines, including being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these. However, when going out with friends, he stays out past the agreed time, argues about it, and then tries to justify it by saying he was home before 11, but still late by 45 minutes. He also brings in \"Jim\" to make the author feel guilty.\n\nThe author is upset because he broke the agreement, and she called him out on it. The therapist had suggested accountability, so she's following through. The husband is resisting the boundaries, which could hinder rebuilding trust. The key here is whether the author is being unfair. The guidelines were agreed upon, and the husband didn't follow them. The author is enforcing the terms they set together. The husband's argument that staying out is okay because the women left seems like an excuse. Also, using Jim to guilt-trip her might be a manipulation tactic. The author's anger stems from broken trust and a failure to adhere to the agreed-upon terms. The therapist's advice was to hold him accountable, so the author is actually following professional guidance. It seems like the husband is the one not respecting the agreement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
