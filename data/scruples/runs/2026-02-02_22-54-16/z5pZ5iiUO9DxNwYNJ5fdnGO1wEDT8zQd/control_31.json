Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and the couple is working with a therapist to rebuild trust. The therapist suggested guidelines: husband must be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. The husband agreed but then went out with friends, stayed out past 10, and tried to justify it by saying he was with \"Jim\" and that the women had already left. The author confronted him, leading to a big fight, and the husband is now resistant to following the guidelines.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, and the couple's therapist set up specific guidelines to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to these terms. Breaking those terms would be a violation of the agreed-upon rules, which are crucial for trust rebuilding. The author is within her rights to enforce the agreement they made, especially since the therapist recommended it. \n\nThe husband's behavior here is problematic. He agreed to the rules but then tried to bend them, using his friend \"Jim\" as an excuse. This seems like a manipulation tactic to avoid accountability. The author's anger is justified because the husband is not holding up his end of the agreement, which was part of the therapeutic process. The fact that the husband is now arguing that the rule isn't doable and refusing to follow it further undermines the trust-building efforts. \n\nThe author's response\u2014insisting on the original agreement and expressing her need for trust\u2014is reasonable. She's not being unrealistic; she's adhering to the agreed-upon boundaries. The husband's actions and excuses show a lack of commitment to the process, which is a bigger issue. \n\nThe user might be thinking that maybe the author is being too strict, but given the context of infidelity and the structured approach from the therapist, the author is actually upholding a necessary agreement. The husband's resistance and attempts to shift blame (using \"Jim\") indicate his unwillingness to be held accountable, which is the real problem here. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. She's acting appropriately to maintain the boundaries set by their therapist for trust restoration.\n"
