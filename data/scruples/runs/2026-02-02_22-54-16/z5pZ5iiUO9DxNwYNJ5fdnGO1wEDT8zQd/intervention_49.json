Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after setting boundaries with her husband following his affairs. They had agreed with their therapist on specific guidelines: he should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He broke the curfew, tried to make excuses with \"Jim,\" and now he's backing out of the agreement.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: She set clear boundaries based on therapy advice to rebuild trust. She communicated her expectations and was firm when he broke the agreement. His response was dismissive and he blamed her for making him late. The key here is that he violated a mutual agreement he had initially agreed to. \n\nHis excuses don't hold up. He said he wouldn't drink with women but then made an exception with \"Jim,\" which seems like a loophole. Also, being 45 minutes late undermines the agreed-upon curfew. The therapist's role was to help them establish these guidelines, so when he breaks them, it's a breach of the agreed terms.\n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in feeling angry because the trust is already broken from affairs, and his actions show a lack of commitment to fixing the marriage. Her standing her ground is a way to enforce accountability, which is crucial in such situations. She also mentions his guilt-tripping about \"Jim,\" which is manipulative. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't being unreasonable. She's following through with the therapeutic plan to rebuild trust, and her husband's non-compliance is the issue here. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
