Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an ongoing issue with the husband's infidelity and the couple's attempt to rebuild trust through therapy. They set boundaries, like the husband being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks this agreement by staying out later, even after the last women have left, and then argues about the rules.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, so the wife is trying to establish trust-building measures with the help of a therapist. The agreed-upon rules are part of the therapeutic process. When the husband violates these rules, even if it's with a friend, he's breaking the agreed terms. The wife's anger is justified because he went back on his word, which is crucial for rebuilding trust. \n\nThe husband's response\u2014that being home before 11 is \"good enough\" because he texted before 10\u2014seems dismissive of the agreed-upon time. Also, using \"Jim\" to justify his lateness might be an excuse to avoid accountability. The wife is upset because he's not taking the rules seriously, which undermines the therapy's purpose. \n\nFrom the wife's perspective, holding him accountable is necessary for the relationship's health. She's not being unreasonable; she's enforcing the boundaries they agreed on. The husband's resistance and refusal to follow through suggest he's not committed to the process, which is a bigger issue. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. The husband might feel the rules are too restrictive, but he didn't communicate that before agreeing. The wife's ultimatum about leaving if he doesn't want to fix the marriage is strong, but given the context of past affairs, it's a valid expression of her limits. \n\nOverall, the husband's actions violated their agreement without valid reason, and the wife is justified in her anger. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
