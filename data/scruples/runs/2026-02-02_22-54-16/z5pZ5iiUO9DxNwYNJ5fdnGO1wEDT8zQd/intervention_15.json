Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they've set boundaries through therapy, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the agreed-upon time, argues, and even brings up a friend named Jim to justify staying out. The author confronts him, leading to a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The couple had a clear agreement set with their therapist, which he agreed to. The author is holding him accountable, which is reasonable given the history of infidelity. The husband then breaks the rule, uses excuses, and even dismisses the agreement after being late. This could be seen as a breach of trust and not taking the necessary steps to rebuild it.\n\nThe husband's actions\u2014staying out past the agreed time, arguing about the rules, and bringing up Jim to guilt-trip the author\u2014don't seem respectful or cooperative. The author's frustration is justified because the husband isn't following through on commitments made in therapy, which is crucial for trust-building. \n\nHowever, the husband claims the 10 PM rule isn't doable anymore. But since the agreement was for a month, and he's only halfway through, his resistance might indicate a lack of commitment to the process. The author's anger stems from his broken promises and attempts to shift blame, which are valid concerns.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for the agreed terms and addressing his lack of accountability. The husband's behavior suggests he's not taking the necessary steps to mend the relationship, which makes the author's stance reasonable.\n"
