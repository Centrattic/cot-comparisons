Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband with multiple affairs and a therapy plan to rebuild trust. The couple set guidelines: he's supposed to be home by 10 and not drink with women. He agreed to these rules.\n\nSo, he went out with friends for the first time and was supposed to be home by 10. At 9:50, he texts to stay out because it's just one guy left. The author insists on him coming home on time. They argue, and she threatens to leave if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage. He comes back 45 minutes late, claims he was home before 11 and that texting before 10 is enough, and now Jim is upset. He also says the 10 PM rule isn't doable and won't follow it anymore, with only two weeks left of the agreement.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and wants to know if that's correct. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, the husband agreed to the rules in therapy. Breaking them undermines trust. The author is trying to hold him accountable as advised by the therapist. His argument that he's \"home before 11\" doesn't align with the agreed time. The fact that he used another person (Jim) to get out of the commitment could be seen as manipulative. The author's anger is justified because he violated the agreed terms. She's not being unrealistic; she's enforcing the boundaries set to rebuild trust. The therapist's guidelines are part of the healing process, so the husband's non-compliance is a problem. The user's answer should consider the husband's responsibility to follow through and the author's right to enforce agreed-upon terms. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
