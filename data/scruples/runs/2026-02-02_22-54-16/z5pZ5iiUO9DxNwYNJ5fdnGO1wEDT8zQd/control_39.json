Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their husband having multiple affairs, and they're in therapy working on rebuilding trust. They set guidelines with the therapist: husband comes home by 10 and doesn't drink with women. He agreed to it. Then he went out with guys and tried to stay out past 10, arguing with her. They fought, she threatened to leave, he came home late, and now he's saying the 10 PM rule isn't doable.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is wrong. The key points here are about trust, boundaries, and accountability. The husband has a history of infidelity, so the wife is trying to set boundaries as part of the therapy process. She's holding him accountable for the agreement they made. When he breaks the agreement, she's upset and stands her ground. \n\nIs she being unreasonable? The husband agreed to the rules initially. If he's not willing to follow through, that's on him. The wife is within her right to enforce the boundaries to rebuild trust. The husband's behavior\u2014making excuses, breaking the agreed time, and dismissing her concerns\u2014shows a lack of commitment to the agreed-upon steps. The wife's anger is justified because he violated the trust-building measures they both agreed to. She didn't force him to follow the rules against his will; he agreed to them and then broke them. Her response\u2014expressing her need for him to follow through\u2014is reasonable. The therapist's advice supports setting these guidelines, so she's acting in accordance with professional guidance. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
