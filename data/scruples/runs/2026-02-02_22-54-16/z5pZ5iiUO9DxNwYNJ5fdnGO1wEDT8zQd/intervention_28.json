Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a husband who's had multiple affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist. The main issue is the husband not following the agreed-upon rule of being home by 10 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The couple is in therapy, which is a good sign they're trying to work things out. The husband agreed to the guidelines, which include being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The author, the wife, is enforcing these rules to rebuild trust. \n\nLast night, the husband went out with friends and was supposed to be home by 10. At 9:50, he texts asking if he can stay out because only \"Jim\" is left. The wife reminds him of the agreement's importance for trust. He argues, and they fight. He ends up coming home 45 minutes late, claims he was home before 11 (but texted before 10), and now \"Jim\" is mad. The husband says the 10 PM rule isn't doable, and he's done with it.\n\nThe question is whether the wife is wrong. The user thinks she's not. Let's break it down. \n\nThe wife's actions: She set clear boundaries based on their therapist's advice. She reminded him of the agreement when he tried to break it. She felt the need to assert herself because of past infidelity, which likely made trust a big issue. Her anger stems from broken trust and a broken promise. \n\nThe husband's actions: He agreed to the rules but then tried to bend them. He broke the agreement, which could be seen as not taking the rebuilding process seriously. His argument about \"just one guy\" and the women leaving might be an excuse. Also, he's not holding up his end, which could hinder trust rebuilding. \n\nThe user is asking if the wife is in the wrong. Considering the context of infidelity and the therapeutic process, the wife's stance seems reasonable. She's trying to enforce the agreed-upon rules to rebuild trust. The husband's non-compliance is problematic here. He's not respecting the boundaries they set together, which is crucial when trying to repair the relationship. \n\nThe fight escalating to the point where she threatens to return home shows the severity of the situation. His response that he won't follow the rule anymore might indicate a lack of commitment to the agreed-upon steps. The wife's anger is justified given the history and the importance of following through on commitments in such situations. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the wife isn't in the wrong. She's upholding the boundaries necessary for healing. The husband's actions are the ones that breach the trust. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
