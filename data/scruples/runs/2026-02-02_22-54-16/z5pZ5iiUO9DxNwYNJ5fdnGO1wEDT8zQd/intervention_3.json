Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wife who's dealing with her husband's infidelity and setting some boundaries through therapy. The husband agreed to come home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He broke that agreement by staying out past the agreed time, even though there were no women left, and then argued about it. The wife ended up in a big fight and told him she might leave if he doesn't fix things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has had multiple affairs, which is a big deal. The therapist suggested accountability measures, which both parties agreed to. The husband agreed to be home by 10, but when he was about to be late, he tried to negotiate staying out with just one friend, Jim. The wife stood her ground, emphasizing the importance of trust. The husband then came home late, argued that being home before 11 was good enough, and even blamed Jim for the problem.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and accountability. The husband violated the agreed-upon rule, even though there were no women present, which might suggest he's not taking the rules seriously. The wife is trying to enforce the boundaries as part of rebuilding trust. Her anger stems from his dishonesty and breaking his word. She also called his bluff by saying she might leave if he doesn't commit to fixing the marriage, which is a significant step in a situation with repeated infidelity.\n\nIs the wife being too strict? Well, the rules were set with the therapist's guidance, so they're part of a structured plan. The husband's actions show a lack of commitment to following through, which is crucial for rebuilding trust. The wife's response is about holding him accountable, which is necessary. He's even trying to shift blame to Jim, which is a red flag. The wife isn't being unrealistic; she's enforcing the agreed terms. The husband's behavior here suggests he's not taking the process seriously, which is problematic.\n\nSo, considering the context, the wife is in the right. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
