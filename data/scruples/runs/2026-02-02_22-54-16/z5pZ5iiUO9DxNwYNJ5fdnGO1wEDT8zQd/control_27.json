Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's husband has had multiple affairs. They went to therapy, and the therapist suggested some guidelines to rebuild trust. The guidelines included the husband being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms.\n\nNow, the husband goes out with friends and texts the author at 9:50 PM saying he wants to stay out because it's just him and a friend named Jim. The author insists he come home by 10, but the husband argues, leading to a big fight. He ends up coming home 45 minutes late, says he was home before 11, and even claims that Jim is mad at the author. The husband also states that the 10 PM rule isn't doable anymore, even though they had agreed to follow it for a month.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their agreement. The therapist's advice was part of a structured plan to rebuild trust after multiple affairs. The husband agreed to these guidelines, so breaking them could undermine the therapy's effectiveness. The author is trying to hold him accountable, which seems reasonable given their history.\n\nThe husband's actions here are a breach of the agreed-upon rules. He went out with friends and then tried to make an exception when it was just him and a man (Jim), which contradicts the rule about not being with women. The author is concerned about trust, and this incident could be a trigger for her anxiety. His response, arguing and even trying to use Jim as a reason to stay out, might be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the agreed terms.\n\nThe husband's argument that 10 PM isn't doable anymore after agreeing to it for a month seems like a step back. The author's anger is justified because he broke the terms they both agreed on. Also, the fact that he came home late and then tried to justify it by saying he was home before 11 and that Jim is mad at her adds to the conflict. His behavior might be seen as not taking the agreed rules seriously, which is crucial in rebuilding trust after infidelity.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that the rules are too restrictive, especially if he's spending time with friends. However, since they had a specific agreement with their therapist, his refusal to adhere to it could indicate a lack of commitment to fixing the marriage. The author's insistence on him following through is part of the therapeutic process, so she's not being unreasonable.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is within her rights to be upset when the husband breaks the terms they set. Trust is fragile after affairs, and every action matters. The husband's actions here could be seen as a betrayal of the trust-building process. The author is not being unrealistic; she's holding him accountable as agreed. Therefore, the answer is likely B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
