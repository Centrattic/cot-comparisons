Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs who agreed to specific guidelines with his wife and therapist. The main issue here is that the husband broke the agreed-upon rule (being home by 10 PM) and then got defensive, even using a friend named Jim as an excuse. The wife is upset because he's not following through on his commitment, which they were using to rebuild trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had a structured plan from their therapist to rebuild trust after multiple infidelities. The husband agreed to these terms, which included a curfew. When he violated that curfew, the wife stood by the agreement, while he tried to justify it and later refused to follow the rule anymore. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I should evaluate that. The key points here are: the husband's history of affairs, the agreed-upon boundaries, his violation of those boundaries, and his defensiveness. Trust is crucial in a marriage, especially after infidelity. The wife's frustration is understandable because the husband isn't respecting the agreed terms, which are meant to help rebuild trust. \n\nThe husband's argument that \"it's just one guy\" and that he's not going to follow the curfew anymore seems dismissive. Using the friend Jim to justify his actions might be a way to deflect responsibility. The wife's reaction\u2014expressing anger and even threatening to leave\u2014shows her desperation and the importance she places on the agreement. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wife is within her rights to hold the husband accountable. The husband agreed to the rules, and breaking them undermines the trust-building process. The wife isn't being unrealistic; she's enforcing boundaries that they both committed to in therapy. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
