Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who has had multiple affairs and agreed to certain guidelines with his wife and their therapist to rebuild trust. The guidelines include being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks these rules by staying out past 10, even though he initially agreed to them. The wife confronts him, they argue, and he later claims that being home by 10 isn't doable and won't follow the rule anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the wife overstepped. The guidelines were set in therapy, which suggests they were part of a mutual agreement to address the husband's infidelity. The husband agreed to these terms, so when he breaks them, the wife is within her rights to hold him accountable. Her actions are part of the process their therapist recommended. The husband's argument that he can't follow the rules anymore undermines the agreement they made. The wife's anger stems from betrayal and the need for trust, which is crucial after infidelity. The husband's behavior, including breaking the agreed-upon rules and then blaming \"Jim\" to make her feel guilty, seems manipulative and dismissive of her feelings. \n\nThe key points here are: mutual agreement in therapy, the husband breaking the agreement, the wife holding him accountable, and the husband's subsequent defensiveness. The wife isn't being unrealistic; she's enforcing boundaries necessary for healing. The husband's refusal to follow through on his commitments would likely hinder trust rebuilding. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
