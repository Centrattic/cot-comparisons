Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home as agreed. The husband had a history of affairs and they set boundaries with their therapist. The agreement was he comes home by 10 PM and doesn't drink with women. He broke that by staying out past the agreed time and didn't drink with women as he claimed.\n\nFirst, the therapist's guidelines were part of rebuilding trust. The husband agreed to them, so breaking them would be a breach of the agreement. The author stood by the rules they set together, which makes sense because consistency is key in trust rebuilding. \n\nThe husband is now arguing and trying to justify breaking the rules by saying it's just one guy and that he's home before 11, which isn't the same as 10 PM. Also, he's trying to make her feel guilty by mentioning \"Jim\" being mad. That seems manipulative. \n\nThe author's anger is justified because the husband broke the agreed terms. She's trying to hold him accountable, which is necessary when there's a history of infidelity. The husband's resistance and excuses could indicate he's not fully committed to fixing the marriage, which is a valid concern for the author.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's upholding the agreed-upon boundaries to rebuild trust. The husband is the one not following through. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
