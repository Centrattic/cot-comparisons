Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who has had multiple affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist. The key points here are the agreed-upon rules: being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the first rule by staying out past 10, even after promising to follow the guidelines. The wife is upset and confronts him, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their situation. They're in therapy, and the husband has a history of infidelity. The therapist's advice is that he needs to be held accountable, so the rules are part of rebuilding trust. The husband agreed to these terms. When he breaks them, the wife is within her right to be upset. She's not just being nitpicky; this is part of a structured plan to address deeper issues in the marriage.\n\nThe husband's behavior here is a breach of trust. He's not following through on his commitment, which is crucial in a situation where trust is already broken. The fact that he tries to justify his actions and even accuses the wife of making someone else (Jim) mad adds to the problem. He's not taking responsibility for his actions, which is a red flag. The wife's anger is valid because she's trying to maintain the boundaries necessary for healing the relationship.\n\nSome might argue that being home by 10 is strict, but given the context of affairs and the need for accountability, it's a reasonable condition set by the therapist. The husband's refusal to follow it undermines the entire process. The wife is not being unrealistic; she's holding him to the agreement they made. So, the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
