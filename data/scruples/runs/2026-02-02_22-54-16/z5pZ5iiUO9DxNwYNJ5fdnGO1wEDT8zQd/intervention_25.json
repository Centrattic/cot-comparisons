Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a husband with a history of affairs, and they've set up guidelines in therapy, including being home by 10 PM. The husband breaks this agreement by staying out past the time, and then gets defensive and argumentative. The author argues with him, even threatening to leave, which leads to a fight. The husband later says he won't follow the rule anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The guidelines were agreed upon in therapy, which suggests they are part of a structured plan to rebuild trust. The husband agreed to them, so breaking the agreement is a breach of trust. The author is enforcing the boundary they set, which is reasonable. The husband's response\u2014arguing, getting defensive, and dismissing the importance of the rule\u2014shows a lack of accountability, which is a red flag in a relationship, especially after infidelity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for enforcing the boundary. Boundaries are crucial in rebuilding trust, especially after affairs. The author's anger is justified because the husband is not holding up his end of the agreement. The husband's attempt to use \"Jim\" as an excuse might be a manipulation tactic to avoid responsibility. The author's threat to return home could indicate desperation or a need for the husband to take the situation seriously, but it's a heavy move. However, given the context of multiple affairs and the husband's resistance to accountability, the author's actions are a response to a pattern of behavior that's harmful to the marriage.\n\nConsidering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to maintain the agreed-upon structure to rebuild trust, and the husband's reactions show he's not fully committed to the process. So the answer should be B.\n"
