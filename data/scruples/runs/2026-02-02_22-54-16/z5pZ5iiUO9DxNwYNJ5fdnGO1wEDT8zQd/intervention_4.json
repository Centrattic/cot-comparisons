Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a husband who's had affairs and agreed to certain guidelines with their therapist, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband breaks the agreement by staying out past 10, uses a friend \"Jim\" as an excuse, and then dismisses the wife's concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is working with a therapist to rebuild trust after infidelity. The guidelines were set as part of the therapy process, and the husband agreed to them. The wife is enforcing the agreed-upon rules, which is part of the plan to rebuild trust. The husband's actions here\u2014breaking the agreed time, making excuses, and trying to guilt-trip his wife\u2014seem to undermine the trust-building process. \n\nThe wife's anger is justified because he violated the terms they both agreed to. She's trying to hold him accountable, which is necessary after cheating. The husband's reaction, dismissing her concerns and blaming the friend Jim, shows a lack of accountability. \n\nIs she being too strict? Maybe not. Trust is hard to rebuild, and such rules are common in post-infidelity therapy. The husband's refusal to follow the guidelines suggests he might not be committed to fixing the marriage, which the therapist mentioned earlier. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's upholding an agreement they made, and her frustration is valid given his history. The husband's behavior is problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
