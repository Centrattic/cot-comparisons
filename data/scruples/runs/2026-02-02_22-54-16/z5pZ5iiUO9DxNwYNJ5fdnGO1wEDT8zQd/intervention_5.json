Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her husband to come home on time because of his past affairs. They had an agreement with their therapist to set guidelines, like being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband broke the agreement, tried to make excuses with \"Jim,\" and now he's arguing that it's not doable.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the agreed-upon rules from therapy. The husband initially agreed to these, so breaking them shows he's not following through on his commitments. The author is trying to rebuild trust, which is crucial after infidelity. His excuses, like \"just one guy\" and \"women are gone,\" don't hold up because he had already agreed to the guidelines. Plus, he's using another person (Jim) to guilt-trip her, which is manipulative.\n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014arguing, whining, and not taking the rules seriously\u2014suggests he's not committed to rebuilding the marriage as he should be. The author is standing her ground, which is necessary for her own healing and trust. She's not being unrealistic; she's holding him accountable. The therapist's advice was clear, so the author is following the recommended steps.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's acting in a way that's reasonable given the circumstances. The husband is the one not adhering to the agreed terms and trying to deflect blame. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
