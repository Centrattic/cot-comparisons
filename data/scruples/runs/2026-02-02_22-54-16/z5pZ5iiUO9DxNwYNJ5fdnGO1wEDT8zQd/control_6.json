Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband having multiple affairs, and the couple's therapist setting guidelines for him to rebuild trust. The specific rule was to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. The husband agreed but then broke the rule by staying out past 10, even though he had initially been okay with it. He tried to justify it by saying he was with a guy, Jim, and that all the women had left. The author felt justified in being angry because he broke his word, and the husband is now upset with her for making him feel guilty using Jim's situation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The husband has a history of affairs, which is a serious issue in their marriage. The therapist recommended guidelines, which the husband agreed to. The rule about being home by 10 PM was a condition set to rebuild trust. The husband then went out with the guys and asked to stay out, despite the agreement. The author is upset because he didn't adhere to the agreed time, even if the situation changed. The husband is now arguing that the rule isn't doable and refusing to follow it for the remaining two weeks.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for enforcing the rule. Let's break it down. The husband agreed to the guidelines, including the curfew. Breaking the curfew without a valid reason (and even if he had a reason, he didn't communicate it effectively beforehand) would be a violation. The author is within her rights to hold him accountable since they set these terms together in therapy. The use of \"Jim\" as a justification might be a red herring if the actual rule was about time, not the company. Also, his reaction to the author's insistence might indicate a lack of commitment to the agreed-upon steps for rebuilding trust.\n\nThe husband's behavior here shows a pattern of not following through on commitments, which is a problem in the context of infidelity. The author is trying to maintain the boundaries set for trust rebuilding, so her anger is understandable. The therapist's advice is that accountability is necessary, and the husband's refusal to comply could undermine that process. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The husband might have had a legitimate reason that wasn't communicated earlier, or maybe the rule was too strict. However, the post states that he agreed to the terms initially and then changed his mind, which suggests he's not respecting the agreed boundaries. The author isn't being unrealistic if the therapist recommended these steps. The husband's defiance and the guilt-tripping about Jim seem like attempts to shift responsibility away from his actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing the rule they set together, especially given the husband's history. His non-compliance and the subsequent behavior (arguing, whining, guilt-tripping) likely indicate a lack of commitment to the marriage and the therapeutic process. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
