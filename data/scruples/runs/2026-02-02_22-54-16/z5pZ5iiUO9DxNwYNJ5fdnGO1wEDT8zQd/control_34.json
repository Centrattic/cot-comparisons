Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they had agreed on guidelines during therapy, including being home by 10 PM. The husband broke that rule, tried to make an exception with a friend, and now there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, which is a major issue. The guidelines were set in therapy to rebuild trust. The author, the wife, is enforcing the agreed-upon rules. The husband didn't follow through, then argued about it and even tried to shift blame by saying \"Jim\" is mad. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. From the details, she followed through on the therapist's advice, held the husband accountable when he broke the rules, and stood her ground despite his resistance. He, on the other hand, violated the agreement and is being dismissive or resistant to accountability. That seems unfair. The wife's actions are in line with the therapeutic process, which emphasizes accountability for the cheating partner. The husband's refusal to comply and his defensive behavior likely exacerbate the situation. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's trying to rebuild trust as advised by a professional, and the husband is the one not adhering to the agreed terms. The guilt-tripping and excuse-making from the husband are red flags that the wife is justified in being upset. There's no indication that her expectations are unreasonable given the circumstances.\n"
