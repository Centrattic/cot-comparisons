Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe husband has had multiple affairs, which is a big deal. They've been to therapy, and the therapist suggested that the husband needs to be accountable and that they should set guidelines to rebuild trust. The specific guidelines they came up with are that he should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. The husband agreed to these terms. \n\nThen, the husband goes out with friends for the first time. He texts the author at 9:50, saying he's with Jim and asks if he can stay out. The author tells him that coming home on time is important for rebuilding trust. The husband argues, saying it's just one guy and the women have left, so he should be allowed to stay. They end up in a big fight, where the author threatens to leave, and the husband comes home 45 minutes late. He then tells her that being home by 10 isn't doable anymore and that Jim is mad at her.\n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong for enforcing the agreed-upon rules and getting upset about the husband breaking them.\n\nFirst, looking at the husband's actions: he agreed to the guidelines in therapy, which is a formal setting where both parties are working on the relationship. Breaking those guidelines immediately after agreeing to them seems like a problem. The husband is being uncooperative and not following through on his commitments, which the therapist recommended as part of rebuilding trust. His excuses (it's just one guy, women are gone) don't seem valid if the agreement was to not drink with women and be home by 10. Even if women are gone, the presence of Jim and other friends might still be an issue if the husband is out late, but the main rule here is about curfew and not drinking with women. However, the husband is now saying he can't follow the curfew, which is part of the agreement.\n\nThe author is standing by the agreement they made in therapy. She's trying to hold him accountable, which is exactly what the therapist suggested. When the husband breaks the agreement and tries to justify it, she's upset because he's not following through. The fact that he came home late and then blamed her for Jim's anger adds to the problem. He's dismissing the agreed terms and not taking her concerns seriously.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the husband agreed to the guidelines, then violated them. The author is enforcing the rules to rebuild trust. The husband is being non-compliant and argumentative. The author's anger is a reaction to his dishonesty and breaking commitments. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, accountability is crucial after infidelity. The husband's behavior suggests he's not putting in the effort to rebuild trust, which is a red flag. The author's stance seems reasonable given the circumstances. She's not being unrealistic; she's following the therapist's advice and holding him to the agreement they made. The husband's resistance to the rules and his excuses undermine the process.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking the necessary steps to protect the relationship and hold her husband accountable. The husband's actions are the problem here, not the author's response.\n"
