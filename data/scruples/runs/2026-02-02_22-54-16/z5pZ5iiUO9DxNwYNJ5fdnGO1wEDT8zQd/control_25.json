Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home by 10 PM as part of a therapy-recommended plan to rebuild trust after multiple affairs.\n\nFirst, the context: The husband had affairs, and therapy suggested accountability measures. They agreed on a one-month plan including being home by 10 and not drinking with women. The husband agreed. Then, he went out, wanted to stay out with a guy named Jim, came home 45 minutes late, and argued that the curfew wasn't doable anymore. He also mentioned that Jim was mad at the author for enforcing the curfew.\n\nThe author is upset because he broke the agreed rules, didn't follow through, used Jim as an excuse, and then dismissed her concerns. The key points here are trust-building, agreed-upon boundaries, and the husband's follow-through.\n\nFrom a standpoint of accountability, the husband agreed to these terms in therapy, which is a neutral setting. Breaking those agreements undermines the trust he's supposed to rebuild. The author is enforcing what was mutually agreed upon, which is reasonable. His argument that \"it's just one guy\" and that he can't stick to the curfew anymore seems like a breach of the agreement. The fact that he's dismissing the rules now, especially with only two weeks left, might indicate a lack of commitment to the process.\n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014arguing, whining, and then blaming Jim\u2014could be seen as deflecting responsibility. The author's anger is justified because the trust is fragile, and the husband's actions are not helping. She's trying to hold him accountable, which is what the therapist recommended. So, the author isn't being unrealistic; she's upholding the agreement they made for the sake of their marriage.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
