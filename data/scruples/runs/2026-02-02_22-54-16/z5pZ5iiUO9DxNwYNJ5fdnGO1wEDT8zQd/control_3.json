Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband having multiple affairs and a therapy-guided agreement to follow certain guidelines to rebuild trust. The main issue here is that the husband broke the agreed-upon rule of being home by 10 PM, and the author confronted him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their therapy. The therapist suggested setting boundaries, which the husband initially agreed to. The author is following through on that advice by holding him accountable. The husband then breaks the rule, claims he's home by 11, and blames \"Jim,\" which seems like a weak excuse. The author feels justified in being angry because he broke his word and tried to shift blame.\n\nI should think about whether the author's expectations are reasonable. The agreement was part of a trust-building process after infidelity, so strict adherence would be important. The husband's defiance could undermine the whole process. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after multiple affairs. The therapist's role here is crucial; if the guidelines were set in therapy, the author is acting in line with professional advice.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction\u2014arguing and not following the rules\u2014doesn't show commitment to rebuilding trust. The author's threat to leave if he doesn't want to fix the marriage is a strong stance, but it's a valid response given the circumstances. The husband's insistence on not following the rules might indicate a lack of willingness to change, which is a problem in the relationship.\n\nIs the author being unrealistic? Maybe not. After affairs, trust is hard to rebuild, and clear boundaries are necessary. The husband's actions show he's not respecting those boundaries, which the author has every right to be upset about. The use of \"Jim\" as an excuse also seems like a manipulation tactic, which the author rightly calls out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's following through on a therapist's advice, holding her husband accountable, and expressing her anger because he broke their agreement. The husband's behavior is the issue here, not the author's response.\n"
