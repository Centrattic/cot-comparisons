Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who agreed to certain terms set by the couple's therapist to rebuild trust after multiple affairs. The wife asked him to come home by 10 PM, but he stayed out later, argued with her, and even tried to use his friend Jim as an excuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of affairs, and the therapist suggested guidelines to rebuild trust. The wife set a specific rule (home by 10, no drinking with women) and the husband initially agreed. When he broke the rule, she stood her ground, leading to a fight. He then dismissed her concerns and continued to push back on the rule.\n\nIs the wife being unreasonable? Well, given the circumstances, trust is a major issue. The husband's actions (affairs) have caused significant damage, so the wife's need for accountability is understandable. The therapist's guidelines were part of the agreed-upon steps to rebuild that trust. By breaking the agreement, the husband is undermining the process. The wife's anger is a response to his lack of accountability, which is central to her feeling secure in the relationship.\n\nThe husband's defense\u2014that it's just one guy, and women left\u2014doesn't hold weight if he agreed to the terms. Also, his argument that 10 PM isn't doable now, especially with only two weeks left, seems like he's not fully committed to the process. Using Jim as a reason to stay out and then blaming the wife for Jim being mad is manipulative and dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe wife's response\u2014telling him she'll go back to her family if he doesn't want to fix the marriage\u2014shows her frustration and the seriousness of the issue. It's a valid emotional reaction given the stakes.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's enforcing a boundary that was part of their agreed-upon plan. The husband's actions and arguments suggest he's not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust, which is his responsibility. The wife's stance is about holding him accountable, which is crucial after infidelity. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
