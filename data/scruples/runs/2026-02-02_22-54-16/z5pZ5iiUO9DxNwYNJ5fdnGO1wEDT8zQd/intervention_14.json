Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who agreed to certain boundaries in therapy to rebuild trust after multiple affairs. The couple set a guideline that he should be home by 10 PM for a month. He went out with friends, asked to stay out past 10 with one friend named Jim, and broke the agreement. The author (the wife) asked him to come home, they fought, and he later refused to follow the rule anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband agreed to the rules in therapy, so breaking them could be seen as a violation of trust. The wife is trying to enforce the boundaries they set together. He then tried to use Jim as an excuse and even said the cutoff time isn't doable. The author is upset because he went back on his word and used Jim to guilt-trip her. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). From the perspective of the situation, the wife is holding her husband accountable for his agreements. The husband's actions (breaking the agreed-upon rules and not respecting the boundaries) seem to be the issue here. The wife's reaction is about maintaining trust and following through on their therapy plan. The husband's refusal to adhere to the rules could undermine the therapy's effectiveness. \n\nPossible arguments against the wife: Maybe she's being too strict, especially if he's late only once. But given the context of multiple affairs and the need for trust-building, strict adherence is crucial. Also, he had agreed to the rules, so breaking them is a problem. The wife's anger is justified because he's not following through on his commitment. The husband's response about Jim being mad and not wanting to follow the rules anymore shows a lack of accountability.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband is the one breaking the agreement, and the wife is trying to hold him accountable. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
