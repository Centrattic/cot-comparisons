Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's husband has had multiple affairs. They're in therapy, and the therapist said he needs to be held accountable and set guidelines. They agreed on a month where he should be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He agreed to this. Then he went out with friends, told her he'd be home by 10, but at 9:50, he texts asking if he can stay out because there's just one guy left (Jim). The author tells him that coming home on time is important for trust. They fight, she says if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, she'll leave. He comes home 45 minutes late, says he was home before 11 and that he doesn't think 10 PM is doable anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of the agreement.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for expecting her husband to follow through on their agreed-upon guidelines. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband had agreed to the rules in therapy. Breaking that agreement could be seen as not taking the process seriously. The author is trying to rebuild trust, which is understandable after multiple affairs. She's enforcing the agreed-upon boundaries, which is reasonable. The husband is not following through, even after the author explains why it's important. He also seems to be making excuses (like Jim being there) and even feels it's okay to come home later once the deadline is missed. Plus, he's dismissing her feelings and using Jim as a reason to guilt-trip her.\n\nThe therapist's role was to help them set these guidelines, so the husband's refusal to follow them could hinder their progress. The author is standing her ground, which is necessary for her own emotional well-being. She's not being unreasonable; she's holding him to the standards they mutually agreed on. His arguments about the time being \"not doable\" might be a way to avoid accountability.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband is feeling restricted and is frustrated. But that's part of the accountability process after infidelity. The author is not the one breaking the agreement. She's the one enforcing it, which is a positive step. The husband's reaction\u2014arguing, whining, and then refusing to follow the rules\u2014suggests he's not committed to fixing the marriage. The author's anger is justified because he went back on his word and tried to manipulate the situation with Jim's presence.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. She's taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust as advised by their therapist. The husband's actions are the ones that are problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
