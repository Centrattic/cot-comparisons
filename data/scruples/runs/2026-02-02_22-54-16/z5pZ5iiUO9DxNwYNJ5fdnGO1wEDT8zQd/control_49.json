Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home as per their agreed guidelines after he had multiple affairs. \n\nFirst, the husband had cheated multiple times, and they've been in therapy. The therapist recommended setting guidelines, like being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms. Then, when he went out with friends and tried to stay out past 10, the wife insisted he come home. He argued, and they fought. The wife then threatened to leave if he didn't commit to fixing the marriage. He came home late, was defensive, and now he's refusing to follow the guidelines.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the agreement was made in therapy, both parties agreed to the terms, and the husband broke them. The wife is holding him accountable, which is part of the therapy's recommendation. The husband's behavior\u2014making excuses, trying to guilt-trip her with \"Jim\" being mad, and refusing to follow the agreed-upon rules\u2014seems like he's not taking the necessary steps to rebuild trust. \n\nThe wife's actions seem justified because she's following through on the therapeutic plan they set together. The husband's non-compliance and defensiveness are the main issues here. The wife isn't being unrealistic; she's adhering to the guidelines they both agreed upon. Her anger is a valid response to his breaking the agreement and not taking her trust seriously. The husband's refusal to follow the rules undermines the entire process. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for the boundaries and commitments they made to rebuild their marriage. The husband's actions are the problem, not her holding him accountable.\n"
