Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who's had multiple affairs, and the couple set guidelines in therapy to rebuild trust. The rules were for the husband to be home by 10 and not drink with women. He went out with friends, told the wife he'd be home by 10, but then called to stay out when it was just him and another guy named Jim. The wife stood by the agreement, they fought, and he ended up coming home 45 minutes late. He argues that texting her before 10 is good enough and now Jim is mad at her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The husband has a history of affairs, which is a serious issue. The therapist's advice was to set guidelines for accountability, which the husband agreed to. The specific rule was to be home by 10 and avoid drinking with women. The wife, following the agreed-upon plan, expects him to stick to it. However, when he calls to stay out because it's just \"Jim\" now, he's essentially breaking the agreement. \n\nThe user is asking if the wife is wrong for enforcing the rules. The options are A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nI think the main issue is about the husband breaking the agreed terms. The wife is trying to rebuild trust by holding him accountable, which the therapist suggested. He initially agreed but then made excuses when the situation changed. The wife's reaction, telling him that not following through would hinder the marriage's recovery, seems reasonable. He then comes home late and tries to justify it, even though he broke the agreement. \n\nThe husband's argument that Jim is now mad at her because of the text might be a red herring. The main problem is his dishonesty and breaking the agreed-upon rules. The wife isn't being unreasonable; she's following the steps outlined in therapy. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's upholding the commitments they made in therapy, and the husband is the one violating the terms, not her.\n"
