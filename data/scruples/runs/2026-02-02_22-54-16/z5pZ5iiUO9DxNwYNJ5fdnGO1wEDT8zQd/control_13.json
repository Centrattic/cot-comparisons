Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after telling her husband to come home on time and getting into a fight when he didn't.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband has had multiple affairs, and they've been working with a therapist. They set guidelines: he needs to be home by 10 and not drink with women. He agreed to these terms. Then, when he went out with his friends, he was supposed to be home by 10 but asked to stay out when only his friend Jim was left. The wife made it clear that sticking to the agreed time is important for rebuilding trust. He argued and eventually came home 45 minutes late, then dismissed her concerns by saying he was home before 11 and Jim was mad at her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the husband agreed to the rules, broke them, and then tried to justify it. The wife is upset because he's not following through on his commitment, which was part of the therapy plan to rebuild trust. Trust is crucial after affairs, so the wife's insistence on adherence makes sense. The husband's behavior of breaking the rules and then minimizing it (saying 10 isn't doable anymore) seems dismissive and could undermine the progress they were making. Also, using his friend Jim as a reason to stay out might be an excuse to avoid accountability. \n\nThe wife's reaction of anger is understandable given the circumstances. She's in a vulnerable position after multiple infidelities, and consistent behavior is necessary to rebuild trust. The therapist's guidelines are part of a structured approach, so going against them without discussion could be seen as a step back. The husband's refusal to comply with the agreed terms without a valid reason (and using an excuse) is problematic. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's holding her husband accountable, which is necessary in this context. The answer should be B.\n"
