Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home as agreed. The husband has a history of affairs, and their therapist set up a one-month guideline where he's supposed to be home by 10 and avoid drinking with women. \n\nThe husband went out with friends, promised to come home by 10, but at 9:50, he texts to ask if he can stay out because only one guy, Jim, is left. The wife insists on him following the agreement to rebuild trust. He argues, they fight, and he ends up coming home 45 minutes late, then gets defensive and tells her Jim is mad at her. He also says the 10 PM rule isn't doable anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here: the rules were agreed upon in therapy to help rebuild trust after multiple affairs. The husband broke the agreement, even though he initially agreed. The wife is holding him accountable, which seems reasonable given the context. The husband is not taking the rules seriously and is trying to justify his actions, which could undermine the trust-building process.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). The husband's actions are the problem here\u2014he broke the agreed terms. The wife is just enforcing the boundaries they set, which makes sense, especially after infidelity. The husband's defensiveness and trying to shift blame onto Jim might indicate a lack of accountability, which is part of the issue. The therapist's guidelines are part of the process, so the wife is right to push for adherence. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
