Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband with multiple affairs, and they've set up guidelines with their therapist. The guidelines include being home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband broke the guideline by staying out past 10, then tried to use \"Jim\" as an excuse and got defensive. The wife got angry, telling him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, she'll leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband has a history of infidelity, which is a serious issue. The couple is in therapy, and they've agreed on these guidelines as part of rebuilding trust. The husband agreed to these rules, so breaking them would be a problem. The wife is trying to enforce the agreed-upon boundaries, which is a reasonable step in such a situation.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The husband agreed to the guidelines, 2) He broke them, 3) He tried to justify it by mentioning another person (\"Jim\") and downplaying the rules, 4) He didn't take the agreement seriously and now is not willing to follow the guidelines anymore. \n\nThe wife's reaction is based on the need for trust rebuilding. She's holding him accountable, which is what the therapist suggested. His response seems dismissive and not taking the agreed terms seriously. The fact that he's only following the rules for the remaining 2 weeks might indicate a lack of commitment, which is concerning.\n\nThe question is whether the wife is in the wrong. From a standpoint of accountability and rebuilding trust, her actions make sense. She's trying to enforce the boundaries they set in therapy. His behavior undermines that process. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
