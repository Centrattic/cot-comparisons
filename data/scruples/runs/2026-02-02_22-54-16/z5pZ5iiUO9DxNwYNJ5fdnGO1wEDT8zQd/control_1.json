Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband had multiple affairs, and they're in therapy. The therapist suggested setting some guidelines to rebuild trust. They agreed on a one-month plan where he needs to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. He agreed to these terms.\n\nThen, when he goes out with his friends, he texts her at 9:50 saying he wants to stay out because it's just him and \"Jim\". The author asks him to come home as per their agreement, but he argues and they fight. She threatens to leave, he comes home 45 minutes late, and then he says the time isn't doable anymore and won't follow it. He also mentions that \"Jim\" is mad at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was right to enforce the agreed-upon rules. They had set these guidelines with the therapist, and he had agreed to them. The author is trying to hold him accountable, which seems reasonable given the history of affairs. The husband then breaks the agreement by staying out late and trying to make excuses. The author's anger is justified because he went back on his word. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance here. Did the author overreact by threatening to leave? But given the context of rebuilding trust after multiple affairs, that threat might be part of her trying to set boundaries. The husband's response is dismissive and undermines the agreement, which is problematic. He's not following through, which is the core issue. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing the rules they both agreed to, even if there's a disagreement on how strict they should be. \n\nAlso, the husband using \"Jim\" as an excuse and getting other people involved might be a red flag. The author's actions were about maintaining the trust and the agreed terms, which is necessary in such a situation. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
