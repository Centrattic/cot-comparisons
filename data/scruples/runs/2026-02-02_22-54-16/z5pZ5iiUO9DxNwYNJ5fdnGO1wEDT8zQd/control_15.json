Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple dealing with the husband's affairs. The wife and husband went to therapy and set some guidelines, like the husband coming home by 10 PM and not drinking with women. The husband agreed to these terms.\n\nThen, when he went out with friends, he texted her saying he wants to stay out because his friend Jim is there. The wife insists he come home on time, leading to an argument. The husband ends up coming home 45 minutes late, claims he was home before 11, and now Jim is mad. The wife is upset because he went back on his word and used Jim as an excuse.\n\nFirst, the key points are the agreed-upon rules from therapy. The husband agreed to follow them, but he didn't. The wife is trying to enforce the boundaries set to rebuild trust. The husband's behavior (staying out late, breaking the agreement) is a problem here. He's not respecting the agreed terms, which were part of the therapy's plan to rebuild trust. His argument about Jim seems like a way to avoid accountability. The wife is justified in being upset because he broke the agreement and is not taking the necessary steps to repair the relationship. The husband's refusal to follow the guidelines undermines the therapy's purpose. The wife isn't being unrealistic; she's holding him accountable as advised by their therapist. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
