Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling her husband to come home by 10 PM as agreed, after his affairs. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been to therapy, set guidelines with the therapist's help. The husband agreed to be home by 10 and not drink with women. He broke the agreement, tried to negotiate staying out later, and dismissed the rules. The author stood her ground, leading to a fight where she threatened to leave if he didn't commit to fixing the marriage.\n\nSo the key points are: The guidelines were agreed upon in therapy, a place where both are supposed to work on the relationship. The husband agreed to them but then broke them, making excuses. The author is enforcing the boundaries they set, which is reasonable given his past behavior. She's also holding him accountable, which is important for trust-building. His response (whining, blaming the other person, dismissing the rules) shows a lack of commitment to the agreement.\n\nIs she being too strict? The rules were part of a structured plan from a therapist, so following through is part of the process. Being late by 45 minutes after promising undermines the trust-building process. The husband not following through on his commitments is a bigger issue here. The author's anger and setting a boundary by threatening to return home if he doesn't want to fix things makes sense as a response to his continued irresponsibility.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the time limit is too restrictive. But given the history of affairs, specific rules like this are common in such cases to help rebuild trust. The husband's refusal to follow even agreed-upon terms shows he's not taking the necessary steps. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. She's holding him accountable, which is necessary for the relationship's health. Answer B.\n"
