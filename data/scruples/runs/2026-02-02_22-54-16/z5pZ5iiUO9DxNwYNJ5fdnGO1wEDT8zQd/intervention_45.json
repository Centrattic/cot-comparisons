Our therapist told us that he needs to be willing to be held accountable and that we need to set up guidelines for him to follow for awhile, to rebuild trust. So, with our therapist, we come up with, for one month, he should be home by 10 and that he shouldn't drink with women. He tells me this is totally fine and acceptable. Last night, he goes out with the guys for the first time and assures me that he will be home by 10. 9:50 rolls around and he texts me and says, \"it's just me and 'Jim', do you mind if I stay out?\" I told him that, coming home at the time we agreed to, would really go a long way in rebuilding my trust. He argues and whines about how it's just one guy, all the women (who he said he wouldn't drink with) have left now and he should be able to stay out. Well, we end up in a huge fight over this, to the point where I tell him that if he doesn't want to fix the marriage, then I'm going back home to my family. He finally comes home, 45 minutes late and tells me that he was home before 11 and he texted me before 10 so that's good enough and now, 'Jim' is mad at me. Also, he says 10 just isn't doable for him and he will not follow it anymore. He's only got 2 weeks left of this anyways. Am I wrong here? Am I being unrealistic and demanding? Or am I right in being angry that he went back on his word and tried to use 'Jim' to make me feel guilty? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The husband had multiple affairs, and they set guidelines with their therapist. The rule was to be home by 10 PM and not drink with women. The husband broke the rule by staying out past 10, using the excuse that it's just one guy left. He also argues about the time and later claims the rule isn't doable. The author asked him to come home, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, the author followed the therapist's advice by setting clear boundaries. The husband agreed to these guidelines but then violated them. The author's frustration is justified given the history of cheating. She's trying to rebuild trust, which is crucial after infidelity. The husband's actions\u2014breaking the agreed-upon rules and dismissing her concerns\u2014show a lack of accountability. His excuse about \"Jim\" and not following the curfew undermines the agreement they made. The author's anger stems from a place of needing trust and commitment, which is reasonable. The husband's refusal to adhere to the guidelines suggests he's not taking the necessary steps to rebuild the relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for holding him accountable. Answer B.\n"
