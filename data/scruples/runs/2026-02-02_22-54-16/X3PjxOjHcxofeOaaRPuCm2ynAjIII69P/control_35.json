HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who is now struggling. The context is important here. The author was bullied in high school by this woman, and now she's a single mom with two kids, working as a waitress and struggling. They met at a club, and the author, while drunk, started bragging about their success, making comments about her situation, and even said they weren't sorry for her suffering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author had a bad experience in the past with this person. It's natural to feel some resentment or a desire to assert their current success. But the key here is how they expressed it. Bragging, especially when the person is already in a vulnerable situation, can be seen as cruel. Even if the author justifies it as getting something off their chest, the method is problematic.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they felt good that the other person was suffering. That's a red flag. Taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune is generally frowned upon. The friends' reactions suggest that the author overstepped. Even though there was a history of bullying, the response was not constructive. It's possible the author wanted closure or to feel empowered, but the approach was harsh and unkind.\n\nAnother angle is empathy. The author is in a better position now, but instead of showing compassion or even remaining neutral, they chose to highlight the contrast between their success and the other person's struggles. This can be seen as rubbing salt in a wound. The woman was already struggling, and the author's comments added insult to her injury.\n\nAdditionally, the situation was exacerbated by the author being drunk, which might have lowered their inhibitions and made them less considerate of the impact of their words. However, being drunk isn't an excuse for hurtful behavior. The author should have considered the other person's feelings, especially given the context of their past interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a valid history of being bullied, their reaction was inappropriate. Taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune and using the encounter to boast and belittle is unethical and cruel. The author should have handled the situation with more maturity and empathy, even if they wanted to address past grievances. Therefore, the answer is A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
