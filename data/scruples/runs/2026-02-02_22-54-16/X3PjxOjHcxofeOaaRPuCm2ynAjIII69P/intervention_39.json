HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, specifically a former bully. The situation involves the author, who had a tough time in high school being bullied by this girl (dubbed \"Douchebag\"). Now, the author is successful and ran into her, who's struggling with being a single mom. The author bragged about their success and made some harsh comments when drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a history of being bullied, which is significant. The bully didn't stop until the author turned 18, which means it was ongoing. Now, the author is in a better place, and upon meeting the former bully, who's in a tough spot, they feel vindicated. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified given the past.\n\nThe author was drunk and admitted to feeling good that the former bully was suffering. They also said they didn't feel sorry for her. The friends called them an asshole, but the author is conflicted because they felt they needed to vent their system. The question is if this makes the author wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's important to consider empathy and the impact of one's actions. Even if someone has been wronged in the past, retaliating or showing schadenfreude (pleasure from someone else's misfortune) can be seen as harmful. The author's comments, especially in a vulnerable moment where the former bully is already struggling, might come off as cruel. Even if the author has a history with her, deliberately highlighting their success and the other's struggles could be hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author's justification is that they needed to get their feelings out. They might have felt that the former bully's actions were part of the reason for her current struggles, but that's a stretch. People's life circumstances are complex and often not due to past behaviors. Also, the author's comments were made in a social setting, possibly in front of friends, which could add to the humiliation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a moment of personal catharsis, maybe feeling empowered after years of being a target. They might not have intended to be mean, but the effect was negative. The key is intent vs. impact. Even if the intent was to vent, the impact on the other person was negative. \n\nBut then again, the author was drunk, which might have clouded their judgment. However, being drunk doesn't excuse harmful behavior. The author had a choice in how they responded. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally frowned upon to gloat over someone else's misfortunes, even if they've wronged you. It's seen as petty and lacking in compassion. The author's actions, while perhaps understandable given their history, don't align with societal expectations of kindness and empathy.\n\nSo, weighing all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong. They used a vulnerable person's situation to assert their own success, which is not appropriate. Even though there's context, the way they handled it was hurtful and unkind. The author might benefit from reflecting on whether their actions were a healthy way to process past trauma or if it was a harmful reaction.\n"
