HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author, a 27-year-old man, had a tough time in high school, being overweight, having acne, and getting bullied, especially by this girl they call \"douchebag.\" Now, he's successful with a high-paying job and is engaged. When he sees her again, she's a single mom struggling, and he feels the need to brag about his success while being drunk.\n\nFirst, I should consider the core issue: is it wrong to express schadenfreude (taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune) when you've previously been the victim of their bullying? The author's friends called him a \"huge asshole,\" but he's questioning if his reaction is justified because he had to vent. \n\nOn one hand, the author was a victim of bullying for years, which is a serious issue. The emotional impact of that can't be ignored. When he encounters the former bully, he might be feeling a mix of emotions, and in a moment of vulnerability (being drunk), he lashes out. But on the other hand, even if someone has wronged you in the past, when they're in a difficult situation now, is it okay to rub your success in their face?\n\nThe author's actions led to the woman being visibly upset and annoyed. That's a negative consequence. The key here is the intent and the impact. While the author might feel that the woman \"deserved\" to struggle, especially after her past behavior, intentionally making someone feel worse in the moment, regardless of their past actions, can still be hurtful. Especially since she is a single mother, which is a challenging role, and she was already in a hard place. \n\nAlso, the author's statement about not feeling sorry and being glad she's suffering is harsh. Even if someone was bullying you, if they're now struggling, it's important to consider empathy. The author might have a right to feel validated in their success, but the way he expressed it\u2014bragging and being confrontational\u2014was inappropriate. \n\nMoreover, the author's excuse is that he was drunk and needed to get it out of his system. While intoxication can affect judgment, it doesn't excuse hurtful behavior. People are generally expected to be mindful of how their actions affect others, even when drunk, and to avoid contributing to someone's distress, especially if they're in a vulnerable situation. \n\nThe friends' reaction that he was a \"huge asshole\" suggests that his behavior crossed a line. The fact that he was an adult and she was a parent in a tough spot might mean that his actions were unkind and not considerate of her current circumstances. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's past experiences with bullying are valid, and he's achieved success. However, the way he chose to express his feelings\u2014by being cruel and making her feel worse\u2014was inconsiderate and harmful. Therefore, he is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
