HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother they used to bully. The situation involves past bullying, the author's success, and a confrontation where the author boasted about their achievements while the other person was struggling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied in high school by this woman, which affected them deeply. They worked hard to improve their life and ended up successful. When they met again, the author, who was drunk, started bragging about their success and made a harsh comment about not feeling sorry for the other person. \n\nNow, the key points here are the intentions and the impact. The author justifies their actions by saying they needed to \"get it out of their system\" and that they felt good the other person was suffering. However, even if there was past harm, intentionally making someone feel worse in the moment is generally considered inconsiderate. \n\nBragging, especially when someone is already in a vulnerable situation (struggling as a single mother), can be seen as insensitive. The fact that the author was drunk might explain their behavior but doesn't excuse it. The friends' reactions also indicate that the author's actions were socially inappropriate. \n\nThe ethical aspect here is about empathy and respect. Even if someone has been unkind in the past, adults are expected to handle such situations with maturity. The author's response could be seen as taking pleasure in another's misfortune, which is typically frowned upon. \n\nHowever, there's also the context of long-standing negative experiences. The author might feel justified due to the past bullying, but that doesn't necessarily make their actions right. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong regardless of their past. \n\nIn most social standards, gloating over someone else's struggles is considered wrong. So, even if the author has a history with the person, the act of bragging and making a harsh comment when the other person is already struggling is inconsiderate and hurtful. The author might not be in the wrong morally if they believe in justified retaliation, but socially and ethically, it's more likely they are in the wrong because their actions caused harm in the present moment.\n"
