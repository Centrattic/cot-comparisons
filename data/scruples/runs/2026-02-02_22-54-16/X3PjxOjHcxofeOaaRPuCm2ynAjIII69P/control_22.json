HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old man who had a tough time in high school, being bullied by a girl named Douchebag. He's now successful, with a high-paying job and engaged. They met again when he was back in town, and during a night out, he ended up talking to her. She's a single mom struggling as a waitress. The author, while drunk, started bragging about his success and said some harsh things, making her upset. His friends called him an asshole, but he feels justified because of her past behavior towards him.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the context of past bullying is important. He was bullied for years, which is no small thing. But does that justify his response now? The key here is the current situation. He chose to confront her and brag, even though she didn't seem to recognize him initially and was being polite. She was a single mom, struggling, and he used that as an opportunity to point out her struggles and express his lack of sympathy. \n\nEven though he was drunk, that doesn't entirely excuse the behavior. People can still be held accountable for their actions when under the influence. Also, the emotional impact on her is significant. She was already in a tough spot, and his comments would have been hurtful. \n\nThe author's justification is that he needed to \"get it out of his system\" and that he feels justified because she was mean to him before. But that's a form of revenge, which is generally not considered acceptable. The fact that he felt good about her suffering suggests a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. \n\nHis friends' reaction also indicates that the behavior was inappropriate. While the author's past is sympathetic, the way he handled the situation was not. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. Even if someone has a history of being wronged, taking revenge in a cruel manner is usually considered wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was in a position of power (his success vs. her struggle) adds another layer. It's not just about past bullying but also about using his success to belittle someone else who is down on their luck. That's often seen as unkind and arrogant. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. Even with the context of past mistreatment, the way he reacted was inappropriate. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
