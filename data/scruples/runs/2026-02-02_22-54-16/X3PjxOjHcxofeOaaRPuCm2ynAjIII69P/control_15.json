HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The story is about someone who used to be bullied in high school by a girl named Douchebag. Now, they've both grown up, and the author is successful while Douchebag is a struggling single mother. When they meet, the author brags about their success and even says they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. The author is trying to figure out if they're an asshole for this.\n\nSo, first, I need to analyze the key points here. The author was a victim of bullying in the past. That's important context because it explains some of their feelings. But when they meet Douchebag, who's now struggling, the author uses the opportunity to boast and express satisfaction that she's not doing well. The question is whether this makes them an asshole.\n\nI think the main issue here is the author's reaction. Even though they had a hard time before, their response in the moment was to rub their success in her face. The fact that they were drunk might mitigate some responsibility, but it's still their choice to make those comments. The friends called them a huge asshole, and the author is questioning if that's fair.\n\nThe author feels justified because they had a bad past experience, but that doesn't necessarily make their actions okay. Reaching out to someone who's struggling and being insensitive, especially if it's someone who wronged you in the past, can still be considered inconsiderate. It's one thing to have mixed feelings and another to act on them in a way that's harmful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling good that she's suffering. That's a key part. Taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune is generally seen as unkind, regardless of past issues. Even if they had a bad experience, it's not a valid reason to gloat. The situation might be complicated by the fact that the person was a bully before, but that doesn't excuse the current behavior. Everyone deserves a certain level of respect and kindness, even former bullies.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. They chose to make someone who was already struggling feel worse, which is not the right thing to do. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
