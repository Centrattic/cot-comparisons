HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who used to bully him. The author has a successful life now, but back in high school, he was bullied by this girl. He saw her again when he was older, she's a single mom working as a waitress, and he ended up bragging about his success while he was drunk. The friends said he was an asshole, but the author is conflicted because he felt justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Even if someone has been a bully in the past, does that justify derogatory behavior towards them when they're in a vulnerable position now? The author was drunk, which might reduce his responsibility but doesn't eliminate it entirely. He was an adult, so he should have known better.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and respect. The woman is a single mother struggling, and while she may have been cruel before, she's in a difficult situation now. The author's actions could be seen as taking pleasure in her misfortune, which is unkind. People can change, and holding onto past grudges might not be the most mature response.\n\nThen there's the social context. Bragging about one's success in someone else's face, especially when they're down on their luck, is generally frowned upon. The author's friends called him out, which suggests that his actions were socially unacceptable even if he felt justified. Also, his comment about not feeling sorry for her and being glad she's suffering is pretty harsh. It shows a lack of compassion.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a rough past and might have been feeling empowered by his success. He could have been trying to assert his current position. However, the way he did it was inappropriate. There's a right way and a wrong way to address past issues. The wrong way is through public humiliation or belittlement, especially when the person is already struggling.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, yes, because he took advantage of the situation to express his satisfaction in her suffering. From a social standpoint, it's definitely inconsiderate. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. He should have handled it with more empathy and refrained from bragging, especially when he could see it was making her upset.\n"
