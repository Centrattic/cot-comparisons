HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now a struggling single mother. The author had a tough time in high school, was bullied by this girl, and now he's successful. They met at a club, she didn't recognize him initially, but then they talked. He ended up bragging about his success and even said he doesn't feel sorry for her and is glad she's suffering.\n\nHmm. The author's friends called him an asshole for saying that, but he feels justified because of the past. So, the question is, is he wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He had been bullied for a long time, which is a serious issue. The emotional impact of that can't be ignored. He's now in a position where he can see the person who bullied him is struggling. But he chose to rub his success in her face, even when she was vulnerable. \n\nBut wait, the key point is that he was drunk and maybe acting out of years of pent-up feelings. However, even under the influence, his actions had consequences. The woman might have been in a bad place, and his comments could have hurt her. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he felt good about her suffering. That's a red flag. Taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune, especially someone who might be facing difficulties, is generally considered unkind. Even if he has a history with her, it's not acceptable to derive satisfaction from their struggles.\n\nMoreover, the act of bragging in that situation could be seen as cruel. She was already talking about her struggles, and he used that as an opportunity to boast. That's not empathy; that's using her hardship to make himself feel better. \n\nI should also think about the broader implications. While past trauma is valid, acting out in a way that harms others isn't justified. The author might have unprocessed anger or resentment, but that doesn't give him the right to hurt her. It's possible he needs to address those feelings in a healthier way, like through therapy, rather than lashing out.\n\nOn the other hand, he did acknowledge his past and the bullying. He's honest about his feelings, which is a step towards self-awareness. But the action itself\u2014bragging and expressing schadenfreude\u2014is where the problem lies. \n\nSo, even though there's context, the behavior is still inappropriate. The author's actions caused the woman emotional distress and were unkind. Therefore, he is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
