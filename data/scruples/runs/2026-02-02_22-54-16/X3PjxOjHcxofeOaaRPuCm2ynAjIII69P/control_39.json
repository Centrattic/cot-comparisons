HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, especially considering the past context. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was bullied by this girl, \"douchebag,\" during high school. Now, he's successful, and they meet again. The author feels a sense of superiority and ends up bragging about his success when they talk. The key points here are the history of bullying, the current situation where the other person is struggling, and the author's actions during their interaction.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the ethics here. Even though the author was bullied in the past, does that justify bragging when they meet again? The author was drunk, which might affect judgment, but it's not a complete excuse. The other person was open and vulnerable, talking about her struggles. The author's response was not just sharing his success but making it clear he doesn't feel sorry and is glad she's suffering. That's pretty harsh.\n\nEmpathy is a big factor here. Even if there was past animosity, the current situation involves a single mother who's struggling. The author's actions could be seen as taking pleasure in her misfortune, which is generally considered unkind. The friends called him an asshole, which aligns with the idea that his actions were inappropriate.\n\nBut there's also the context of past trauma. The author might be dealing with unresolved feelings from being bullied. However, acting out those feelings in the moment, especially when the person is in a vulnerable position, isn't helpful or right. The author might need to process his feelings through healthier means rather than lashing out.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer hinges on whether past grievances justify present-day cruelty. Even with context, the author's actions were unkind and contributed to someone else's discomfort. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
