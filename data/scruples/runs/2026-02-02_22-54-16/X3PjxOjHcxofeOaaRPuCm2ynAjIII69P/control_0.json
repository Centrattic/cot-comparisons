HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, specifically someone who was mean to them in the past.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author was bullied by this person, and now, after achieving success, they meet again. The author feels some vindication and uses the encounter to boast about their success while the other person is struggling. \n\nSo the key points here: The author was a victim of bullying, which is hurtful. The other person, \"douchebag,\" was particularly cruel. Now, the author has turned their life around, and they meet again. The author, while drunk, starts bragging about their 6-figure job and comments on the other's struggles, even saying they don't feel sorry and are glad she's suffering. \n\nThe friends think the author was an asshole, but the author feels justified due to past experiences. The central question is whether the author's actions make them the asshole.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone has been wronged, taking pleasure in another's misfortune and actively belittling them can be seen as unforgiving and cruel. While the past bullying is a valid reason for hurt, the way the author responded might not be considered acceptable. The author's comments could be seen as rubbing salt in a wound, which is generally frowned upon. \n\nHowever, the author's past trauma might influence their behavior. But does that justify their actions? People are often expected to rise above past grievances, especially when the other person seems to have matured. The author's admission that they felt good about the other's suffering is a red flag. Feeling pleasure in someone else's misfortune is typically considered a negative trait, regardless of past experiences.\n\nAlso, the author was drunk, which might mitigate some responsibility, but it's not an excuse for cruel behavior. The friends' reaction also suggests that the behavior was out of line. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, even with the context of past bullying, the author's actions were inconsiderate and unkind. The justification based on past experiences doesn't excuse the behavior. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
