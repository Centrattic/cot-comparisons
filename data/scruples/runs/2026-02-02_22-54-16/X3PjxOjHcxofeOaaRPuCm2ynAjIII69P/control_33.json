HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, specifically a former bully. The situation is complex because there's a history of bullying, and the author feels some vindication.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author was bullied by someone (dubbed \"douchebag\") during high school and into adulthood. Now, the author has achieved success, while the former bully is struggling as a single mother. They meet again, and the author, in a state of intoxication, starts bragging about their success, which makes the other person upset. The author justifies it by feeling that it's their time to be on top and that the bully's struggles are deserved.\n\nThe main question is whether this behavior is wrong. Let's consider the elements. The author has a history of being bullied, which is valid and painful. However, when they encounter the person who bullied them and she's in a tough spot, the author's response is to belittle and boast. Even if the bully was mean before, the author's actions now are in a context where the other person is vulnerable.\n\nThere's the aspect of empathy. The former bully might be struggling now, and maybe she's not the same person anymore. The author's bragging and dismissive attitude could be seen as cruel, especially since the woman did acknowledge their success and seemed to express genuine happiness for the author. The author's response, even if fueled by past pain, crosses a line by taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune.\n\nAlso, the author's friends called them an asshole, which adds a social perspective. Even if the author felt the need to 'release' their emotions, the way they expressed it was hurtful. The justification that it's \"justified\" because of past bullying doesn't excuse the current behavior. People can have complex emotions, but acting on them in a way that harms another person is generally not acceptable.\n\nAnother angle is the drunk behavior. While it's a mitigating factor, it's not an excuse. The author should have been aware of their actions and the potential impact. The intent versus the impact is important here. Even if the author intended to vent, the effect was negative on the other person.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, society often values empathy and kindness, especially towards those who are vulnerable. The author's actions lack both, even if there's a history of mistreatment. The past doesn't automatically grant permission to repay harm with harm. The woman's current situation might be different from her past behavior, and she might be facing her own challenges now.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons for past pain, their actions in the present were inconsiderate and harmful. They are in the wrong for taking pleasure in someone else's struggle and for bragging in a way that caused distress. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
