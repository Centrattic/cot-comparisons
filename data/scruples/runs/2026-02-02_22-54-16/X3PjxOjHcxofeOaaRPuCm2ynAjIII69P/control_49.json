HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now struggling. The author had a tough time in high school with this girl, who bullied them. Now, years later, the author is successful, and they meet this woman again. She's a single mom, working as a waitress, and the author feels entitled to rub their success in her face, especially when they see her struggling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they were bullied, which is a valid past experience. But the key point is their reaction in the present. Even if the woman was a bully before, the author chose to confront her with condescension and a lack of empathy when she's in a vulnerable position now. The author admits they were drunk and said hurtful things, which complicates things because alcohol can lower inhibitions, but that doesn't excuse the behavior.\n\nThe author's friends called them an asshole, which is a social judgment. The author rationalizes it by saying they needed to get it out, but that's more about their own feelings than considering the other person's. Feeling good that someone else is suffering is a classic sign of schadenfreude, which is generally seen as unkind. Even if there was past mistreatment, taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune isn't considered morally acceptable. \n\nAlso, the author's comments about not feeling sorry and being glad she's suffering cross a line. It's one thing to feel a sense of personal triumph, but actively belittling someone in a moment of vulnerability is harmful. The woman was trying to be mature and friendly, according to the author, so the response was unnecessarily harsh. \n\nThe fact that the author is seeking validation here suggests some internal conflict. They might feel justified because of past pain, but that doesn't negate the hurt they caused now. The situation isn't about revenge or justice; it's about the lack of compassion in the present. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. Even with a history of bullying, the way they handled the encounter was inappropriate. The answer is likely A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
