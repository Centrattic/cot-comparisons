HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author, a 27-year-old man, had a tough time in high school being bullied by a girl he calls \"Douchebag.\" He's now successful with a high-paying job and an engagement. He ran into her again, and when he saw she was struggling as a single mother, he felt the urge to brag about his success and even said he's glad she's suffering. He's questioning if he's in the wrong because he felt justified in his feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a victim of bullying, which is a serious issue. He's now in a better place in life. When he sees his old bully in a difficult situation, he uses the opportunity to boast and even express schadenfreude. \n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) He was drunk, which might affect his judgment but doesn't excuse his actions. 2) He felt the need to \"get it out of his system,\" implying unresolved issues from being bullied. 3) He openly expressed lack of empathy and even took pleasure in her misfortune.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone has been wronged, taking pleasure in their suffering is generally frowned upon. The author's actions were mean-spirited, especially since the other person seemed to be trying to be mature and happy for him. The author's friends called him an asshole, which is a common reaction to such behavior.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of past trauma. The author might still be dealing with the emotional impact of being bullied, and this encounter triggered some unresolved feelings. But does that justify his response? Probably not. There are healthier ways to address past hurts than to gloat when someone else is struggling.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his actions were appropriate despite his past. Even though he was a victim, his response was unkind and lacked empathy. So, yes, he is in the wrong for his behavior, even if there's context. The right choice is A.\n"
