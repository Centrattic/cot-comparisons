HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves someone who, after overcoming a tough high school experience, meets an old bully who is now a struggling single mother. The author ends up bragging about their success and making cutting remarks while drunk.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key elements here. The author was bullied by this person, which is a significant factor. But now, the bully is in a difficult position. The author's actions were during a chance encounter, and they were drunk. The main question is whether the author's behavior was justified given their past.\n\nThe author's actions: bragging and expressing a lack of sympathy. Even though they were drunk, the intent seems to be to assert their own success against someone who previously wronged them. The friends called them an asshole, but the author justifies it as needing to get their feelings out. \n\nThe key points to consider here are empathy, context, and intent. Even if the person being spoken to is a former bully, the author's response could be seen as cruel. The former bully is now a struggling single mother, which adds another layer. The author's comments might have been hurtful and insensitive, regardless of the past. \n\nAlso, the author admits to feeling good that she's suffering, which suggests a desire for some form of revenge or schadenfreude. This can be problematic because it shows a lack of empathy for someone who's in a tough spot. Even if the person was a bully in the past, that doesn't necessarily justify being cruel now, especially when they're vulnerable.\n\nAnother angle is the social context. The author was in a situation where they could have chosen to ignore the past and show maturity, but instead chose to confront it in a hurtful way. The fact that the author was drunk might mitigate some responsibility, but not all. People are generally held accountable for their actions even when intoxicated, especially if they can anticipate the consequences.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering the analysis, the answer seems to be A. The author's actions were hurtful and lacked empathy, regardless of past experiences. Even with a history of being bullied, the way they responded was not appropriate and caused distress. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
