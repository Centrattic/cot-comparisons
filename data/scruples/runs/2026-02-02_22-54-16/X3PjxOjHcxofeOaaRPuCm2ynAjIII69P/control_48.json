HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who once bullied him. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author, 27M, had a tough high school experience with bullying from a girl called \"Douchebag.\" He managed to turn his life around, got a good job, and is engaged. He ran into her again and she's now a struggling single mom. He felt vindicated and started bragging about his success while she's struggling. He even said he felt good that she was suffering and that he didn't feel sorry for her. His friends think he was a jerk, but he's unsure if he's justified.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. He was a victim of bullying, which is serious. However, his response to her current situation is where the issue lies. Even though he had a bad past with her, he had the chance to show empathy. Instead, he chose to belittle her, especially when she was vulnerable. \n\nHe mentions being drunk, but that's not a complete excuse for his actions. People can still choose how they behave, even if impaired. The key points here are: 1) He took pleasure in her misfortune, which is often referred to as schadenfreude. 2) He didn't show compassion despite her current struggles, even if she was a bully before. 3) He was in a position where he could have offered support or at least been neutral, but instead he escalated the situation.\n\nThere's also the aspect of karma. He might feel that her struggles are a result of her past actions, but that doesn't justify being cruel. People can change, and her current situation as a single mother might be due to various factors beyond her past behavior. It's possible she's also facing challenges that he's unaware of.\n\nThe author's friends called him an asshole, which is a common reaction when someone takes satisfaction in another's downfall. Even if the person deserved it, rubbing success in someone's face when they're struggling isn't considered kind or mature. The author's need to \"get it out his system\" might be a way to process his past trauma, but public shaming or mocking someone in a vulnerable state isn't healthy or right.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, society generally values compassion and empathy. So even if someone has been a bully, if they're in a hard place, the expected response is to offer support or at least not add to their suffering. The author's actions crossed that line by making her feel worse instead of showing understanding.\n\nAlso, the fact that he felt good about her suffering suggests a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. While everyone might experience some level of schadenfreude for people who've wronged them, acting on it in a hurtful way is problematic. \n\nSo putting it all together, even with the context, the author's actions were inconsiderate and unkind. He had the chance to move past the past and respond with maturity but instead chose to taunt, which makes him the asshole. Answer A.\n"
