HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now struggling. \n\nFirst, the context: the author had a tough time in high school being bullied by \"Douchebag,\" who was particularly harsh. After university, the author's life improved significantly, while their former bully is now a single mother struggling financially. At a nightclub, they meet again, and the author, under the influence of alcohol, starts bragging about their success and comments on the other's struggles, making the other person upset.\n\nThe key points here are intent, context, and the nature of the interaction. The author mentions they were drunk, which might mitigate intent but not entirely. They felt justified in expressing their feelings because of past bullying. However, the way they approached the situation\u2014bragging and making a point about not feeling sorry\u2014could be seen as cruel, even if there's history.\n\nThe author's friends called them an asshole, which is a social judgment. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong beyond just social judgment. Ethically, even if someone has been wronged, taking pleasure in another's misfortune and then mocking them might cross a line. The author's satisfaction in the other's suffering could be seen as vindictive or lacking empathy, especially given that the person is now a single mother facing hard times.\n\nHowever, the author's past experiences might influence their emotional state. They might feel a need to process their own journey and the contrast with their former bully. But public shaming or rubbing it in isn't typically considered a healthy or acceptable way to deal with past trauma.\n\nSo, while there's context, the action of publicly belittling someone else in their moment of vulnerability, even an ex-bully, is generally seen as inconsiderate and unkind. The justification based on past mistreatment doesn't necessarily make the current action right. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
