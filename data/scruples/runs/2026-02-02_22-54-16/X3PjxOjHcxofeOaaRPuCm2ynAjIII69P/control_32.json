HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who is now struggling. The author was bullied in high school by this woman, and years later, when they meet again, he brags about his success while she's a single mom working as a waitress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a tough time being bullied, which is understandable. But now, he's in a better position. The key issue here is whether his actions were justified. He was drunk, which might affect his judgment, but that's not an excuse for being cruel.\n\nHe mentions that he felt good because she was suffering. That's a red flag because taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune isn't healthy. Even though he had a bad past with her, confronting her with his success in a derogatory way isn't the right approach. \n\nThe woman didn't recognize him initially, and when they talked, she seemed mature and happy to see him. But he turned the conversation into a bragging session, making her feel upset. His friends called him an asshole, which adds to the idea that his actions were inappropriate.\n\nEven if he felt the need to \"get it out of his system,\" the way he did it was hurtful. It's important to consider empathy here. She's a single mother struggling, and instead of showing any compassion, he gloated. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and rubbing someone's face in their past. \n\nAlso, the author's statement that he didn't feel sorry for her and was glad she's suffering shows a lack of empathy. People can make mistakes and change, even if they were mean in the past. The author's reaction seems more about his own unresolved feelings rather than her current situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were wrong. He crossed a line by taking pleasure in her struggles and using the encounter to boast about his success. The context of past bullying doesn't justify being cruel now. Everyone deserves respect, regardless of their past actions.\n"
