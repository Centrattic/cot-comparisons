HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who used to bully him.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The author had a tough high school experience with this girl, who was mean and bullied him. Now, years later, he's successful, and they meet again. He's drunk, starts bragging about his success, and even says he's glad she's struggling. His friends call him an asshole, but he feels justified because of past experiences.\n\nSo, the main question is whether his actions are wrong. Let me break it down. Bullying is a serious issue, but how does that translate to the present situation? The author was the victim, which gives some context. However, the scenario now is that the former bully is struggling, and he's taking pleasure in her misfortune. That's called schadenfreude, right?\n\nEven though he was bullied, acting out in this way might not be justified. The fact that he was drunk could mitigate his responsibility slightly, but it doesn't excuse it entirely. Intentionally making someone feel bad, especially when they are vulnerable (a single mother with two kids), seems harsh. She was trying to have a conversation, and he turned it into a confrontation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he felt good about her suffering. That's a red flag. While past trauma can affect someone's behavior, taking pleasure in another's misfortune, even if they were once unkind, crosses a line. It's about empathy. The woman is struggling with her own life, and instead of offering support or at least maintaining some decorum, he used the opportunity to belittle her.\n\nHis friends' reaction suggests that what he did was socially unacceptable. Even if he felt the need to \"get it out of his system,\" there are healthier ways to address past hurt. Confronting her with mockery and a lack of compassion isn't the right approach. It's possible that he's still dealing with unresolved anger from high school, but that doesn't mean acting out in a harmful way is okay.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't have to engage with her. If he felt uncomfortable around her or had negative feelings, he could have excused himself instead of attacking her. His behavior could have been hurtful, especially considering her current situation as a struggling parent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the past context explains some of his feelings, his actions were unkind and inappropriate. People who were once unkind in the past don't necessarily deserve cruelty now. The author's response was vindictive and lacked empathy, which makes him at fault here. So the answer is A.\n"
