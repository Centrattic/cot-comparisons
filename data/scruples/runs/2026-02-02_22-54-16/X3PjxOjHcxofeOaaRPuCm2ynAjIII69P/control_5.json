HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (27M) had a tough time in high school being bullied by this girl called \"douchebag.\" They ended up turning their life around, getting a good job, etc. Then they meet this girl again, and she's struggling as a single mom. He ends up bragging about his success and saying he's not sorry she's suffering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had been bullied, so there's a history of negative treatment. The person they met did some mean things, and the author is now in a better position. But when they meet again, the author uses the opportunity to boast and even says he's glad she's suffering. The key points here are the author's actions and their impact on the other person.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's acceptable to take pleasure in someone else's misfortune, especially if that person was previously unkind to you. The author might feel justified because of past experiences, but the ethical aspect is about how they treated someone in a vulnerable situation. \n\nThe other woman is a struggling single mother now, which is a challenging situation. Even if she was mean before, she's in a tough spot now. The author's comments could be seen as cruel and unkind, especially when she's trying to open up about her struggles. Using the encounter to brag and express schadenfreude isn't empathetic. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they were drunk, but that's not really a valid excuse for hurtful behavior. People are still responsible for their actions even when under the influence. The friends called him out for being an asshole, which adds another layer of social judgment.\n\nThe author might feel that they needed to confront their past, but the way they did it was inconsiderate. It's possible they wanted revenge or validation, but hurting someone else in the process isn't justified. The fact that the woman was visibly upset indicates that the author's words had a negative impact, which makes their actions problematic.\n\nIn terms of morality, taking pleasure in someone else's suffering is generally considered wrong. Even if there's a history of conflict, it's important to treat people with dignity. The author's behavior crosses a line from justified self-expression to being mean-spirited.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). The key factors are the unkindness towards someone in need, taking advantage of a vulnerable moment, and deriving satisfaction from their misery, which isn't acceptable regardless of past grievances.\n"
