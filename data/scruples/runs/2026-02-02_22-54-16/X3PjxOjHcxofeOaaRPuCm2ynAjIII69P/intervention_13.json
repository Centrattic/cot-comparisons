HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old man who has a high-paying job and is engaged. He had a tough time in high school with bullying, especially from a girl he calls \"douchebag.\" She was particularly mean to him. After university, he turned his life around, lost weight, got a good degree, and things are going well. He ran into this girl again when she was a struggling single mother, and he ended up bragging about his success while she was a waitress. He felt good that she was suffering and isn't sure if that makes him an asshole. His friends think he's an ass for being so harsh.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, let me think about the key points here. The author had a history of being bullied by this woman. He turned his life around, which is positive. However, when he met her again, he chose to confront her by bragging about his success while she was in a difficult situation. The context is important here. He mentions that they hadn't seen each other since high school, and she didn't recognize him initially. She seemed more mature and happy to see him, but he felt the need to bring up her current struggles.\n\nNow, the main question is whether his actions were wrong. On one hand, he was just sharing his success, and maybe he felt vindicated because of his past. On the other hand, he was in a position of power, both financially and emotionally, and used that to belittle her. He was drunk, which might affect his judgment, but it doesn't excuse it entirely.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The woman was struggling, and he made her feel upset. Even if she was a bully in the past, confronting her in this way when she's vulnerable might not be the right approach. The author might have been trying to deal with his own unresolved feelings from being bullied, but taking it out on someone else, especially when they're in a tough spot, can be seen as cruel.\n\nAlso, the fact that he felt good about her suffering suggests a desire for some form of revenge or validation. While people can have complicated emotions about past bullies, acting on those feelings in a way that harms another person, even if they were once a bully, is generally considered wrong. Society tends to value compassion and empathy, even for those who have wronged us in the past.\n\nHis friends called him an asshole, which is a social judgment, and the author is questioning if that's fair. But even if he felt it was justified, the key is how his actions affected the other person. Bragging and making negative comments when someone is struggling isn't kind or supportive. It's possible that he wanted closure or to feel better about himself, but doing so at the expense of someone else's dignity is problematic.\n\nIn terms of morality, the act of taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune, especially a former bully, might be seen as petty. It's important to note that people can change, and the woman might have matured since high school. The author's response doesn't acknowledge any growth on her part and instead focuses on her current struggles as a form of poetic justice.\n\nSo considering all these points, the author's actions were hurtful and unkind. Even if he had a valid reason for his feelings, expressing them in that manner was inappropriate. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
