HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a rough time in high school with bullying, including from this girl called douchebag. Now, years later, they meet again. The girl is struggling as a single mother, and the author, who's done well in life, starts bragging about his success. He mentions his 6-figure job and comments on her struggles, even saying he doesn't feel sorry for her and is glad she's suffering. He was drunk, but he still made those comments.\n\nThe key points here are the context of past bullying, the current situation where the woman is in a tough spot, and the author's reaction. The author's friends called him an asshole, but he feels he's justified because of his past. \n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms, even if someone has been a bully in the past, when they're struggling, it's generally seen as unkind to rub success in their face. The author's comments, especially the part about not feeling sorry and being glad she's suffering, are clearly hurtful. Even if there was past mistreatment, the mature response would be to show compassion or at least refrain from gloating. \n\nThe author's actions were mean-spirited, especially since the woman was initially friendly. The fact that he felt good about her suffering shows a lack of empathy. People often seek to resolve past grievances in healthier ways, not by belittling others when they're vulnerable. So, even though there's context, the action of bragging and taking pleasure in her misfortune makes him the asshole here. The answer is A.\n"
