HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now a struggling single mother. The author had a tough high school time being bullied by this person, then succeeded in life. When they met again, the author, while drunk, started bragging about their success and made some harsh comments, which upset the other person. The friends called them an asshole, but the author justifies it as needing to get it out.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the context of past bullying, the current situation where the bully is struggling, and the author's reaction. The author claims they felt justified because of past treatment. But does that make it okay?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone has been wronged, retaliating or showing schadenfreude isn't typically seen as acceptable. The author's comments were hurtful and condescending, especially considering the other person's current struggles. Even though the author had a valid reason for past pain, the way they expressed it was inappropriate. Bragging and deriving satisfaction from someone else's misfortune can be harmful and unkind.\n\nAlso, the author was drunk, which might explain the behavior but doesn't excuse it. Intent matters, but the impact of the words still counts. The fact that the author felt \"good\" about the other's suffering shows a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. While the author might have built up resentment over the years, lashing out in that manner isn't a constructive way to handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did mention the context of being a victim of bullying, which adds complexity. However, just because someone was bullied doesn't mean they're obligated to be kind to their bully, but it's still a matter of how to handle those feelings maturely. The friends' reaction also suggests that the author overstepped.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions were hurtful and unkind, regardless of past experiences. The justification based on past bullying doesn't absolve them of being in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
