HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother they used to bully. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a rough high school experience being bullied by someone they call \"douchebag.\" Now, they've turned their life around with a good job, a partner, etc. They run into this person again, who's now a struggling single mom. The author, while drunk, starts bragging about their success and comments on the other person's struggles, which upsets her.\n\nThe key points here are: the context of past bullying, the author's current success, and the way they interacted during the encounter. The author justifies their behavior by saying they needed to vent and felt justified because of the past treatment. Their friends called them an asshole, but the author isn't sure if they are.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, even if someone has been wronged in the past, does that justify belittling someone else, especially when they're in a vulnerable situation? The author had the chance to maybe show empathy or at least be kind, but instead chose to boast and make the other person feel worse. Even if the other person was a bully before, it's important to consider their current circumstances. The author's actions were hurtful and insensitive, regardless of their past. Also, the fact that they were drunk might explain the behavior but doesn't excuse it. Being in a vulnerable state (drunk) doesn't justify hurting someone else.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have unresolved feelings from their past, but taking it out on someone now, especially when they're struggling, isn't the right approach. The friends' reaction suggests that the author overstepped. The author's satisfaction in seeing the other person suffer is a red flag. It shows a lack of compassion and possibly a desire for revenge, which isn't healthy or acceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, even with the context, the author's actions were wrong. They could have handled the situation with more maturity and empathy. So, the answer is A.\n"
