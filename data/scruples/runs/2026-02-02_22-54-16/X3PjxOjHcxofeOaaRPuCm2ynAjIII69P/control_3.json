HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a person who had a tough time in high school being bullied by a girl. Now, after succeeding, they meet the girl again and end up bragging and making hurtful comments when they see her struggling. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied in the past by this person. They had a hard time, and now they've turned their life around. When they meet again, the author is drunk and ends up being confrontational. They express that they don't feel sorry for the other person and even take pleasure in her suffering. Friends call them an asshole, but the author is questioning if their actions are justified.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's okay to take pleasure in someone else's suffering, especially someone you had a negative past with. Even if there was past mistreatment, does that give the author the right to be cruel in return?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, most ethical frameworks emphasize empathy and kindness, regardless of the other person's past. The fact that the author is in a position of success and uses it to belittle someone else in a vulnerable situation is problematic. The author's statement about not feeling sorry and being glad she's suffering is clearly unkind and vindictive. \n\nEven if the author is processing their own emotions or past trauma, intentionally hurting someone else isn't justified. The friends' reactions support that the author overstepped. The key point is that the author's actions were hurtful and lacked compassion, regardless of the past. So, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
