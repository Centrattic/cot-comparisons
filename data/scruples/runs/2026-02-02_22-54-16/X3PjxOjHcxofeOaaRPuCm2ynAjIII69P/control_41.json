HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother. The author had a rough past with this person, who was mean to them in high school. Now, the author is successful and encountered this person, who is struggling. They ended up bragging about their success and expressing satisfaction that the other person is suffering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they were bullied, which could influence their feelings. But even with that, the reaction of feeling good that someone else is suffering seems problematic. The key points here are the author's actions and the impact they had on the other person. The author was drunk, which might affect their judgment, but that doesn't necessarily excuse their behavior.\n\nThe author's friends called them an asshole, and the author is questioning if their feelings are justified. Even if someone has a history of being treated poorly, taking pleasure in another's misfortune is generally seen as malicious. The author's comments were hurtful and could have made the other person feel worse, especially since she was already struggling. \n\nThe author's argument is that they needed to \"get it out of their system,\" but that doesn't mitigate the harm caused. It's important to consider empathy and how one's words affect others, regardless of past experiences. The fact that the author felt good about the other's suffering suggests a lack of compassion, which is a negative trait. \n\nSo, even with the context of past bullying, the author's actions were unkind and contributed to the other person's discomfort. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
