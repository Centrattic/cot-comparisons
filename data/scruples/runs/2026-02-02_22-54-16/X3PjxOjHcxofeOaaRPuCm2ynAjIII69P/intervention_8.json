HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves someone who was bullied in the past by a woman named Douchebag. Now, the author is successful, and when they meet Douchebag again, they end up bragging and making a harsh comment when she's struggling as a single mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author was a victim of bullying, which is serious. They worked hard to improve their life, which is commendable. However, when they encounter the person who bullied them, they take the opportunity to boast about their success and imply that the other person's current struggles are deserved. The author was drunk and admitted to feeling good about the other person's suffering. \n\nNow, even though the author has a history of being bullied, does that justify their behavior now? The question is about being in the wrong. Bullying is wrong, and revenge or schadenfreude (taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune) doesn't make the bully's actions right. The author might feel justified, but from a moral standpoint, intentionally hurting someone, even if they were a past bully, isn't typically seen as acceptable. \n\nAlso, the author's friends called them an asshole, which adds to the idea that their actions were socially inappropriate. The fact that the author felt good about the other person's suffering might indicate a lack of empathy, which is generally frowned upon. Even if there's a history, rubbing success in someone's face can be considered cruel. \n\nSo, while the author's past is understandable, their actions in the present situation cross a line. It's about how people treat each other irrespective of past grievances. The right choice here would be to choose empathy and kindness, not to take pleasure in someone else's hardship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, which would be answer A.\n"
