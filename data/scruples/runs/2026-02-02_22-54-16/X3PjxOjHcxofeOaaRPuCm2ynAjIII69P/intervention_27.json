HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 27, has a high-paying job, is engaged, and is doing well. But in high school, he was bullied by a girl called \"Douchebag.\" Now they've met again, and she's a struggling single mother. The author, who was once the victim, now seems to have turned the tables. When they reunite, he ends up bragging about his success and even says he's glad she's suffering. He was drunk and made some harsh comments, and his friends called him an asshole. He's conflicted because he feels it was justified given their past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The author was bullied for years, which is no small thing. Bullying can have lasting effects, and his resentment might be justified. However, when they meet again, she's in a difficult situation as a single mother. The author's comments were hurtful, especially given their history. Even if he was justified in feeling some satisfaction, the way he expressed it was cruel and insensitive.\n\nThe key points here are the context of past bullying and the current situation. The fact that she didn't recognize him initially and seemed more mature and happy to see him adds complexity. He took the opportunity to belittle her, which could be seen as petty. Even if he had a reason to feel vindicated, using someone else's struggles to feel better about himself is not a good look.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that he needed to let it out. But using someone else's hardship as a way to vent is not a healthy or respectful approach. The fact that his friends criticized him suggests that his actions crossed a line. The emotional impact on the woman who was already struggling is another factor. His comments could have been hurtful to her, especially if she was trying to move past her past.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of karma or poetic justice. Some might think it's fair that his bully is now in a worse position. However, this line of thinking can lead to further division and harm. The author's actions might not be malicious in the traditional sense, but they still contribute to a toxic dynamic. It's important to consider empathy and how his words affected her.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, while people can have complex emotions about past trauma, acting on those feelings in a way that harms others is generally frowned upon. The author's behavior can be seen as exploiting someone else's misfortune for personal satisfaction, which is considered inconsiderate.\n\nSo, balancing the past context against the present actions, I think the author's actions were inappropriate. Even if he had reasons to feel vindicated, the way he expressed those feelings was hurtful and unkind. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
