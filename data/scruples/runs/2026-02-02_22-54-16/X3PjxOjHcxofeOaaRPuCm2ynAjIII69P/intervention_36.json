HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is 27, has a high-paying job, is engaged, and is reflecting on his past where he was bullied. He ran into someone who was particularly mean to him, a girl called \"douchebag,\" and now she's a single mom with two kids, struggling. He met her in a club, she didn't recognize him, and he ended up bragging about his success while she was a waitress, making her upset. The author's friends called him an asshole, but he feels justified in his actions because of the past bullying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied for a long time, and this person was especially cruel. That's not something to ignore\u2014the emotional impact of bullying can be significant. However, when they meet again, he's in a position of success and she's struggling. He feels good that she's suffering, which he justifies as some kind of closure. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The immediate reaction is that bragging and making someone feel worse because of their past actions could be seen as unkind. Even if the person was a bully before, the author's response of being sarcastic and dismissive might be seen as cruel. The key points here are intent and empathy. The author was drunk, which might affect his judgment, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. \n\nAlso, the person the author met with has her own struggles now. Even if she was mean in the past, she's a single mother working as a waitress. The author's actions might be seen as taking pleasure in her current hardships, which is uncharitable. The author's friends said he was a huge asshole, which is a social judgment. \n\nBut the author's perspective is that he needed to \"get it out of his system,\" implying that the past bullying left emotional scars. He might feel a sense of vindication because he's now in a better position. However, that doesn't necessarily justify the way he treated her. The question is whether it's acceptable to harm someone else, even if they wronged you in the past.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, most people would say that holding a grudge and taking the opportunity to belittle someone, even if they were once a bully, is wrong. The author could have chosen a more compassionate approach, even if he didn't feel sorry for her. The fact that he felt good about her suffering might indicate a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. \n\nSo, while the author's past experiences are valid, his current actions are unkind and unprofessional. It's possible to acknowledge past hurt without being cruel in the present. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his behavior was unkind and he took pleasure in someone else's suffering, which is generally considered wrong regardless of past interactions.\n"
