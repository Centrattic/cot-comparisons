HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bragging to a former bully who's now a struggling single mom. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a tough time in high school being bullied by this girl, who was especially mean. Now, years later, the author is successful, and they run into this person. The author, who was once a victim, is now in a position of power. \n\nThe key points here are the author's actions. They started bragging about their success when the other person was already talking about her struggles. Even though the author was drunk, they intentionally said things that made the other person feel bad. The author admitted to feeling good that the former bully was suffering. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, even if someone has been wronged in the past, gloating over another's misfortunes is generally seen as unkind and immature. The author's friends called them an asshole, which suggests that their behavior wasn't socially acceptable. The author might feel justified because of past experiences, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. People often say that past actions don't excuse current ones. \n\nAlso, the author's statement about not feeling sorry and being glad the other person is suffering seems vindictive. It's about getting some sort of satisfaction from the other person's struggles, which is a negative emotion. Even if the former bully was cruel, the author's response might not contribute to any positive outcome. It could even deepen the resentment or hurt on both sides.\n\nAnother angle is empathy. The author is now in a better position, but instead of showing compassion or maybe even just being neutral, they chose to hurt. It's possible that the author wanted to assert their current success to the person who once looked down on them. However, that doesn't validate the behavior. \n\nThe author might argue that they were just being honest and that they had the right to express their feelings. But in social interactions, honesty doesn't always mean being hurtful. The way the information was delivered\u2014bragging and making snide remarks\u2014was the problem. \n\nIn summary, while the author has a valid reason to be affected by past bullying, their reaction was inappropriate. They took the opportunity to belittle someone else instead of handling the situation with maturity. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
