HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother they used to bully in high school.\n\nFirst, from the description, the author had a tough time in high school being bullied, especially by this girl. Then they turned their life around and achieved success. When they met her again, she was a single mom struggling as a waitress. The author, in a drunken state, started bragging about their 6-figure income and made a comment about being glad she's suffering. Their friends called them an asshole, but they're questioning if it's justified because of the past.\n\nSo, the key points here are the context of past bullying and the current situation. The author might feel some vindication because of the past treatment, but that doesn't necessarily justify being cruel now. Even if someone has a history of being mean, it's still wrong to take pleasure in their current struggles. The author's actions were hurtful, especially considering she was a single mom, which is already a tough situation. Bragging about their success and saying they don't feel sorry for her could be seen as rubbing it in, which is unkind.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they had to confront their past and maybe even wanted to show that they've overcome their hardships. However, the way they did it was inappropriate. The fact that they felt good about her suffering is a red flag. Empathy and kindness are important, even towards those who have wronged you. The situation isn't as simple as justifying revenge because the person's current struggles don't equate to deserved punishment for past actions. It's possible she's facing her own challenges now.\n\nThe author could have chosen to be supportive or at least neutral. Bragging and being dismissive adds to the emotional burden of someone already in a difficult position. Also, since they were drunk, it might have lowered their inhibitions, but that's not an excuse for unkind behavior. The friends' reaction suggests that they think the author overstepped, and the question is whether the author was justified.\n\nIn conclusion, even though there's context of past mistreatment, the author's actions were unkind and justified in taking pleasure in someone else's suffering. So, the answer is A.\n"
