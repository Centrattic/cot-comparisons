HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation involves someone (the author) bragging about their success to a former bully who is now in a tough spot, a struggling single mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied in high school by another person, \"Douchebag,\" which affected them until they turned 18. Then, in university, the author improved their life, got into a good job, etc. When they meet again, the author is drunk and starts bragging about their success, even saying they don't feel sorry for the other person and are glad she's suffering. The friends think the author was an asshole, but the author feels justified because of the past bullying.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. The answer should be A or B. \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Is it okay to confront a former bully about their struggles? Well, maybe the author has some justified resentment. But when they meet, the other person didn't recognize them, and when they spoke, the author took the opportunity to belittle her. Even though the author had a hard time before, does that justify being mean now? \n\nAlso, the author was drunk and the comment was pretty harsh. The act of rubbing success in someone's face, especially when they are struggling, is generally considered rude or inconsiderate. Even if there was past bullying, the way the author reacted might be seen as cruel. The author's friends called them an asshole, which is a social cue. \n\nBut then, the author's feelings might be valid. They were bullied and now feel vindicated. However, acting on those feelings in a hurtful way doesn't make it right. It's possible the author is not wrong because of past trauma, but from a societal standpoint, their actions were mean and potentially hurtful. \n\nThe key question is whether the author's actions were appropriate given the context. While the past bullying is a factor, the response of bragging and gloating isn't a socially acceptable way to address past wrongs. People might argue that the author should have handled it differently, maybe by not bringing up the past or being more empathetic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But generally, if someone is in a position to help or show empathy, even if they have past issues, being cruel isn't justified. The author's satisfaction in the other's suffering is more of a personal issue, but in terms of social behavior, it's considered wrong to gloat. \n\nSo, probably answer A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions were hurtful and not a mature response to past issues. Even if they have a history, the way they acted was inappropriate.\n"
