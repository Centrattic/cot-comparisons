HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, especially someone they had a history with. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The author had a tough time in high school, being bullied by this girl. Now, he's successful, and he runs into her when she's not doing well. He's drunk, starts bragging about his 6-figure job, and ends up being pretty harsh, saying he doesn't feel sorry for her and is glad she's suffering. His friends called him a huge asshole, but he thinks it's justified because of the past.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author's actions: he took the chance to confront her with his success, maybe to get some closure or vent his feelings. But was it appropriate? The woman is a single mom, struggling. The author's behavior could come off as cruel, especially in a vulnerable moment. Even if there was past bullying, does that justify being mean now?\n\nAlso, the author felt good that she was suffering. That might indicate some vindictiveness. People generally don't like to see others suffer, even if they were mean before. However, some might argue that the author had the right to express his feelings, but the way he did it was inconsiderate.\n\nBut the situation is complicated. The woman didn't recognize him at first, started a friendly conversation. He then turned it into a brag session. That's a shift in tone. Even if drunk, he knew her situation and chose to rub it in. That's probably where the wrong comes in. It's not about justice, more about rubbing past pain in someone's face when they're already struggling. \n\nAlso, the author's friends called him an asshole, which is a red flag. Even if he felt justified, actions have consequences. Maybe he needed to process his past, but doing it to her face in that way was inappropriate. So, in terms of social norms, bragging and taking pleasure in someone's misfortune is generally looked down upon. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
