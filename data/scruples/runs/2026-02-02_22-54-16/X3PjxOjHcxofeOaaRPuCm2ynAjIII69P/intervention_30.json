HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now a struggling single mom. They were bullied in high school, had a rough time, and now have a successful life. They ran into the person who bullied them, who's now a waitress with two kids, and the author bragged about their success, even going as far as saying they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. The author feels justified but is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a history of being bullied, which is serious. The bully, \"douchebag,\" targeted them for years, and the author endured that. Now, seeing her in a tough spot, the author's reaction is to boast about their own success. The question is whether this makes them an asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the author was hurt in the past. It's natural to feel some vindication or satisfaction when someone who wronged you is struggling. The author might feel that this is a form of closure. They might believe that the bully got what she deserved, especially if they think her actions led to her current situation. The author could be acting on a desire for some form of justice, even if it's not formal.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation is more complex. The bully's current state as a single mother might not be entirely her fault. Many factors can contribute to someone's life circumstances, and it's possible that her past actions aren't the sole reason for her struggles. By belittling her and taking pleasure in her misfortune, the author might be perpetuating a cycle of negativity. The way the author approached the conversation\u2014while drunk and being abrupt\u2014could be seen as insensitive. Even if there's a history, bringing up past pain in such a direct and harsh way can be unkind, especially when the person is already struggling.\n\nAlso, the author's friends reacted negatively, calling them an asshole. While friends might have their own biases, it's worth considering that social norms generally frown upon gloating, even if someone has a painful history. The author's statement \"I don't feel sorry for you and I'm glad you are having a shit time\" is particularly harsh. It's a direct expression of Schadenfreude, which is generally viewed negatively in social contexts. People might argue that while the author has the right to feel however they want, expressing such a sentiment directly to someone, especially in a vulnerable moment, is inconsiderate and harmful.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author mentions they needed to \"get it out of my system,\" implying some emotional release. But even if the intent is to express their feelings, the method might be inappropriate. It's possible to acknowledge past hurt without actively causing further emotional pain to the person who caused it. The author could have chosen a different way to process their emotions, perhaps through talking to a friend or therapist rather than confronting the person in person.\n\nMoreover, the author's success after their difficult time is commendable. It's a testament to their resilience and growth. However, this doesn't necessarily justify their actions towards the former bully. Success doesn't inherently give someone the right to humiliate others, even those who wronged them in the past.\n\nIn summary, while the author has a valid history of being wronged, their response of gloating and expressing no sympathy might be seen as inconsiderate and unkind. The context of their past is important, but social norms and ethical considerations often prioritize empathy and kindness, even towards those who have caused pain. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation.\n"
