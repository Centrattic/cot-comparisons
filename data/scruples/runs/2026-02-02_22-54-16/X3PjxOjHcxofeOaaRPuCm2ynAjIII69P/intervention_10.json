HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves someone who used to be bullied by a girl named Douchebag, who is now struggling as a single mother. The author saw her, got into a conversation, and then proceeded to brag about their success while the other person was clearly in a worse situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied for a long time, which probably caused a lot of emotional damage. Now seeing their former bully in a worse position, they feel a sense of schadenfreude. But is that justified?\n\nThe key points here are the actions taken. The author was drunk, which might have lowered their inhibitions. They bragged about their success, which can be seen as rubbing salt in the wound. Even if they felt justified because of past bullying, the way they handled the situation was hurtful. The other person didn't recognize them initially and seemed to be friendly, so the author's response could have been uninvited and cruel.\n\nAlso, the friends' reactions suggest that the author's behavior was inappropriate. The author says they felt good that she was suffering, but that's a personal feeling. The question is whether that feeling justifies their actions. Even if someone has been wronged, taking pleasure in another's misfortune and making them feel worse is generally considered inconsiderate and rude. \n\nMoreover, the author might have overstepped by making a public display of their success in a private conversation. Even if there's context, the way they expressed their feelings was tactless. The fact that they were drunk doesn't excuse it, as they should still be mindful of their actions towards others. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a history of being bullied, their actions in this moment were hurtful and unkind. Taking pleasure in someone else's suffering, even if they were a past bully, isn't acceptable behavior. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
