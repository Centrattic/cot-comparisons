HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 27-year-old man who has a high-paying job and is engaged. He had a tough time in high school being bullied, especially by a girl he calls \"douchebag.\" After university, he improved his life, changed his appearance, and now has a good career. When they meet again in a nightclub, she doesn't recognize him, but he does. She seems to be struggling as a single mom, working as a waitress. The author gets drunk and starts bragging about his success, then tells her he doesn't feel sorry for her and is glad she's suffering. His friends think he was a jerk, but he's wondering if it's justified.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's past experiences and his current reaction. He was bullied and now sees the person who did that to him in a worse position. The problem is the way he reacted\u2014bragging and then being cruel. Even if it's justified in his mind, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not whether his feelings are understandable.\n\nBullying is a serious issue. The girl's past behavior was harmful, and the author was the victim. However, when they meet again, the author chooses to taunt her instead of showing empathy or even just being polite. While he might have been hurt in the past, lashing out in that moment, especially while drunk, is considered rude or inconsiderate. It's one thing to feel a sense of justice or vindication, but another to act on it in a way that humiliates someone else.\n\nThe author's actions were a direct attack on her current situation, which is a low point for her. Even if he's not the one bullying her now, his words could have been hurtful. It's important to consider that everyone's circumstances are different. She might be a single mother with her own struggles, which the author might not fully understand. The act of letting out his anger, even after a long time, might not be fair because it's not about her past behavior towards him, but her current struggles.\n\nAlso, the author's friends called him a huge asshole, which suggests that social norms consider his behavior wrong. But the author is conflicted because he feels justified. The line between justified feelings and appropriate action is thin. While he has every right to feel happy about his own success, expressing it in a way that mocks another person's hardship is generally seen as wrong.\n\nSo, even though the context is there of past bullying, the immediate action of the author was to brag and then express schadenfreude. That's probably the wrong thing to do. It doesn't help the situation, and can be seen as cruel regardless of his past. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
