HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a tough time in high school being bullied by a girl, \"Douchebag.\" Now, after succeeding in life, they run into her again. She's struggling as a single mother, and while they're talking, the author starts bragging about their success and then says they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. The friends think the author was a jerk, but the author feels justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a victim of bullying and has overcome that to succeed. But then, when they meet the person who bullied them, now in a worse situation, they use the opportunity to boast and express schadenfreude. \n\nIs it okay to feel happy that someone who hurt you is struggling? Emotionally, that makes sense. People often feel that when someone they've had a negative relationship with faces difficulties. But the issue here is how they expressed those feelings. The author was drunk and confrontational, which isn't a good excuse, but it's part of the context.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author act in a way that's wrong, even if they felt justified? Bragging about your success when someone else is down, especially someone who wronged you, can come off as cruel. Even if the person deserves it, intentionally hurting someone's feelings isn't right. The author's friends called them an asshole, which adds to the idea that their actions were socially unacceptable.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they had the right to feel that way because of past mistreatment. But society usually frowns upon taking pleasure in others' misfortunes, even if they were mean to you. The way they delivered the message was harsh, and even if the person was a bully, being disrespectful when they're vulnerable isn't justified.\n\nAnother angle: the author was drunk. That might reduce responsibility slightly, but it's not an excuse for bad behavior. People are generally expected to maintain some level of respect regardless of their state. Also, the author's statement about not feeling sorry and being glad she's suffering is pretty direct and harmful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. While their feelings might be understandable, acting on them in that way is wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
