HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who used to bully them. Hmm. First, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author had a tough time in high school, being bullied by this girl. Now, they're successful, and they run into her again. She's struggling, and he ends up bragging about his success while she's a waitress with two kids. He was drunk and said some pretty harsh stuff, then felt good about her suffering. His friends call him an asshole, but he's unsure if he's justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are: past bullying, current success vs. her current struggles, the act of bragging and being harsh, and the emotional state of both parties. The author might feel justified because of the past, but does that make it okay?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone has been a bully, retaliating or rubbing it in isn't considered right. People often say that holding onto resentment isn't healthy. Also, the author was drunk, which might have lowered his inhibitions, but that's not an excuse for hurtful behavior. The woman is now in a vulnerable position as a single mother, and his comments could have hurt her feelings or added to her stress.\n\nThe author's friends called him an asshole, which suggests that social norms consider his actions inappropriate. Even if he felt the need to \"get it out of his system,\" the way he did it was harmful. There's also the aspect of empathy\u2014considering her current situation rather than focusing on past grievances. \n\nBut maybe there's a defense in terms of emotional release. However, the impact of his words on her is important. Bragging in that context can be seen as cruel, regardless of past issues. The fact that he felt good about her suffering might indicate a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, even though there's context, the act of rubbing past bullying into someone's face when they're struggling is generally considered wrong. The author's actions were hurtful, and while his past experiences contributed, it doesn't justify his behavior. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
