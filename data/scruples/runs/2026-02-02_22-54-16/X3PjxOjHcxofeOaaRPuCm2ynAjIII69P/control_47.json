HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who used to be bullied by another person and then, upon meeting that person again, brags about their success while the other person is struggling. The key points here are context, intent, and the impact of the action.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they were heavily bullied in the past by this woman, which had a significant negative impact on them. That's important because it adds context to their feelings. However, the situation now is that the author is in a good position, and the other person is struggling as a single mother. The author, while drunk, brags about their success and says they don't feel sorry for the other person because they think she's suffering.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were justified given their past. On one hand, the author had a history of being wronged, which might make them feel justified in their actions. On the other hand, the way they responded\u2014especially while drunk, and in a public setting like a nightclub\u2014could be seen as cruel or insensitive. The author's friends called them an asshole, which might indicate that the actions were socially unacceptable.\n\nThe author's justification is that they \"needed to get it out of my system,\" implying that they felt some catharsis. But even with that, the act of actively pointing out the other person's struggles and expressing a desire to see them suffer could be harmful. Also, the fact that the author admits to feeling good that the other person is suffering suggests a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. \n\nIt's also important to consider that the other person was in a vulnerable position. As a single mother, she's dealing with her own challenges, and the author's behavior might have compounded her difficulties. Even if there was a history of bullying, taking pleasure in someone else's suffering is generally considered negative. \n\nThe author's approach could be seen as a form of revenge, which is often frowned upon in social contexts. People usually advocate for forgiveness and empathy, even when they've been wronged. The author's actions might not directly cause harm, but they contribute to a toxic environment and could hurt someone who is already struggling. \n\nIn terms of the debate between A and B, the options are whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Given the analysis, the author's actions, while perhaps understandable in context, are still harmful and socially inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
