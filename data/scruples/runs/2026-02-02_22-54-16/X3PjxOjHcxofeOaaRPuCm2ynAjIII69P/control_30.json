HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for bragging about their success to a struggling single mother who used to bully them.\n\nFirst, let's look at the context. The author had a hard time in high school being bullied by this girl, which affected them a lot. They worked through that, went to university, improved their life, and now they're successful. When they meet the girl again, she's in a tough spot, a single mom struggling. The author, maybe feeling some old resentment, starts bragging about their success, and even says they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. They were drunk, but that's not really an excuse.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author had a history of being bullied, which is valid and painful. But when they meet their former bully, who's now in a tough situation, they don't just hold their peace but instead use the opportunity to belittle and boast. Even if they were processing past hurt, the way they handled it was confrontational and hurtful. \n\nThe friends called them an asshole, which is a common reaction. People generally don't appreciate someone gloating, especially in a vulnerable moment. Also, the author admits they felt good that the other person was suffering. That's a red flag. Taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune is a sign of schadenfreude, which is generally seen as unkind.\n\nBut there's context too. The author was drunk, which might have lowered their inhibitions. However, context doesn't always excuse behavior. They had the chance to show empathy and maybe even offer support, but instead chose to highlight their own success in a way that made the other person feel worse. \n\nThe fact that the former bully didn't recognize the author initially and seemed mature and happy to see them suggests she might have genuinely changed. The author's response could have ruined that positive interaction. Even if the author had unresolved feelings, acting on them in such a way is inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of morality, while understandable that someone might feel resentment, the appropriate response isn't to rub past pain in someone's face, especially when they're already struggling. The author's actions could be seen as petty and unkind. They might need to process their feelings but not at the expense of another person's dignity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inappropriate. They had a chance to move past the hurt but instead chose to escalate it. Even if they felt justified, the method of expressing their feelings was wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
