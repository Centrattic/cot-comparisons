HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's think about this situation. The person who wrote this (let's call them the author) had a tough high school experience where they were bullied by a girl named \"Douchebag.\" Fast forward, the author now has a good job, is engaged, and their life looks great. They run into this girl again, who is a struggling single mother. The author, after some drinks, starts bragging about their success and even says they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering.\n\nHmm, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author feels justified because of past bullying, but others say they were an asshole. So, where's the line here?\n\nFirst, there's the issue of bragging. Even if someone has a good life, gloating about it in front of someone who's struggling might be insensitive. The author mentions they were drunk, but that's not really an excuse. Being drunk doesn't negate the impact of their words, especially if they remember doing it.\n\nThen there's the part where they say they feel good that the other person is suffering. That's a bit of a red flag. Even if someone wronged you in the past, taking pleasure in their misfortune can come off as vindictive. The author might feel justified because of past harm, but that doesn't make it right. People grow and change, and maybe the girl wasn't the same person she was back then.\n\nAlso, the author's friends called them an asshole, which is a sign that their actions were socially unacceptable. The friends\u2019 reaction suggests that the author overstepped. The line between expressing one's feelings and being cruel is thin here. The author should have considered the other person's current situation more compassionately.\n\nBut wait, the author did mention they were just letting out their feelings. Maybe they felt wronged and wanted to express that. However, the way they did it\u2014publicly, in a place where the other person might feel humiliated\u2014was probably not the right approach. Empathy is key here. Even if the past interactions were negative, the author could have acknowledged their success without belittling the other person.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions were inconsiderate and taken to an extreme. They crossed a line by taking pleasure in someone else's suffering, even if they had past grievances. So, the answer is A (they are in the wrong).\n"
