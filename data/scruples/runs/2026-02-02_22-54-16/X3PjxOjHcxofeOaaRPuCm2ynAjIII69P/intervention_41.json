HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author bragged to a former bully, who is now a struggling single mom, about his own success while subtly putting her down. The context is that the bully had been cruel to the author in high school, and now he's seeing her in a worse position.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was bullied by this girl for years, which probably left emotional scars. When they reconnect, he's in a better position financially and socially. He uses the encounter as an opportunity to vent his feelings, even though he's drunk. The friends call him an asshole, but he's uncertain if it's justified because he feels the need to release his pent-up emotions.\n\nNow, I have to think about the ethics here. Bullying is a serious issue, and it's natural for someone who was bullied to feel a range of emotions when seeing their bully later in life. However, the way the author expressed his feelings might be problematic. He didn't just mention his success but used it to belittle her, which could be seen as cruel. Even though he had a reason, intentionally making someone feel worse, especially when they're already struggling, is generally considered inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the author admits that he felt good knowing she was suffering. This suggests that his actions were driven by a desire for some form of emotional validation or revenge, which might not be the healthiest response. While he has a history of being bullied, the act of rubbing success in someone's face, even if they were a bully, isn't typically seen as acceptable behavior. People usually value empathy and kindness, even towards former adversaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions might be more understandable given his past. He was hurt and might have felt a need to assert his current status to feel better about himself. But does that justify his actions? Maybe not. The appropriate way to handle such feelings might be to address them privately rather than confront the person in a public or hurtful manner.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were unkind and could be seen as inconsiderate, even if there's a history. The key is whether the actions were wrong. The answer likely leans towards A, meaning the author is in the wrong, because he took the opportunity to belittle someone who is struggling, even if there's a past context. It's about how we treat others, regardless of their past actions towards us.\n"
