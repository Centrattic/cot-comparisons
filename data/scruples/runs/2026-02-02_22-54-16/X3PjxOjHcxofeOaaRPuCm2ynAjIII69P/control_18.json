HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a 27-year-old man who is successful now, and he encountered a former bully, a single mother who's struggling. He bragged about his success to her while they were at a nightclub, and he felt good that she was suffering. He's questioning if he's an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied in high school by this woman, which affected him deeply. He worked hard to improve his life, and when he sees her in a worse situation, he feels vindicated. However, the key here is how he expressed his feelings. Bragging and making derogatory remarks when someone is in a vulnerable position might be seen as cruel, regardless of past experiences.\n\nThe author mentions he was drunk, but that's not a valid excuse for his actions. People are still responsible for their behavior under the influence. He also says he felt good about her suffering, which could indicate a desire for schadenfreude rather than genuine empathy. Even if he had a hard past, intentionally rubbing his success in someone else's face, especially someone who is struggling, can be hurtful and inappropriate.\n\nThe other perspective is that the author had every right to feel happy with his own success and might have been releasing pent-up frustration. But the way he handled it was confrontational. The friends' reaction suggests that their social circle didn't approve of his behavior. The author's justification is that he needed to get it out, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the hurtful comments. \n\nIt's also important to consider the woman's current situation. She's a single mother facing challenges, and the author's comments might have added to her emotional burden. Even if she was a bully before, the author's response could be seen as unkind and lacking in compassion. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a history of being bullied and his success is hard-earned, his actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. The wrongness lies in how he expressed his feelings rather than the feelings themselves. Therefore, the answer is likely A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
