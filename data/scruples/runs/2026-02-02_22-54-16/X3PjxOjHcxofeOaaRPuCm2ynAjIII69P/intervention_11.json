HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who used to be bullied and is now successful, and they met an old bully who's struggling. The author then bragged about their success and even said some harsh things while drunk. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied in high school, which is a significant experience. They've worked hard to improve their life, lost weight, got a good job, and are now in a better place. When they saw the person who used to bully them, they were in a night club setting. The woman (dubbed \"Douchebag\") didn't recognize the author at first but then started talking. The author shared their success, and when asked about the woman's situation, the author started to brag and even made a harsh comment about not feeling sorry for her.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's actions and their justification. The author admits they were drunk and that they felt a sense of satisfaction that the bully was suffering. They also mention that they felt they needed to \"get it out of their system.\" Their friends called them a huge asshole, but they think their friends don't understand the context.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to assess the ethics of their actions. Even though there's a history of bullying, does that justify bragging and being cruel in the moment? The author was in a position of power now, and their comments could be seen as taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune. That's generally considered unkind. Also, the person they're talking to might be in a vulnerable state, and the author's words could have been hurtful.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of past trauma. The author was a victim and might have unresolved feelings. However, even if someone has been wronged, does that mean they can act unkindly in return? There's a line between seeking closure and being unkind. The author's behavior seems to cross that line, especially since they were aware that their comments were making the other person upset.\n\nAnother angle is the social setting. The author was in a nightclub with friends, and the comment was made in a moment of drunkenness. While the context of past bullying is important, the way the author handled the encounter might not be the healthiest or most constructive. Instead of confronting the past in a mature way, they chose to belittle the other person.\n\nSo, considering all this, while the author's history is valid and their feelings are understandable, the action of taunting someone who's struggling, even if they were a bully in the past, is not acceptable. The author's satisfaction in the other person's suffering is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
