HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who had a tough time in high school being bullied by this girl called Douchebag, later meets her when they're both adults. The author is now successful and sees that Douchebag is struggling as a single mom. During their conversation, the author brags about their success and ends up making Douchebag upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied for a long time, so there's a history of negative emotions. When they meet again, the author is in a better position. The key points here are the intentions and the impact of the author's actions.\n\nThe author was drunk and might have been trying to vent their feelings. But bragging about someone else's misfortunes, even if they were a bully before, can be seen as cruel. Even if the author had a hard time before, it doesn't justify making someone else feel worse now. People can have different paths; maybe Douchebag is facing her own challenges. The author's comment about not feeling sorry and being glad she's suffering seems harsh. \n\nAlso, the author's friends called them an asshole, which suggests that their actions were socially inappropriate. The author might be seeking validation or closure, but the way they handled it was confrontational. It's important to consider empathy here. Even if someone was a bully, it's not right to gloat over their struggles. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a valid history of being treated badly. Maybe they felt a need to assert their current position or perhaps they were still holding onto old feelings. However, the method of expressing those feelings was hurtful. The author might not have intended to be mean, but the effect was negative. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a backstory that adds context, the act of bragging and expressing enjoyment in someone else's suffering is generally considered wrong. It's about how we treat others regardless of past interactions. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
