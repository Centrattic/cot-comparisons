HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who is now struggling. The situation involves a lot of context, so I need to consider both sides carefully.\n\nFirst, the author had a rough time in high school being bullied by this woman. They worked hard in university to improve their life and now have a successful career. When they meet again, the author feels a mix of emotions, especially since the former bully is now in a tough spot. The key points here are the bragging and the blunt comment about not feeling sorry for her.\n\nThe author was drunk and maybe let their emotions get the best of them. They might have been trying to confront past pain, but their approach was confrontational. Even if the former bully was a bully, she's a single mom now, which adds complexity. The author's friends called them an asshole, which suggests that their actions were socially unaccepted.\n\nThe author's justification is that they needed to \"get it out of their system.\" But is that a valid reason to hurt someone else, even if they were a past bully? It's one thing to move on from past trauma and another to take a personal pleasure in someone else's suffering. The line between catharsis and cruelty can be thin here.\n\nAlso, the comment about not feeling sorry and being glad she's suffering could be seen as vindictive. Even if the author had a hard time, the way they expressed it was hurtful and condescending. The fact that the woman was a waitress and struggling doesn't justify the author's behavior, especially when she seemed to show maturity and kindness in their conversation.\n\nIn terms of social ethics, people generally expect empathy, even for those who have wronged them. The author's actions might be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable moment. The bragging could be hurtful, regardless of the context. While everyone has past wounds, acting out in a way that harms others, even if they were a bully, is usually considered wrong.\n\nSo considering all factors, the author acted inconsiderately, even if they had a motive. The right approach would have been to acknowledge their past but focus on their own success without belittling someone else's current struggles. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
