HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging about their success to a struggling single mother who used to bully them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a tough time in high school, bullied by someone named Douchebag. Now, they've turned their life around with a good job and other benefits. They meet this person again, who's struggling as a single mother. The author, drunk, starts bragging about their success and even says they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering.\n\nThe author's friends called them an asshole, but they feel justified because of past bullying. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The author's actions were in response to past bullying. But when they met again, the situation was different. The person was in a vulnerable position as a struggling parent. The author took the opportunity to belittle her, which could be seen as mean-spirited. Even though the author had a history of being bullied, does that justify the behavior now?\n\nAlso, the author admitted they felt good that she was suffering. That's a red flag. Taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune, especially when they're vulnerable, is generally considered unethical. The bragging might have been an attempt to assert superiority, but it's not a healthy way to handle past trauma. It could be seen as revenge, which is often frowned upon.\n\nThe author's friends disapproved, which might indicate that their actions were socially unacceptable. Even if the author was drunk, that doesn't excuse the behavior. The intent to hurt or show off could still be deliberate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could be dealing with unresolved issues from the past. But that doesn't make the current actions right. There's a difference between feeling justified and actually being right. The situation might require empathy and understanding rather than gloating.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions likely crossed a line. They used a moment of vulnerability to assert their own success in a way that was hurtful. Even if there's a history, the response wasn't appropriate and could be considered inconsiderate and cruel. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
