HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother. The author used to be bullied by this person, and now, seeing her in a worse position, he brags about his success when they meet. He was drunk and his friends called him out for being an asshole. The author feels justified because of the past bullying, but he's unsure if his actions were wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the context of past bullying and the current situation. The author had a rough time in high school due to her bullying. Now, years later, he's successful and she's struggling. He confronts her, bragging during their interaction. The question is whether this makes him the asshole.\n\nI need to consider the ethical implications. Even if someone was a bully in the past, is it acceptable to taunt them when they're in a vulnerable position? The author was drunk, which might reduce his responsibility but doesn't eliminate it. The woman didn't recognize him initially, and he started the conversation. He brought up her struggles and made her feel worse. \n\nThe author's friends called him an asshole, which is a social judgment. The author's defense is that he felt justified because of past experiences. However, revenge or gloating isn't typically seen as acceptable behavior, even if someone has wronged you. Empathy is important here; she's a single mother with kids, struggling. Even if she was a bully, she might not deserve to be mocked in her current situation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling good that she's suffering. This suggests a lack of empathy, which is a red flag. Even if someone has been unkind, it's generally considered wrong to wish them harm or take pleasure in their misfortune. \n\nThe situation is complicated by the past context, but the immediate action of bragging and making her feel worse in a vulnerable moment is problematic. The author's actions caused her visible upset, which is a clear negative outcome. \n\nSo, while there's context of past bullying, the act of gloating is still inconsiderate and harmful. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
