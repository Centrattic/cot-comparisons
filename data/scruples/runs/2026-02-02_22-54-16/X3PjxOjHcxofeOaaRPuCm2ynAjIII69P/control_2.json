HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves someone who was bullied in the past and then, upon reuniting with their bully, bragged about their success while the other person is struggling. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a victim of bullying, which is a serious issue. The bully, now a single mother facing difficulties, was approached by the author who is now successful. The author admits to bragging and making hurtful comments when drunk.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author felt justified because of past mistreatment, but does that make their actions okay? Even if someone has been wronged, retaliating or gloating can be seen as unkind. The author's friends called them an asshole, which is a social judgment. The question is whether the author's actions are morally wrong despite their personal history.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges feeling good that the other person is suffering. This suggests a desire for some form of retribution or schadenfreude, which is generally viewed negatively. While the past bullying is a valid context, it doesn't necessarily excuse the behavior. People are often encouraged to rise above cycles of negativity, even if it's hard.\n\nMoreover, the situation happened when the author was drunk. While that might mitigate intent, it doesn't eliminate responsibility. The impact on the other person was negative, and the author's actions could be seen as unkind and petty. \n\nIn terms of morality, most ethical frameworks would advise against taking pleasure in others' misfortunes, regardless of past interactions. So, the author's actions, while understandable from a personal standpoint, are likely in the wrong because they contributed to hurting someone else, even if that person was previously unkind.\n"
