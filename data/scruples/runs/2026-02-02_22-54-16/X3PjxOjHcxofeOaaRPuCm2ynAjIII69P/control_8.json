HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother, specifically an old bully from his past.\n\nFirst, context is important. The author had a rough time in high school being bullied by this woman. He worked hard, improved his life, and now is successful. When they meet again, he's drunk and starts bragging about his success, making her uncomfortable. His friends call him an asshole for it, but he feels justified because of past experiences.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author was a victim of bullying, which is valid. However, responding with pride in someone else's suffering isn't generally considered acceptable. Even if there's a history, taking pleasure in her current struggles crosses a line. The situation involves a vulnerable person\u2014a single mother working as a waitress. The author's comments could come off as cruel, especially when she's already struggling. Being drunk might mitigate intent but doesn't excuse the behavior. The friends' reaction suggests that his actions were socially inappropriate. While he might feel justified, the impact on the other person matters. The question is whether his actions were wrong. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, taking joy in another's misfortune is considered unkind, regardless of past interactions. The author's behavior, even if born from past pain, is not a socially acceptable response. So, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the action was hurtful and unkind, despite his motivations.\n"
