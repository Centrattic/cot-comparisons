HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The person in question bragged to a former bully who's struggling as a single mother. The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was bullied by this woman during their teenage years, leading to significant emotional pain. Now, they've turned their life around, but when they meet again, the author brags about their success and expresses satisfaction that the bully is struggling. They were drunk, which might affect their judgment, but intent matters here.\n\nThe key points are the author's intent and the impact of their words. The woman didn't recognize the author first, so the interaction wasn't premeditated. The author was drunk, which could be a factor, but it's not an excuse. They felt justified in their actions because of past bullying, but does that justify making someone else feel worse?\n\nThe woman is a single mother facing her own struggles. The author's comments were hurtful and could be seen as rubbing salt in a wound. Even if the author felt a sense of closure or justified, the effect on the other person is important. The woman might have moved on and was trying to be polite, but the author's response was harsh and insensitive.\n\nAlso, the author's friends called them an asshole, which adds social context. The author claims they needed to \"get it out of their system,\" but that doesn't negate the harm caused. The author's satisfaction in the woman's suffering is problematic because it's about personal validation rather than genuine support.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, while past trauma can influence behavior, actively causing harm to someone else, even if they were previously unkind, isn't acceptable. The author's actions were hurtful and took advantage of the woman's vulnerable situation. So, the conclusion is that the author is in the wrong for their insensitive and vindictive remarks, regardless of their past experiences.\n"
