HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now a struggling single mom.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was bullied by this woman (dubbed \"douchebag\") in high school. The author has since turned their life around, securing a high-paying job and a good lifestyle. They met this person years later, and during a conversation, the author started bragging about their success while the woman was working as a waitress and struggling with two kids. The author even said they don't feel sorry for her and are glad she's suffering. The friends called them an asshole, but the author feels justified.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions make them the asshole. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone has been a bully in the past, it doesn't necessarily justify treating them poorly as an adult. The woman might have changed, and the author's behavior could be seen as cruel, especially given her current situation as a struggling single mother. The author was drunk, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. Also, feeling good about someone else's suffering is generally considered a negative trait. \n\nWhile the author had a history of being bullied, taking pleasure in another person's misfortune, even if they were a past bully, is typically frowned upon in society. It's possible the woman has faced her own challenges since high school and is trying to make the best of her situation. The author's bragging and lack of empathy could be seen as unnecessarily harsh, regardless of past interactions. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author had built up resentment over years and it was a moment of emotional release. However, this doesn't make the action right. The key here is the lack of empathy and the deliberate act of making someone feel worse, especially when they are already in a vulnerable position. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong for their behavior.\n"
