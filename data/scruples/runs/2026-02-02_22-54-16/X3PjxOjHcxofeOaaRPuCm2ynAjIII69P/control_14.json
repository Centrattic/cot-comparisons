HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author mentions a past where he was bullied by a girl named \"douchebag\" during high school. He's now successful, and when he meets her again, she's a single mom struggling. He brags about his 6-figure job while she's a waitress, and he says he's glad she's suffering. His friends call him an asshole, but he feels justified because of her past behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are: past bullying, current success versus her current struggles, the act of bragging, and the emotional reaction.\n\nFirst, the context of bullying is important. She did wrong by bullying him, which is hurtful. But now, he's in a position to gloat. The question is whether that's acceptable. Even if she was a bully before, does that give him the right to mock her current situation?\n\nBragging in this context, especially when she's in a vulnerable position as a struggling parent, seems insensitive. He was drunk, which might affect his judgment, but that's not a complete excuse. People are responsible for their actions even when drunk, especially if they're aware of their words.\n\nHe mentions feeling good that she's suffering. That's a clear sign of schadenfreude, which is generally frowned upon. While past harm might influence feelings, acting on those feelings to hurt someone else isn't considered right in most moral frameworks. The author's actions could be seen as rubbing salt in the wound, which isn't helpful or kind.\n\nAlso, the interaction seems one-sided. She was mature, happy to see him, and showed goodwill. His response was to belittle her situation. Even if he needed to release some pent-up anger, the way he did it was inappropriate and hurtful.\n\nThe friends' reaction that he's being an asshole supports that. It's important to consider empathy here. Despite her past actions, she's a person facing her own struggles now. The author's response lacks compassion and perpetuates negativity instead of moving past the old conflict.\n\nSo, even though the initial bullying was wrong, the author's current actions in gloating and being unsympathetic are in the wrong. The justification based on past harm doesn't excuse the present behavior. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
