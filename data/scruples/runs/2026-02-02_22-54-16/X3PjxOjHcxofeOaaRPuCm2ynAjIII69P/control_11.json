HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now struggling. The author, who went from being bullied to successful, met this person again and used the opportunity to boast about his achievements while making her feel worse. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation, the key points are: the author confronted someone who had bullied him in the past, and during a social interaction, he boasted about his success while she was in a tough spot. Even though he's not in the wrong for being successful, the way he handled the interaction might be problematic.\n\nThe user is asking for a judgment between A (author is wrong) and B (not wrong). The challenge here is understanding the context of past bullying versus adult behavior. The author had a history of being bullied by this person, which might explain some of his feelings. However, the way he reacted\u2014especially when drunk\u2014was to belittle her current situation. \n\nThe author justified his actions by saying he needed to \"get it out of his system,\" implying that his past hurt justified his behavior. But this is a common defense for acting out in ways that aren't considerate. The issue is that even if someone has been wronged, retaliating in a public, humiliating manner isn't appropriate, especially when the person is vulnerable. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling good that she was suffering. This suggests a desire for revenge or schadenfreude, which is generally frowned upon in moral terms. While people might understand the emotional drive, acting on it in a hurtful way is considered wrong. \n\nThe friends' reaction that he was an \"asshole\" supports the idea that his actions were socially unacceptable. Even if there's context, the act of bragging and dismissing someone's struggles isn't excusable. The author should have considered her current situation and perhaps offered empathy instead, even if he felt justified.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions were hurtful and inappropriate, making answer A the correct choice.\n"
