HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging about their success to a struggling former bully. \n\nFirst, the context: The author had a hard time in high school being bullied by someone named Douchebag. After overcoming those challenges, they became successful. When they meet Douchebag again, now a single mom in a tough spot, they start bragging about their 6-figure job while she's a waitress. The author says they felt good that she's suffering and question if that's justified.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author was a victim of bullying, which is valid. They've worked to overcome their challenges, which is commendable. But when they meet their former bully, they use that opportunity to rub their success in her face. That's where the conflict lies.\n\nEven though the author was hurt before, does that justify their reaction? Bragging in someone else's face, especially when they're struggling, is generally considered unkind. The author was drunk, which might have lowered their inhibitions, but that's not a complete excuse. The friends' reaction of calling them a \"huge asshole\" suggests that social norms consider this behavior unacceptable. \n\nThe author's statement that they \"needed to get it out of their system\" might indicate unresolved feelings from past trauma. However, taking out past hurt on someone else in the present doesn't make it right. It's important to consider empathy here; even if Douchebag was a bully, she's now a struggling parent. The author's actions could be seen as lacking empathy and contributing to her current struggles. \n\nAlso, the author admits to feeling good that she's suffering, which might point to a desire for some form of retribution. But society generally frowns on taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune, regardless of past conflicts. \n\nSo, even with the context, the act of bragging in a situation where the other person is vulnerable is likely wrong. The author's actions crossed a line from justified closure to being cruel. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
