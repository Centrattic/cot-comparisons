HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now struggling as a single mom. The author had a hard time in high school, was bullied by this girl, and now after success, meets her again. He brags about his wealth and says he's glad she's suffering, especially when he's pretty drunk.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the context of past bullying, the current situation where the bully is struggling, and the author's actions during their meeting. The author justifies it as needing to get it out, feeling justified because of past experiences. But the question is whether this makes him in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: bragging about his success in a way that's hurtful. Even if he's drunk, that doesn't excuse being intentionally cruel. The woman might be struggling, and even if she was a bully before, treating someone with kindness is generally expected. The author's friends called him an asshole, which is a social judgment. The author admits he felt good about her suffering, which suggests a desire for schadenfreude or revenge, which is morally questionable.\n\nThe context is important. The bully did wrong in the past, but that doesn't give the author a free pass to act out now. People can change, and even if she didn't, the author's response could have been more compassionate. Plus, the woman was trying to be friendly initially, and his response was harsh. There's also the issue of using someone else's hardship as a way to feel better about oneself, which is self-centered.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a tough time and might be dealing with unresolved feelings. But that doesn't make his actions right. The key is whether his actions were justified. Even people who have been wronged are expected to act with some empathy. The author's behavior crossed a line by taunting someone in a vulnerable situation. So, the answer would be A (in the wrong) because his actions were cruel and unkind, regardless of past context.\n"
