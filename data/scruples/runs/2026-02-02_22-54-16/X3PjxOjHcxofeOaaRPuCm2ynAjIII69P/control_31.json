HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother. The situation is that the author was bullied by a girl named Douchebag in high school. Now, he's successful and runs into her again. She's a single mom, struggling, and he ends up bragging about his success while implying he's glad she's suffering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author was a victim of bullying, which is a serious issue. He's now in a better place and might feel a sense of vindication. But the key here is how he handled the situation. He was drunk and chose to confront her, even though she wasn't aware of his past. He didn't just mention his success; he took a jab at her current struggles, making her feel bad. That's where the problem lies.\n\nThe author's friends called him an asshole, and from a social standpoint, rubbing someone's misfortunes in their face is generally frowned upon. Even if he felt justified, it's not socially acceptable to gloat. People usually understand that past conflicts can leave scars, but how to address them matters. The author didn't apologize or show empathy; instead, he focused on his own success and her failure. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was drunk adds another layer. Being under the influence might have lowered his inhibitions, leading him to say things he wouldn't normally say. However, that doesn't excuse his behavior. He's still responsible for his actions, even if he was drunk. \n\nThe question of whether feeling good about someone else's suffering is justified is more about personal morality. But the act of expressing that feeling publicly, especially in a hurtful way, is where the social wrong comes in. The author might believe he has a right to feel that way, but the way he expressed it was inappropriate and unkind. \n\nMoreover, the woman in question might have matured, as she said she was pleased to see him. The author's response didn't acknowledge any of her positive growth, only her struggles. It's possible she might have her own challenges, but that doesn't mean he has the right to be cruel. \n\nIn terms of social norms, kindness and empathy are usually encouraged, even towards those who have wronged you. The author's behavior crossed that line. So, even though he has a history of being bullied, his response was unkind and vindictive. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions were unkind and he took advantage of her situation to brag, which is generally considered inappropriate.\n"
