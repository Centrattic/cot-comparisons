HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother who used to bully him. I need to think through this carefully.\n\nFirst, the author was bullied in high school by this girl, which is a significant context. He was overweight, had acne, and she was particularly cruel. He endured that until he left for university. Now, he's successful, and when he meets her again, she's in a tough spot as a single mom. He goes to a club with friends, sees her, and starts bragging about his success. He mentions his 6-figure job and basically says he doesn't feel sorry for her and is glad she's suffering. His friends call him an asshole, but he's unsure if his actions were justified because of past experiences.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, even though he has a history of being bullied, the way he approached the situation might be considered cruel. He took the opportunity to mock her current struggles, which is a sensitive time for her. Even if he's not in the wrong for feeling that way, the action of publicly humiliating her or bragging when she's vulnerable could be seen as inconsiderate. People often have complex emotions, and while he might have felt justified, the impact of his words on her could be harmful. It's important to consider empathy and how one's actions affect others, especially when they're in a vulnerable state. So, even with context, intentionally causing someone pain through bragging in their moment of struggle might make him the asshole here. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
