HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for bragging to a former bully who's now struggling. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had a tough time in high school being bullied by this girl, \"Douchebag.\" He felt he accepted his place in the hierarchy back then. Now, years later, he's successful, and when they meet again, he's drunk and starts bragging about his success while she's a struggling single mom. He even says he's glad she's suffering and doesn't feel sorry for her. His friends call him an asshole, but he's conflicted about whether his actions are justified given the past.\n\nSo, the key points here are: past bullying, current success vs. her struggles, the context of the meeting (he recognized her, she didn't at first), and his emotional state (drunk, maybe seeking catharsis). \n\nOn one hand, he's been hurt in the past, and maybe he felt a need to express his feelings or release pent-up emotions. But on the other hand, his actions were hurtful and dismissive, especially in a situation where she might be vulnerable. Even if he had a history with her, using their encounter to boast and mock her current situation seems inappropriate. The fact that he was drunk might make it more excusable in terms of not being his best judgment, but it doesn't necessarily make it right. \n\nAlso, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The author's defense is that he needed to \"get it out of his system,\" but that doesn't negate the impact of his words. People often say things in the moment that cause harm, even if they have a motive. The friends' reaction suggests that they saw it as harmful, and the author's own admission that he felt good about her suffering might indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal history. If someone has been wronged, there's a line between standing up for oneself and actively causing harm. The author didn't confront her about past bullying but instead used the meeting to highlight his success and her struggles. That could be seen as rubbing salt in the wound rather than addressing the past directly. \n\nAnother angle: the author might not be in the wrong if we consider that he's finally standing up for himself after years of being a target. But society generally values empathy and kindness, even towards those who have wronged us. The way he handled the situation was unkind, and even if he felt justified, the method was inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the author is in the wrong. His actions were hurtful and unkind, regardless of his past. While the context of bullying adds nuance, the way he responded was not constructive or empathetic. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
