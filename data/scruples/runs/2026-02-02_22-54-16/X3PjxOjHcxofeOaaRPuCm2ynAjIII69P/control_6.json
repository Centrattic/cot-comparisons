HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is now successful, meeting a former bully who's struggling. The author then brags about their success and makes a comment about not feeling sorry for the ex-bully.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a tough time in high school being bullied by this woman, which affected them deeply. Now, years later, they've turned their life around, while the ex-bully is in a difficult situation. The encounter happens when the author is drunk and maybe not thinking clearly.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact of the author's actions. The author felt justified in their comments because of past mistreatment. However, even if someone has a history of being bullied, does that justify belittling someone else who's now in a vulnerable situation? \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people often suggest that holding onto negative feelings and lashing out isn't healthy. The author's comment about being glad the ex-bully is suffering could be seen as schadenfreude, which is generally frowned upon because it takes pleasure in someone else's misfortune. The friends' reactions indicate that the author's actions were harsh and unkind.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the ex-bully's past behavior. The author had been a victim of bullying, which is serious. However, responding to past harm with present-day cruelty might not address the original issue and could perpetuate a cycle of negativity.\n\nAnother angle is the appropriateness of the situation. Bragging about one's success in the face of someone who is struggling, even if there's a history, can be insensitive. It might not help the author's healing either; instead, it could reinforce negative emotions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether intent and context matter. While the author's past is valid, their actions during the encounter were hurtful. The justification of \"venting\" might not excuse the behavior towards someone else in a difficult position.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, empathy and kindness are valued. Even if someone has been wronged, retaliating isn't considered acceptable. The author might not be in the \"wrong\" morally if they were processing their feelings, but socially and ethically, their actions were harmful. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A). They crossed a line by taking pleasure in someone else's suffering, regardless of past grievances. The friends' disapproval and the immediate negative impact on the ex-bully support this conclusion.\n"
