HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by bragging to a former bully who's now in a tough spot. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a rough time in high school with a girl who bullied him. Now, he's successful, and they meet again. The girl is struggling as a single mom. The author, while drunk, starts bragging about his success and says he's glad she's suffering.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author mentions that he felt justified because she was a bully. But he took the chance to rub his success in her face when she was already in a vulnerable situation. Even though he was drunk, intent matters. He knew who she was and her current situation. \n\nBragging in such a context could be seen as cruel. The person he's talking to is a single mother with two kids, working as a waitress. She might be going through a lot, and his comments could add to her stress. The fact that he felt \"good\" about her suffering suggests a lack of empathy, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, his friends called him an asshole, which adds social context. Even if he felt the need to express his past hurt, doing so in a way that's hurtful and degrading isn't acceptable. People usually aren't encouraged to take pleasure in others' misfortunes, even if those people were mean before. \n\nBut maybe there's some nuance. The author had been bullied and finally found success. The encounter might have triggered some unresolved feelings. However, the way he handled it was inappropriate. Instead of expressing his feelings constructively, he chose to belittle someone who's already struggling.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's generally wrong to gloat over someone else's hardships. Even if the person isn't a stranger, taking the opportunity to mock or brag can be seen as unkind and petty. The author might need to reflect on his behavior and consider how his actions affected the other person, regardless of past interactions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. He took advantage of the situation to boast and express vindictiveness, which isn't acceptable. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
