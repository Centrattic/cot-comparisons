HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bragging to a struggling single mother they used to bully. The situation has a lot of context.\n\nFirst, the author was bullied by this girl, \"Douchebag,\" in high school. She was mean to him, which affected him a lot. Then, he improved his life, got a good job, and when they met again, he found out she's a struggling single mom. He went to a club, recognized her, and started bragging about his success while she was a waitress with two kids.\n\nHe was drunk and said some harsh things, like not feeling sorry for her and being glad she's suffering. His friends called him an asshole, but he's unsure if he's justified because of the past.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, even though he was bullied, taking pleasure in her current struggles seems vindictive. Bragging and making her feel worse, especially when she's already in a tough spot, isn't kind. He might have unresolved feelings from the past, but confronting someone in that way, especially when they're vulnerable, isn't the right approach. It's about empathy here. Even if she was mean before, she's a parent now facing challenges. His actions were hurtful and unkind, so probably A, he's in the wrong.\n"
