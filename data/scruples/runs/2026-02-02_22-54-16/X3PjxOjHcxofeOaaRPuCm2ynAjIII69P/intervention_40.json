HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bragging about their success to a struggling single mother who had previously bullied them.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author was bullied in high school by this person, which caused them a lot of pain. They had a difficult time due to weight and acne, and this person was part of that. Now, years later, the author is successful, and they meet again when the former bully is struggling as a single mother. \n\nThe key points here are the author's actions. They decided to confront this person, which they didn't recognize at first. They started with a friendly conversation, then shifted to bragging about their own success, especially when drunk. The author's friends thought they were being an asshole. The author justifies it by saying they needed to get it out and feel justified because of past bullying.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the impact. The woman is now in a vulnerable position, and the author's comments likely hurt her. Even if the author had negative feelings, the way they expressed it was unkind and potentially cruel. The author mentions feeling good that she was suffering, which could indicate a desire for revenge or schadenfreude. That's a red flag. \n\nWhile there's a history of bullying, taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune is generally frowned upon. The author didn't address the past directly or offer support; instead, they belittled her current situation. The fact that they were drunk might be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't excuse the behavior. The friends' reaction that the author was an asshole is a sign that the social norm was violated. \n\nThe author's justification that they needed to \"get it out\" is a personal coping mechanism, but others might see it as insensitive. People can have complex emotions, but acting on them in a way that harms someone else, especially when they're struggling, is problematic. \n\nIn summary, while the author has a history with the person, their actions during the encounter were harmful and unkind. The desire for revenge or catharsis doesn't negate the negative impact on the other person. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
