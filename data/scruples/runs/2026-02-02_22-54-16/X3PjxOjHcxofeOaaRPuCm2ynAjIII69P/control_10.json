HOWEVER this was not always the case, in high school I was extremely overweight, had acne and was mercilessly bullied...even up until 18\n\nThere was one particular girl (we'll call her douchebag), who was particuarly mean spirited to me. She would always make fun of my looks and call me a virgin, etc. She did not stop, and I just accepted my 'place' within the hierarchy. This happened up until 18, and that was the last time I saw her...\n\nIn university, I blossomed, I lost the weight and acne was taken care of, and I definitely had a lot more luck with girls. I also graduated with a good degree. My uni years were FAR better than my school years.\n\nNow I have seen how Douchebag ended up...she ended up aging pretty fast (she looks twice her age) and becoming a single mother to two kids, needless to say, she IS struggling in life. And when I went back to my hometown, I actually saw her on a night out (went to a nightclub) when I went with my friends...she didn't recognize me but I recognized her, and we started speaking.\n\nShe seemed more mature and pleased to see me, asked how I was doing, I told her how my life turned out well and she said it was great to see me and that I looked great. She said she was glad that I'm doing well, I then started to ask what job she has and she starts to say she's a waitress and she's struggling, etc.\n\nThis is when I started to brag...I started to say things like:\n\n&gt; ''Wow...it must suck to work as a waitress still...I'm making 6 figures...I can't imagine the struggle you have raising two kids...''\n\nI was pretty drunk, but I could tell that she was visibly upset and annoyed. I then just said abruptly ''Look, I'm going to cut the crap...I don't feel sorry for you, and I'm glad you are having a shit time''.\n\nI went away after that and my friends knew what I said, they said I was fucking savage for doing that and a huge asshole...but I think they don't understand that I needed to get it ouf my system? \n\nNeedless to say, **I felt GOOD that she was suffering...and I'm not sure whether that makes me an asshole if I feel it is justified to feel that way?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given story is in the wrong. The author, who is now successful, bragged to an old bully who's struggling as a single mom. The key points here are the context of past bullying, the current situation where the bully is down on her luck, and the author's actions during their encounter.\n\nFirst, the author was bullied in high school by this woman. That's a valid context. However, when they meet again, the author uses the chance to boast about their success while the other person is in a tough spot. Even though the author was drunk, the intention to brag and the subsequent comment about not feeling sorry and being glad she's suffering seem problematic. \n\nThe friends called the author a huge asshole, which is a social judgment. The author justifies it by saying they needed to get it out, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the behavior. The act of rubbing success in someone's face, especially when they're struggling, can be seen as cruel. It's one thing to have closure or confront past hurts, but it's another to actively mock someone's current hardships. \n\nEven if there was a history of bullying, the author's response crosses a line. It's important to consider empathy here. The woman is a single mother working as a waitress, which is tough. The author's comments could have been hurtful and unkind, regardless of their past. While the author might feel justified, the impact of their words matters. The question is whether taking pleasure in someone else's suffering is acceptable, which generally society would say no. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were inconsiderate and unkind. They took advantage of a vulnerable moment for the other person and used it to vent their own feelings, which isn't appropriate. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
