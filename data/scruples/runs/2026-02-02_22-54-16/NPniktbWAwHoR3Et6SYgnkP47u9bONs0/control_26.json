We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their girlfriend living together. The main issue is that the author wants to play games with friends, and the girlfriend expects plans to be made so she has something to do while he's gaming. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans each time and can just relax.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel left out or that her time is being neglected when he plays games without her. She might want to have her own time or activities, hence the request to plan ahead. On the other hand, the author is trying to balance his gaming with their relationship, suggesting that she can use her phone or relax. He also mentions she's the type who wants constant attention, which might mean he's already giving her time but also needs his own space.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to plan every time he plays? Well, it's a matter of communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels her needs aren't being met. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, which could be dismissive of her feelings. However, he's also asserting his need for personal time, which is valid. \n\nBut in relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. The girlfriend's request isn't unreasonable if she feels lonely or neglected. The author might not be wrong entirely, but maybe he could have approached the situation with more empathy. He could have discussed it to find a middle ground instead of dismissing her feelings. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. By not making plans each time, he might be ignoring her emotional needs. However, he's also not obligated to plan every activity around her. The answer might hinge on how they communicate and find a compromise. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, it's possible he isn't, but there's room for improvement. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because he's asserting his need for personal time, but there's a nuance where communication could be better. However, based on the given scenario, the immediate answer would lean towards B because he's not wrong for wanting his own space as long as both parties are respected.\n"
