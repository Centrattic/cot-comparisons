We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the guy and his girlfriend live together. He wants to play games with his friends, but she's upset because she feels like she has to make plans every time he wants to game, otherwise she's left with nothing to do. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, just relax or use his laptop. She goes to her sister's house for a few hours when he plays.\n\nHmm, so from the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel neglected when he's gaming and she's left alone. She might want quality time together instead of him just playing games. The author is saying that he's offering her to watch or talk while he plays, but she doesn't want that. So maybe the problem is communication. The author says he told her he's going to play and offered other options, but she still feels like she's being left out. \n\nBut the author also mentions that the girlfriend wants constant attention. So maybe there's a balance issue here. The author wants his gaming time, which is his personal time, but the girlfriend feels like that time is taking away from the time they could spend together. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a balance between individual needs and couple time. The author is trying to assert his need for personal time, which is reasonable. But if the girlfriend is feeling lonely or neglected when he's gaming, then maybe the author should have considered that. However, the author isn't forcing her to do anything; he's just playing games and allowing her to do her own thing. \n\nThe girlfriend might be feeling like her needs aren't being met, but the author is also meeting his needs. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because he's communicating his intentions and giving his girlfriend options. However, there's a lack of compromise. The author could be more considerate in finding middle ground, like setting specific times for gaming versus couple time. \n\nBut according to the story, the author isn't forcing her to make plans every time. He tells her she can just relax. So maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. The author is standing his ground, which is his right. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that he's not being considerate enough. But given the information, the author is trying to communicate and offer alternatives, so he's not entirely at fault. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations. So probably B.\n"
