We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author and his girlfriend living together. The main issue is that the author wants to play games with his friends, and his girlfriend is upset because she feels she needs to make plans or do something every time he's gaming. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that when they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates and couple activities. Now that they live together, he's trying to balance his own time with her expectations. The problem started when he played Apex Legends with his friend, and his girlfriend felt neglected because she didn't have anything else to do. She wanted him to plan ahead so she could go out or do something else, but he thought it was just a casual game session.\n\nThe author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays and that she can just relax or use his laptop. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to want more attention and plans around his gaming time. The author is defending his right to have some personal time with friends, which is understandable. But the girlfriend's feelings of being left out might be valid too.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author is trying to maintain his hobbies and social life, which is important for a healthy relationship. However, the girlfriend's need for attention and interaction is also valid. The key point is communication. The author tried to tell her he's okay with her not going out and just relaxing, but she seems to feel that her needs aren't being met. Repeated arguments suggest that there's a lack of understanding or compromise. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's not entirely wrong to want his own time, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. The girlfriend might feel that her needs are being ignored. The author's response of telling her not to make plans if she can't follow through might have been dismissive. Healthy relationships require both partners to find a middle ground. The author could be in the wrong if he's not making an effort to include her or if his gaming is consistently making her feel neglected. However, if he's being reasonable and she's overreacting, then maybe not.\n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction\u2014leaving to her sister's house for hours\u2014might indicate that she's not just seeking attention but possibly feeling isolated. The author's initial dismissal of her feelings (\"I thought she was kidding\") could have contributed to the tension. So there's a balance here. The author might need to adjust how he communicates his needs while being more considerate of hers. But he's not entirely in the wrong because everyone needs some personal time. It's about finding a compromise. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his right to personal time, but there's room for improvement in communication and empathy. However, if the gaming is affecting their relationship's harmony too much, maybe A. But based on the description, the author's points seem valid. So probably B.\n"
