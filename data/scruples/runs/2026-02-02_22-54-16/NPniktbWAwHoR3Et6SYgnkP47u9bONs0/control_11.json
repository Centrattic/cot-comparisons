We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation carefully. The author and his girlfriend live together and have been together for three years. He wants to play games with his friends occasionally, but she insists that if he's going to game, she should have plans to do something else. He argues that she doesn't have to go out every time and can just relax.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to maintain his hobby and social time with friends, which is important for his well-being. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel neglected or like she's not getting enough attention when he's gaming. The key issue here is communication and mutual respect.\n\nThe author initially didn't plan to game but then told his girlfriend he was going to play. She felt it was unfair because she had nothing to do. He tried to reassure her that she could watch him or talk while he plays, but she wanted to make plans. The problem escalated when she went to her sister's house each time, leading to arguments. He then told her she didn't have to make plans and could just relax on her phone.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Well, both sides have points. The author has the right to his own time, especially since they just moved in together. However, the girlfriend's feelings of needing attention are valid too. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her feelings. But at the same time, he's reasonable in saying she doesn't have to make plans every time.\n\nWait, the girlfriend might be expecting more from their time together. Maybe she's transitioning from separate lives to living together, and the sudden increase in time together is causing her to feel overwhelmed. She might need some space or activities of her own but is using the gaming as a trigger for her need for attention.\n\nOn the flip side, the author is trying to balance his personal time with the relationship. He's not wrong for wanting to maintain his hobbies, but perhaps he should have discussed this with her more. The problem might stem from differing expectations about how to spend time together. The author's response of letting her know he's gaming without preplanning might be the root cause of the conflict. However, his assertion that she doesn't need to leave every time is reasonable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about balance. If both parties are communicating and trying to find a middle ground, that's ideal. The author tried to joke about her watching him play, but she took it seriously. He later told her she could relax on her phone. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house multiple times could be seen as overreacting, but her need for attention is valid. The author might not be in the wrong because he's asserting his right to personal time, but there's a need for better communication. However, since the girlfriend is the one who initiated the conflict by going out each time and blaming him, maybe the author isn't at fault. But if he's dismissing her feelings, that could be an issue. Wait, the author says he told her they could have time together after he's done gaming. That's considerate. So maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
