We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation with their girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the setup: They've been together three years, living together for four months. The author used to game separately when they lived apart, but now they're together. The girlfriend is upset when he plays games without making plans to do something else. She wants him to inform her so she can make her own plans, but he thinks she doesn't need to go out every time.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The girlfriend is feeling neglected when he plays games, especially since they're living together now. She's asking for communication and plans so she can have things to do. The author is trying to balance his own need for downtime with her need for attention.\n\nBut wait, the author said he told her he's going to play games, and he offered her alternatives like watching or using his laptop. However, she still felt left out and went to her sister's house. The author then told her she doesn't need to make plans every time. \n\nIs the problem that the author isn't considering her feelings enough? Maybe he's not acknowledging that even if she has options, she might still feel like she's being ignored. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be expecting more effort from him to include her in his gaming time instead of just letting her have her own devices. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might be seen as a way to avoid being in the situation, which could indicate she's not handling it well. But the author's response of telling her not to make plans every time might minimize her feelings. \n\nI think the issue is more about the author not fully understanding her need for attention and not finding a middle ground. While he has the right to his gaming time, he should also consider her feelings. The answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication and compromise. But according to the question, the options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nGiven the context, the girlfriend is expressing her feelings, and the author is not respecting her need for plans. However, the author is also trying to maintain his own hobbies. The key is whether he's in the wrong for not accommodating her requests. The girlfriend's request isn't for him to stop gaming but to plan so she can have activities. If he's not making plans, maybe he's not considering her needs. But he's also not forcing her to do anything. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is not entirely in the wrong. The girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic, expecting him to preplan every gaming session. However, there's definitely a need for better communication. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he is trying to balance both their needs and isn't being abusive, the answer is B.\n"
