We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend and boyfriend living together. The main issue is that the guy wants to play games with his friends, and the girlfriend feels neglected because she has to stay home and do nothing, so she goes out to have something to do. The author (the guy) is saying he doesn't think she needs to make plans every time he wants to game. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The girlfriend has been in a relationship for 3 years and they live together now, so they're used to being around each other a lot. When they first started, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates, but now that they live together, he's trying to reclaim some of his gaming time with friends. The problem arises when the girlfriend feels that if he's gaming, she should have something to do too. She's reacting to him playing games by going out, which he finds unnecessary because he's not leaving the house. \n\nThe author is arguing that she doesn't have to make plans just because he's gaming. He points out that she can just chill on her phone or use the laptop. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that her time is being undervalued or that she's not getting enough attention. The guy is trying to balance his own interests with their relationship. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fact that this has become an argument multiple times suggests that there's a need for a compromise. The guy's response of telling her she doesn't need to go out might be dismissive of her need for personal time or activities. However, she might be using going out as a way to handle the situation, which could indicate she feels left out or that her needs aren't being met. \n\nThe author's perspective is that he wants to play games with friends, which is a normal hobby, but the girlfriend might be feeling neglected. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not accommodating her need for plans. \n\nI think it's a balance. The author isn't entirely wrong because he has a right to his hobby and interests. However, the girlfriend's feelings of needing something to do or space might be valid. The author might need to consider alternative ways for her to spend her time without having to go out, like suggesting other activities they can do together or separately. The key here is mutual respect and communication. \n\nIf the author is being dismissive, that's an issue, but if he's trying to explain that she doesn't have to go out, maybe he's not wrong. But the girlfriend's reaction might stem from a deeper need. The answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his right to have personal time, but it's more about the relationship dynamics and how they handle it, not necessarily who's in the wrong. However, there's room for both to find a middle ground.\n"
