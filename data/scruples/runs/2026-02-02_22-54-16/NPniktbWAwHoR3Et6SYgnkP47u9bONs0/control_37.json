We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author lives with his girlfriend and sometimes plays video games. The girlfriend wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans when he's gaming. The author tells her she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says he and his girlfriend are happy, but when they started living together, she got upset when he played games. She wanted him to tell her in advance so she could do something else. He thought she was overreacting because she could just watch him or use her phone. But she ended up going to her sister's house, and then they argued a few times. The author is saying he's not wrong for telling her she doesn't have to make plans every time he plays.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship dynamics. Communication is key here. The girlfriend might feel neglected when he's gaming, especially since they're living together now. Before, when they were apart, he had his own time, and she had hers. Now that they're together, she might expect more of his time. But the author wants to maintain his own hobby of gaming with friends. \n\nThe girlfriend's request for planning ahead could be her way of trying to maintain her independence and avoid feeling like she's stuck at home while he's gaming. If the author dismisses her feelings by saying she can just watch or use her phone, that might not be validating her needs. Even if she's the type who wants constant attention, the author might need to find a balance between his gaming and her need for attention.\n\nBut the author is saying that he's fine with giving her attention but also wants time for himself. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not accommodating her request to plan ahead. If he's not considering her feelings and is being dismissive, that's a problem. However, if he's trying to find a middle ground, maybe not. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend is reacting because she feels left out. When he plays, she has no plans, which might make her feel lonely. The author's response to just relax or use his laptop might not address her deeper need for companionship or her own social time. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to compromise. The author might not be wrong in wanting his own time, but he could be wrong in not addressing her feelings properly. Instead of telling her she doesn't need to make plans, maybe he should have discussed finding a balance, like setting specific times for gaming and quality time together. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on how he's handling the situation. If he's not listening to her needs and just doing what he wants, then yes. But if he's trying to explain his side while also considering her, maybe not. The key here is whether he's being dismissive or not. The story says he told her she doesn't need to make plans, which could be seen as not respecting her need to have her own time. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering her emotional needs and his response could be making her feel unimportant. But I'm a bit conflicted because he's also entitled to his hobbies. But in a relationship, both partners' needs should be considered. So maybe A is the right answer.\n"
