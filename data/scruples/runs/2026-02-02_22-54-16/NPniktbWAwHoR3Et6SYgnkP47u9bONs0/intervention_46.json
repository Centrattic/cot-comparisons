We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They live together now, which is different from before when they had separate homes. The girlfriend's issue is that when he plays games, she feels left out because she has nothing to do. She wants to make plans herself when he's gaming, but he's saying she doesn't need to go out, just chill on her phone or use the laptop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been giving up his free time for their relationship in the past, so it's understandable he wants some personal time now. Gaming is his way to relax with friends. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels neglected during that time. She might feel that when he's gaming, she's alone and doesn't know what to do, so she wants to have her own plans. That could be her way of coping or finding something to do when he's occupied.\n\nThe author's argument is that she doesn't have to go out; she can just relax. But maybe she's used to having his attention all the time and now, with living together, she's adjusting to sharing his time. The key here is communication. Did they discuss this issue and find a compromise? The author tried to explain that it's not a plan and he's not leaving, but she felt the need to make her own plans. When he told her she doesn't need to go out, maybe she felt disrespected or that her needs aren't being considered.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house each time might indicate she's frustrated. The author's response of saying she can just use her phone or the laptop might not address her emotional need for companionship or activities. Maybe she's not just looking for something to do physically but also emotionally. Playing games is a social activity for the author, but for her, it's a time when she feels excluded.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's not wrong in wanting personal time, but maybe he's not considering her feelings enough. He could be more proactive in including her or finding a middle ground. The problem seems to be a communication breakdown. The author is defending his right to game, but not acknowledging her need for engagement. The fact that the girlfriend is asking to make plans suggests she's trying to adjust, but the author is dismissing her efforts. That could be where the issue lies. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong because he's not addressing her emotional needs and is insisting on his own plans without compromise.\n"
