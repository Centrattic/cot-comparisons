We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting to play video games and their girlfriend wanting them to plan ahead so she can have something to do. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The couple has been together three years and cohabiting for four months. The author used to game alone before moving in together, but now that they live together, the girlfriend feels left out when he plays. She wants him to plan his gaming so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time, just relax or use the laptop.\n\nThe girlfriend's main issue is that when he plays games, she has nothing to do. The author thought it was okay to just mention he's playing, not planning ahead. The girlfriend is upset because she feels ignored and has to make plans on the spot, which she can't always do. The author says he's in his house, so she can just stay and do something else, like watch or use the laptop. But she feels she needs her own time, hence going to her sister's.\n\nNow, considering healthy relationships, communication is key. The author is asserting his need for personal time with friends, which is valid. However, the girlfriend's need for attention and planning ahead is also valid. The problem arises when the author dismisses her feelings as being \"in the house\" and suggests she can just relax. This might not address her emotional needs.\n\nThe author's argument is that she doesn't have to leave, but perhaps he's not acknowledging that her presence in the same space while he's engaged in something else can be isolating. The girlfriend might feel neglected if her only activity is watching him play, which she might not enjoy. So, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting her need for planned time when he's occupied. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong about wanting personal time. However, the issue is how he's handling it. He should have discussed boundaries earlier and found a middle ground. By not planning ahead, he's making it harder for her to manage her own time, which is a fair request. The answer might lean towards the author being partly in the wrong for not considering her feelings and not setting clear expectations when moving in together.\n\nIn AITA posts, it's often about balancing both sides. The author is not entirely wrong, but if the girlfriend's needs are being consistently ignored, that could tip the balance. The key is mutual respect for personal time and social time. The author should be willing to plan ahead to accommodate her needs without feeling he's losing his own time. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes) because he's dismissing her valid need for planned activities when he's busy.\n"
