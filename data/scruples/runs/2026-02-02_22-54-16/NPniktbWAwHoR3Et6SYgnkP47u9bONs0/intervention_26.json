We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, have been dating three years. The girlfriend is upset because when he plays games, she feels ignored and has nothing to do. She wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. The author, however, feels she should just relax and not feel obligated to go out. He's not against spending time together but wants to game with friends sometimes. \n\nSo, the key points here. The girlfriend's issue is about feeling neglected during his gaming sessions. She might feel like her time is being taken up without her having something to do. The author is trying to balance his personal time with her need for attention. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to maintain his hobbies and social activities with friends, which is understandable. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her time isn't being considered or that she's not included. However, the author is not forcing her to do anything; he's allowing her to relax or use her phone. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, communication is key. The author tried to explain that his gaming isn't a plan requiring her to make her own, and he offered alternatives like her watching or talking. The girlfriend, however, felt that she needed to have plans to avoid being left alone. \n\nThe author's response to her making plans every time might be valid because he's asserting his right to personal time. But does that mean he's in the wrong? If he's respectful of her feelings while maintaining his own needs, then maybe not. However, the girlfriend's need for attention and activities might also be valid. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't forcing her to do anything; he's explaining that she doesn't have to make plans just because he's gaming. His approach is reasonable if he's being considerate and not ignoring her. However, the fact that she feels the need to go out might indicate she's not getting enough quality time with him otherwise. \n\nBut the author mentions that he's fine with her constant attention but also wants his own time. The problem arises when she's upset because he's gaming and she's left without things to do. The author's solution is that she can relax or use her phone, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stating that she doesn't have to make plans every time he wants to game. He's balancing his own needs with hers, and communication seems to have been tried on his part. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her own expectations not being met, but the author's stance is valid in wanting to maintain his hobbies and social life. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
