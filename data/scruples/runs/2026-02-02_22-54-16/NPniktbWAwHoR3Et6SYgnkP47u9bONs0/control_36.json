We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is about the girlfriend wanting to make plans when the author plays games, while the author thinks she doesn't need to go out just because he's gaming.\n\nFirst, the context: the couple has been together three years, lives together now. The author used to game separately but now, living together, the girlfriend is upset when he plays without her. She wants to make her own plans during his gaming time, but he's telling her she doesn't need to. They argue about this multiple times.\n\nSo, the girlfriend is saying it's unfair for him to play games when she's left with nothing to do. The author suggests she can watch him play, talk while he plays, or just chill on her phone. But she goes to her sister's house, leading to tension. The author feels she wants constant attention but he also wants time to game with friends. \n\nKey points to consider: Communication is crucial in relationships. The author might not be wrong in wanting his personal time, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. She might feel neglected or not included. The problem arises when the author dismisses her plans by saying she doesn't need to go out, which could be seen as not respecting her needs. Even if she's being overly demanding, the author should address the issue together rather than just dismissing her. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction (going to her sister's) might indicate she feels ignored. The author's approach of giving her the laptop/phone to use might not be sufficient if she's seeking more meaningful engagement. The fact that she's been the type to want constant attention suggests that the author's gaming time might conflict with her expectations. However, the author is also within his rights to want some personal space.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't entirely wrong, but he could be more considerate. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be excessive. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are dismissive. By not making an effort to find a middle ground, like setting specific gaming times or including her in the activity, he might be contributing to the problem. On the other hand, he's trying to balance his own needs with the relationship.\n\nThe AITA subreddit often considers both perspectives. Here, the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his need for personal time, but there's room for better communication. The girlfriend's demands might be unreasonable if she's expecting him to always plan around her, but she's also expressing her needs. Since the author is defending his right to game without her having to make plans, the answer isn't clear cut. However, given the structure of the question and the typical AITA responses, the author might be justified. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
