We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The scenario is that they live together and he wants to game, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels neglected when he plays. He says she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions they've been together for 3 years and he gave up a lot of his free time initially for dates. Now that they live together, he's trying to get back into gaming, which his girlfriend is upset about. She wants to know in advance so she can make her own plans. He argues that she doesn't have to go out, just relax.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The girlfriend is expressing her feelings of being left out or not getting enough attention. The author's response is to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, which she might see as dismissive. \n\nHe says she wants constant attention, but he also wants to game. That's a common conflict in relationships\u2014balancing individual interests with the relationship. The question is whether it's fair for him to not require her to plan around his gaming or if she's being reasonable in wanting some time for herself when he's occupied.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might indicate she feels ignored. The author's approach of just saying she can relax on her phone might not be sufficient if she needs more personal time. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel valued. If he's gaming, maybe he should consider her feelings and find a middle ground, like setting specific times for gaming where they can have some activities together, or making sure she knows he's available at other times. But he's also entitled to his hobbies. \n\nThe key issue here is whether his actions are causing her distress without considering her needs. Since he acknowledged she wants constant attention, maybe he's not wrong, but perhaps he's not fully addressing her emotional needs. However, telling her she doesn't need to plan around his gaming might be a valid stance if she's being unreasonable. \n\nI think it's a bit of a grey area, but since the girlfriend is feeling neglected and the author is prioritizing his gaming without considering her feelings, he might be in the wrong. But the answer depends on whether mutual understanding and compromise have been achieved. Since the author is dismissing her need to have her own time by saying she doesn't need to go out, maybe that's the issue. He should communicate better and find a solution that works for both.\n"
