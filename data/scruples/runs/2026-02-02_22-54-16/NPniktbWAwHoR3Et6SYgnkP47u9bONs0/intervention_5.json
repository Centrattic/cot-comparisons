We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the AITA post) is in the wrong. They live with their girlfriend of three years, and the issue is about gaming time and her expectations.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author used to play games when they were at their own houses, but now that they live together, the girlfriend expects him to let her know in advance so she can make plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game, suggesting she can just relax or use her phone/laptop. The girlfriend feels neglected and misses him, leading to arguments.\n\nSo, what's the crux here? The girlfriend wants dedicated personal time when he's gaming, while the author wants the freedom to game without her feeling like she has to plan around it. Communication seems to be a big factor here. The author did try to explain that they can still spend time together after gaming, but she's not satisfied. \n\nThe author's perspective is that he's balancing his need for personal gaming time with their relationship. He's not avoiding her; he's just engaging in a hobby. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels like her needs for attention and planning her own activities are being overlooked. \n\nIs it fair for her to expect him to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans? Maybe, but it could also be a case of her needing to find other ways to occupy herself when he's busy. The author's response that she can relax or use her phone is reasonable. However, the fact that she's going to her sister's house might indicate she's seeking independence or support elsewhere, which could be a deeper issue.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, both have valid points. The author isn't wrong to want to game, especially since they've been together for a long time. But maybe he could be more considerate in his communication. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be over-the-top if she's using gaming as a reason to make plans she doesn't really need. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's advocating for his own needs and explaining that gaming isn't a planned event that requires her to make external arrangements. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations or find other ways to manage her time when he's occupied. So, answer B.\n"
