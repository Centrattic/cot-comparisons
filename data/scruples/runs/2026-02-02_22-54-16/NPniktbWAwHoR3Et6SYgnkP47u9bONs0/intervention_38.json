We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The situation is about the author wanting to game sometimes, and the girlfriend expecting them to make plans every time he wants to play. The author argues that the girlfriend doesn't need to make plans just because he's gaming, suggesting she can relax or do something else.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together three years and living together for four months. The author used to game alone when they were apart, and now that they live together, the girlfriend is upset when he plays games without making plans for her. She feels left out and wants him to plan so she can have something to do. The author tried to explain that she can watch or use his laptop/phone, but she didn't like that. He gave her advance notice sometimes, but if she didn't make plans, she blamed him. The author feels she wants constant attention but he also wants to game with friends.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling neglected or not having her own time or space when the author is gaming. She might be using the gaming as a way to either spend more time with him or have her own activities, but when he's busy, she feels like she's stuck. The author, on the other hand, is trying to balance his own need for downtime with her need for attention. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not making plans every time he wants to game. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author did try to communicate, but the girlfriend's expectations weren't met. The problem might be that the girlfriend is expecting the author to structure his gaming time in a way that accommodates her always, which might not be feasible. The author's response of saying she doesn't have to go out and just chill on her phone or use the laptop is a reasonable compromise. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't fully consider the girlfriend's feelings of loneliness when he's gaming. Even if she can watch or do her own thing, she might feel like their time is being replaced. The author might need to find a middle ground where both can have their needs met, like setting specific times for gaming where he's not available, and other times for them to be together. However, in the situation described, the author is trying to assert his right to have personal time, which is also valid. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author is wrong for not accommodating her need for plans every time. Since he's providing space for her to do her own thing and isn't excluding her from his presence (they still live together), he might not be in the wrong. The main issue is the communication and expectations between them. The author isn't doing something inherently wrong by gaming, but maybe he could be more proactive in ensuring her needs are met without forcing her to make plans every time. However, the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's actions don't seem malicious. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
