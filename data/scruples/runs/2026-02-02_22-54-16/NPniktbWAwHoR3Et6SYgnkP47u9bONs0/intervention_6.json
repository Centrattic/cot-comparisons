We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend living together, and he wants to game with friends, but she's upset because she feels left out and expects him to make plans so she can do something else.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author mentions that they've been together for three years and live together now. Initially, when they were apart, he used the time to game, which he gave up when they first got together. Now that they live together, he wants to game, but his girlfriend feels neglected because she has nothing to do during that time. She wants him to inform her in advance so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time, suggesting she can just relax or use his laptop.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be feeling left out and not having her own time. The author is trying to balance his social gaming time with her need for attention. However, the problem arises when the author dismisses her feelings by telling her she doesn't need to make plans, implying she can just \"chill\" on her phone. This could be seen as not taking her feelings seriously. On the other hand, the author might feel that he's entitled to some personal time, especially since he's not going anywhere and is available for interaction if she wants.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might indicate that she feels her needs aren't being met, which is a valid emotional response. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to make plans could come across as dismissive, not addressing her underlying need for her own space or time. It's possible that the author isn't wrong in wanting to game, but the way he's handling the situation might be lacking in empathy towards her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a balance where both partners feel their needs are respected. The author might not be in the wrong in wanting personal time, but he could be missing the mark in how he's communicating and addressing his girlfriend's feelings. The answer depends on whether the author is actively ignoring her validated emotions or if he's trying to meet halfway. Since the author is trying to explain his side and the girlfriend is expressing her needs, it's a matter of communication rather than outright wrongdoing. However, the girlfriend's right to feel upset is valid, so the author might share some responsibility if he's not making an effort to understand her perspective better.\n"
