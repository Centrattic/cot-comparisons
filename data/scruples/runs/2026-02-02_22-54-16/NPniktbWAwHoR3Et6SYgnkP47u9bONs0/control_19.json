We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author and his girlfriend living together, and he wants to play video games sometimes. The girlfriend expects him to make plans for when he plays games so she can go out and do things, otherwise she feels neglected. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans just because he's gaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that when they first got together, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates and couple activities. Now that they live together, he wants to game with friends. The girlfriend feels that when he plays, she has nothing to do and wants to make plans to do her own things. But the author thinks she doesn't have to go out and can just relax or use his laptop.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend might feel that when he's gaming, she's left with nothing to do, which could lead to feelings of neglect. However, the author is also expressing his need for personal time. The problem seems to be that there's a mismatch in their expectations. The author didn't consider that his girlfriend might need some alone time to do her own things, and she didn't realize that he wants to have his own hobby time. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans every time he games. But maybe he should have communicated better. Instead of dismissing her feelings, he could have found a compromise. For example, setting specific times for gaming and other times for couple activities, or figuring out a way both can be satisfied. \n\nHowever, the author did try to explain that she could relax or use his laptop. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house multiple times might indicate that she feels ignored. The author might be in the right by asserting his need for personal time, but he also needs to acknowledge her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance each other's needs. The author isn't entirely wrong because he has the right to his hobbies, but he might not have handled the communication well. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because both parties have valid points, but the main issue is communication. However, if the author consistently dismisses her feelings, that could be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend is used to needing constant attention and the author is now not meeting that expectation, he might be in the wrong for not adjusting to her needs. But he also has a right to his own activities. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his need for personal time, but there's a communication issue. However, the answer could also be A if the author is not considering her feelings enough. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's main point is that he doesn't think she needs to make plans every time he plays. The girlfriend wants plans so she can do her own things. The author's response is that she can just relax. But maybe she needs more than that. However, the author is trying to balance his own time. Since they live together, mutual adjustments are necessary. The author's approach might be valid, but the execution could be better. \n\nIn AITA posts, usually, the answer is nuanced. Here, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's communicating his needs, but he could have been more considerate. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because he's not doing anything inherently wrong, but the situation requires mutual compromise. The girlfriend's expectations might be unreasonable, but the author's approach could be adjusted. So, the answer is B.\n"
