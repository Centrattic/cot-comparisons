We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They live together and have been together for three years. The situation started when he mentioned playing Apex Legends with a friend, and his girlfriend felt she had nothing to do during that time. She wanted him to make plans so she could be busy too, but he told her she didn't need to go out and could just relax. She went to her sister's house, and the argument repeated a few times.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about expectations in a relationship regarding personal time and activities. The author thinks it's reasonable to game without her making plans, while she feels neglected or wants more structured time together or for herself. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her time is being overlooked. She might value planned activities or feel that when he's gaming, she's left without things to do. The author, on the other hand, is asserting his right to personal time with friends, which is common in relationships.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author tried to explain that it's not a plan and offered alternatives like talking while gaming. However, the girlfriend might feel that her needs aren't being met if she's left alone during those times. The problem arises when one partner's personal time causes the other to feel ignored. \n\nBut from a fairness standpoint, it's normal to have personal hobbies and friends. The author isn't forcing her to do anything; he's just engaging in his own activity. The girlfriend might need to find her own way to spend time, whether that's using her phone, working on something, or socializing. The author's response that she doesn't need to leave every time seems reasonable because he's not making her do anything. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings about missing him and wanting structured plans might indicate a deeper need for quality time together or for her own activities. The author could have been more proactive in understanding her needs, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to balance personal time and couple time. The author isn't violating any major boundaries by playing games, especially since he's not isolating himself completely. He even offered to talk while gaming. The girlfriend's frustration is valid, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting his own space. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. It's a communication issue that needs mutual understanding and compromise, but the author's actions aren't inherently wrong.\n"
