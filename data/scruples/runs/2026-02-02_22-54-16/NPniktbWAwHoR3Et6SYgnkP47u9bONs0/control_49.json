We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. He wants to play video games sometimes, especially with friends, and she's getting upset because she feels like she has to make plans whenever he wants to game. The author says that he told her she doesn't need to make plans every time he plays, but she's still upset and leaves to go to her sister's house when he plays.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to balance his personal time for gaming with his relationship. He mentions that before they lived together, he used to game when they were apart, and now that they live together, he still wants that time. He's trying to tell her she doesn't have to go out every time, just relax or use her phone. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels left out or neglected when he's gaming. She wants to spend time with him and might feel that he's ignoring her. The fact that she went to her sister's house shows she's upset and maybe feeling like she doesn't have anything to do when he's occupied with games.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is trying to communicate that gaming is his downtime and that she doesn't have to leave the house every time. However, the girlfriend might feel that her needs for attention and companionship aren't being met. The argument is recurring, so there's a lack of resolution. The author's suggestion that she can watch him play or use her phone might not be sufficient if she expects more active engagement or time together when he's available. It's possible that the author is not considering her feelings enough, even if he wants his own space. Relationships require compromise, and if one person's needs are consistently unmet, it could lead to issues. However, the author is also asserting his need for personal time, which is valid. The problem might lie in how they're communicating these needs. If he's dismissive of her feelings or not validating her, then he might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if she's being overly demanding without considering his need for alone time, that's also a problem. But based on the description, the author is trying to set boundaries, which is okay, but perhaps not acknowledging her emotional response. So the answer might be B (No), because he's not entirely wrong, but maybe there's room for both to adjust. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, given that he's trying to balance time and she's not respecting his need for gaming time, maybe it's a shared responsibility. However, according to the AITA framework, if he's being reasonable in his boundaries, then he's not in the wrong. So B.\n"
