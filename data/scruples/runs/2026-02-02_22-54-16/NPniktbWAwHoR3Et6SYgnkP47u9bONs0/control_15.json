We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They've been living together for four months and been dating three years. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend is upset because when he plays games, she feels left out. She wants him to notify her in advance so she can plan her own activities. The author thinks she's overreacting and tells her she can just use her phone or relax. \n\nThe key points here: The author used to have separate time for gaming when they weren't living together. Now, living together, their time is overlapping more. The girlfriend feels neglected when he plays games without planning it in advance. The author argues that she doesn't need to leave the house each time and that he's right there for her after.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author's initial approach was to let her know he was playing, which is good, but maybe not enough. The girlfriend's feeling of needing to have plans because she's alone while he plays suggests she values quality time or activities that she can engage in independently. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her she can just use her phone or relax. That might dismiss her feelings. She might need more than that\u2014like knowing he's going to be occupied so she can plan her own time. The problem arises because she feels her needs aren't being met. \n\nThe author isn't inherently wrong for wanting his gaming time, but he needs to consider her feelings. Relationships require balance. If he's not acknowledging her need for activities and just expects her to be okay with waiting, that could be the issue. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author being in the right because he's asserting his own needs, but the problem is more about communication and mutual understanding. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her she doesn't need to make plans, and considering she's feeling neglected, maybe the answer is A (Yes). Wait, but the author is defending his right to game, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't wrong because he's not forcing her to leave; he's allowing her to stay and relax using her phone. But the girlfriend's reaction shows that her needs aren't being met. It's a balance. The author is not in the wrong for wanting his hobby, but he could be wrong in not addressing her feelings adequately. \n\nHmm, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't doing anything harmful. However, the girlfriend's perspective is valid too. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not accommodating her need to plan. Since the author is explaining his side and the girlfriend's reaction is about her needing attention, the answer could be B, but the author's actions might not be entirely right. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether he's violating any mutual understanding. If the girlfriend feels neglected, the author might need to adjust. But according to the scenario, he's not forcing her to do anything. So maybe B is correct because he's not doing something wrong, but he could be more considerate. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author is defending his gaming time and the girlfriend is overreacting, perhaps B (No) is the answer. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check again. The author says \"she didn\u2019t need to go out every time\" and she's the one who went to her sister's house. The author's actions are not wrong, but the situation is a conflict between two valid needs. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
