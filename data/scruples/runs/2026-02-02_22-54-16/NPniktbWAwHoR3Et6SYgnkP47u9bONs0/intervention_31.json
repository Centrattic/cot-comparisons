We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend wanting to make plans every time he wants to play games. They've been living together for four months and have been together for three years. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says he's telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans when he wants to game. His girlfriend's reaction was that it's unfair because she has nothing else to do, and she wants him to plan ahead so she can do something else. He jokes about her watching him play, but she takes it seriously and leaves. Then there are repeated arguments where she blames him if she doesn't make plans.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to balance his time between gaming with friends and his relationship. He mentions that before they lived together, he used to game alone when they were apart, and now he wants to continue that. He thinks she's the one wanting constant attention but he also wants his own time. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that when living together, she expects companionship and that if he's going to be busy gaming, she should have time to do her own things. She might feel neglected if he just plays without considering her. Her reaction of going to her sister's house might be a way to cope with the frustration.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author is trying to assert his need for personal time, which is valid, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough initially. When she expressed her need for plans, he dismissed it as her wanting constant attention, which could be invalidating her feelings. However, he did try to communicate and even offered alternatives like her using her phone or the laptop. \n\nThe problem arises when he tells her she doesn't need to make plans every time. If she's feeling that she's not being included or that her needs aren't respected, then the author might be overstepping. On the other hand, expecting someone to make plans every time someone else wants to do something might be unrealistic. The balance here is about finding a middle ground where both can have their needs met.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have been more proactive in understanding her feelings instead of just stating his position. However, his desire to have personal time isn't inherently wrong. The issue might be more about how the situation is handled rather than who is objectively right. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because it's a matter of balancing personal space and partner's needs. But he could have been more empathetic. The answer is likely B (No), but with the note that both parties need to communicate better.\n"
