We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together after being in a 3-year relationship. He's trying to play games with friends, and she's upset because she feels left out. The author says she wants to make plans every time he wants to game, but he's telling her she doesn't need to. He's arguing that she can just relax or use her phone, but she seems to be unhappy with that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is asking for plans to be made when he wants to game, which he sees as unnecessary. The author mentions that before moving in together, he gave up a lot of free time for dates and couple activities. Now that they live together, he's trying to reclaim some personal time for gaming. The girlfriend feels neglected and misses the time they used to spend together alone. The author's response is that he's not going anywhere and they can talk while he plays. But she doesn't want that and leaves to go to her sister's house. This leads to arguments where he gives her advance notice, but if she doesn't make plans, she blames him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship advice perspective, communication is key. Both partners need to feel comfortable with the time they spend together and separately. The author is trying to maintain his personal time for gaming, which is a common activity. However, the girlfriend feels that when they live together, he's using gaming as a way to not spend time with her. \n\nThe author's argument is that she doesn't need to make plans if he's just gaming at home. He's not going out, so she can chill. But the girlfriend's perspective is that she wants quality time with him, not just being in the same room. She might feel that when he's gaming, he's not attentive. The author's joking about her watching him play and later suggesting she use her phone might not be taking her feelings seriously. \n\nIn many relationships, it's important to balance personal hobbies with time spent together. The author might be right in wanting to keep his gaming, but maybe he needs to consider her feelings more. The girlfriend's reaction of leaving to her sister's house could indicate she feels ignored. The author's response to her not making plans, even after giving her notice, might be dismissive. \n\nBut the author also mentions that she's the \"kinda girl who wants constant attention,\" which he's okay with. However, living together can change dynamics. Maybe she's adjusting to the new living situation and feels that shared space is now their shared time, so any alone time he takes is a problem. \n\nI think the main issue here is communication. The author is trying to assert his personal time, but not in a way that's inclusive of her needs. The girlfriend may feel that her needs for connection are being overlooked. So, does that make the author in the wrong? It might be a mutual misunderstanding, but from the description, the author isn't making accommodations. Maybe he should be more considerate of her feelings and find a middle ground. Alternatively, if she's being unreasonable and he's trying to keep his hobbies, he might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut the key is that she's feeling left out, and he's not addressing that. Saying \"just relax on your phone\" isn't a solution for her need for attention. The author should probably communicate better and perhaps set aside time for both activities. If he's not doing that, then maybe he is in the wrong. But if they had agreed to live with some separate hobbies, then maybe not. The problem is that the girlfriend is reacting strongly, and the author's approach might be causing her to feel neglected. \n\nGiven that, the answer could be B (No, he's not in the wrong) if the expectation is that living together allows for personal activities. But if the relationship requires mutual planning, then A. The author's justification is that she doesn't need plans for something he's doing at home. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she wants more interaction. The best answer is B because the author is asserting his right to personal time, but maybe he should find a compromise. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her to go out, but suggesting she doesn't need to, it's a balance. I think the answer is B, but I'm a bit conflicted. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to game. It's more about their agreement and communication.\n"
