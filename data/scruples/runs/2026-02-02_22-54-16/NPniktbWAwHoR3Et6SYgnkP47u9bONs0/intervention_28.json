We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting them to plan their gaming time so she can make her own plans, but the author is telling her she doesn't need to go out every time he plays games. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together three years and recently started living together. The author used to game alone when they lived separately, but now that they're together, the girlfriend feels like she's missing out when he plays. She wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans, but the author thinks she doesn't need to do that because he's just at home and they can have time together later. The girlfriend is upset because he didn't plan in advance, even though she didn't make plans, and the author is telling her to just relax and use her phone or laptop.\n\nSo, the core issue is communication and expectations. When two people live together, they need to balance their individual needs. The author wants to game with friends, which is a social activity for him, while the girlfriend feels neglected and wants quality time. The problem arises when the author's gaming becomes a recurring issue that the girlfriend feels the need to plan around, even if it's just staying home. The author's response is dismissive, suggesting she can just relax, which might not address her emotional needs.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend is expressing her feelings of missing out and wanting attention. The author, while acknowledging that, isn't adjusting his behavior to accommodate her. Instead, he's insisting that she doesn't need to make plans, which might not validate her feelings. In a healthy relationship, compromise is key. The author could perhaps set a specific time for gaming and communicate that in advance, allowing the girlfriend to plan her own time or spend time together. By not doing so, the author might be prioritizing his own needs without considering her feelings, leading to recurring arguments. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might be a sign of her feeling ignored or unimportant. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also within his rights to want some personal time, especially since he's shared a lot of time with her already. The question is whether his actions are causing unnecessary harm. The girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic if she expects the author to plan every gaming session in advance just for her to adjust, especially if the author isn't going out. Maybe the solution is a middle ground, like agreeing on certain times for gaming and other times for couple activities. The author's answer of telling her she doesn't need to go out every time is valid, but the communication around it could be better. Instead of dismissing her feelings, he could find a way to make her feel included even while he's gaming, like watching together or setting a time limit. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he has a right to personal time, but he could be more considerate in how he communicates and balances their needs. However, the girlfriend's approach might also be contributing to the conflict. The question is whether the author's actions are the primary issue. In this case, since the girlfriend is seeking a plan and the author is not accommodating that, leading to repeated arguments, there's a case for the author being in the wrong for not addressing her concerns adequately. Alternatively, if the girlfriend is overreacting to a reasonable personal activity, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's gaming is causing significant harm or neglect. If the girlfriend feels consistently ignored, then the author might need to adjust. But if the author is only gaming occasionally and not neglecting their relationship otherwise, maybe not. The answer hinges on the balance and communication. Since the author is in a long-term relationship, it's important to consider both partners' needs. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to plan might be dismissive of her feelings, so maybe he's partially in the wrong. But I'm not sure. The Girlfriend's reaction might be unreasonable if she's expecting him to plan every gaming session just for her to avoid being alone. The author has a right to his hobbies. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at whether the person's actions crossed a line. Here, the author isn't doing anything harmful per se\u2014gaming with friends is normal. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author's refusal to plan might be dismissive. So the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because he's not doing anything wrong, but there's room for B with the suggestion to communicate better. Alternatively, if the community sees the author not considering her feelings enough, it might be A. But based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong as he's not violating any norms, but could improve communication.\n"
