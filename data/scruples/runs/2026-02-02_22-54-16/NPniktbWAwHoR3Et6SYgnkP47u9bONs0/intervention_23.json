We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a couple living together where the author wants to play games, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels left out or neglected when he plays. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The couple has been together for three years and now lives together. The author mentions that in the past, he gave up his free time for dates and couple activities. Now, with them living together, he wants to play games with friends. The girlfriend is upset because she feels she has nothing to do when he's gaming. The author tried to reason that she can watch him play or use her phone, but she insists on making plans and even went to her sister's house when he played.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's feelings matter too. She might be feeling neglected when he's engrossed in gaming. The author is defending his right to have personal time but might not be considering her emotional needs. The girlfriend's request to plan around his gaming time might not be unreasonable if she needs to have her own activities to feel engaged or not left out. However, the author's point is that she shouldn't feel obligated to make plans just because he wants to game. \n\nIs there a balance? The author did try to communicate, but it led to arguments. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might indicate she feels isolated. The author's response to tell her she can just relax and use her phone seems dismissive of her feelings. Maybe the author isn't wrong entirely, but perhaps he could have approached the situation with more empathy, acknowledging her feelings rather than dismissing them as a joke. \n\nThe girlfriend might need more attention, and the author might need to find a middle ground, like setting specific gaming times when he's more available for her, or including her in some gaming activities if possible. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asserting his right to personal time and she's overreacting to some extent, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if his gaming is affecting their relationship dynamics negatively, maybe he should adjust. But based on the description, the main conflict is her need for constant attention versus his need for personal time. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because making time for oneself is important in a relationship, but there's room for better communication and compromise.\n"
