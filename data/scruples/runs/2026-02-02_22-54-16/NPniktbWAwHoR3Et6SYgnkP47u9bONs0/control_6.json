We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple living together, where the guy wants to play video games with friends, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels neglected and wants to have plans when he's gaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions they've been together for three years and live together now. He used to give up his free time for dates and couple activities but now wants to play games. The girlfriend seems to feel that when he's gaming, she's left with nothing to do and wants him to plan so she can go out. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time and can just relax or use her phone/laptop.\n\nFrom the author's side, he's trying to maintain his own hobbies and social time with friends, which is important for personal balance in a relationship. It's reasonable for him to want some personal time. However, he did mention that he gave her advance notice, which shows he tried to communicate. The problem arises when the girlfriend expects him to coordinate their schedules so she can go out. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, which might come off as dismissive, but he's also pointing out that she can choose to relax instead of feeling obligated to go out.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she misses him and wants to spend time with him, especially since they live together. She might be feeling that his gaming time takes away from their time together. However, the author is trying to set boundaries. Communication is key here. The fact that they're having recurring arguments suggests that there's a need for better communication and compromise. The author's statement about not being in the wrong might depend on how they handle the situation. If he's being respectful and offers her alternatives (like talking while he plays), maybe he's not entirely at fault. But if he's ignoring her feelings and not making an effort to balance both their needs, then maybe he is.\n\nHowever, the author does mention that he tried to explain that she can relax and use her phone, which might indicate he's making an effort. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house for hours each time seems a bit extreme, possibly indicating that she's using this as a way to get attention or validate her feelings. The core issue is about finding a middle ground where both can have their needs met. The author's approach might be a bit dismissive, but it's also about asserting his own needs. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a common relationship issue where both parties might have some responsibilities. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's trying to maintain his hobbies and is communicating his willingness to spend time with her after gaming, and the girlfriend's response seems to be about her own expectations not being met, the fault isn't entirely on the author. He's not in the wrong for wanting personal time and setting boundaries, especially if he's making an effort to be considerate. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
