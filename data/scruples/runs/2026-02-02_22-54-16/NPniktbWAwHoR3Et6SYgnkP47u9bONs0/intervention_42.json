We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, been in a 3-year relationship. The guy used to game alone before they moved in, and now that they live together, he wants to game but his girlfriend expects him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. She went to her sister's, and the guy felt like she was blaming him when she didn't follow through.\n\nThe guy argues that he's not making a plan that requires her to be busy, just gaming. He's willing to spend time with her after, but she wants him to plan so she can have her own time. He told her she doesn't need to go out, just relax. \n\nSo, the key points here are about expectations. The girlfriend wants plans made in advance so she can have her own time, while the guy feels it's not a plan that requires her to do something. The girl might feel neglected if he's gaming without considering her. The guy is trying to balance his personal time with her need for attention.\n\nI think the guy isn't entirely in the wrong because gaming is his personal time, but maybe he should have considered her feelings more. However, he's not forcing her to leave; he's just saying she doesn't have to. The problem arises from their communication and differing needs. The girlfriend might need more attention, and the guy might not realize how her absence affects her. But the guy is also trying to maintain his hobbies. \n\nSince the user thinks the author isn't wrong, and the situation is more about differing expectations rather than a clear right or wrong, the answer might be B. He's not in the wrong, but they need better communication.\n"
