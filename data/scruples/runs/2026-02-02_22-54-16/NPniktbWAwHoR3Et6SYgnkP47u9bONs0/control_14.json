We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting to play games with friends while living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she feels neglected when he plays games, and she wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, just relax.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author and his girlfriend live together, so they spend a lot of time together. Before moving in, the author used his alone time to game. Now, he's trying to continue that, but his girlfriend is feeling left out. She wants to have her own activities when he's gaming, which he sees as unnecessary planning. He thinks she should just relax on her phone or use the laptop. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that when he's gaming, she's stuck with nothing to do, and she wants to have her own time, which requires planning. The author, on the other hand, feels like he should be able to game without her overreacting. He even jokes that she can watch him play, but she takes it seriously and leaves for her sister's house. The conflict escalates because he gives her advance notice, but if she doesn't make plans, she blames him. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, when two people live together, they need to balance their individual and shared time. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering his girlfriend's feelings. She might feel that her needs for attention and social interaction are being ignored. But the author is also trying to maintain his hobby and social connections, which is important for his well-being. \n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author's initial response to her feelings (\"she doesn't need to go out every time\") might dismiss her valid feelings. Telling her to \"chill on her phone\" could be seen as a way to make her be alone while he's occupied. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel their needs are heard. The author might have a point in wanting to game, but he should also acknowledge her need for her own activities and find a middle ground. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is partially in the wrong because he's not fully addressing his girlfriend's emotional needs and isn't compromising. He's prioritizing his gaming without considering how it affects her. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
