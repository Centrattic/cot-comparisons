We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author lives with his girlfriend, and they've been together three years. The issue is that the author wants to play games with friends using their Xbox, which was previously just for streaming services. The girlfriend is upset because when he plays games, she feels she has to make plans to do something else, which she's not happy about.\n\nThe author mentions that he didn't expect her reaction. She feels it's unfair because she has nothing else to do while he's gaming. He tried to reassure her that she could watch or talk, but she still left to go to her sister's. The argument repeats when he gives her advanced notice but she fails to make her own plans, then blames him. The author tells her she doesn't need to go out, just relax or use his laptop.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Let me think. The key points are about communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend wants to be included or have her own time. The author wants to game. But when he games, he's using the Xbox they share, which maybe she also expects to use for her own purposes. However, he's been using it for streaming before, so maybe the new use is causing conflict.\n\nThe author's response is that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. But maybe the girlfriend's issue is that she feels neglected when he's gaming. The author is giving her space to do her own thing, but she might feel that the shared console is a resource she can't use when he's on it. The problem is that the console is for both, so if he's using it for gaming, she can't use it for streaming unless he's not. So maybe the girlfriend is upset because she can't use the console when he's gaming, and he's not considering her need to use it for entertainment. But the author is using it for his own activity. \n\nAnother angle: the author says he wants to play games with friends, which is a valid desire. The girlfriend wants to spend time with him, and when he's gaming, she feels left out. But he's in a relationship where he's allowing her to watch or talk, but she wants more than that. Maybe she expects him to prioritize time with her, but he's balancing his own needs. \n\nThe author is trying to set boundaries, telling her she doesn't have to go out every time. However, if the girlfriend feels that the gaming time is taking away from their time together, maybe there's a communication issue. The author might be in the right because he's expressing his need to have personal time, but maybe he should consider her feelings more. But the girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's might be excessive. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for not accommodating her need to make plans every time he wants to game. If they live together, the shared console is a shared resource. If he's using it for gaming, she can't use it for streaming. But before, they only used it for streaming, so the change to gaming might be the issue. Maybe the author should have discussed with her when they moved in about how the console would be used. \n\nAlternatively, the author is in the right because he's using the console for its intended purpose (gaming) and she's using it for streaming. It's a balance of personal time. But the girlfriend's feeling of neglect might be valid. However, the author is trying to set boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's trying to have his own time and isn't forcing her to do anything. The girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic. But maybe there's room for better communication. However, the core of the issue is the author's right to use the console when he wants, and the girlfriend's need to feel included. Since the author is allowing her to be present or have her own devices, it's not his fault she's upset. So B makes sense.\n"
