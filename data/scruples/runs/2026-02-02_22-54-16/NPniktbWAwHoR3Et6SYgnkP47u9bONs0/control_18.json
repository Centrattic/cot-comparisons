We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend live together. He's been playing games with his friends, and she's upset because she feels like she has nothing to do while he's gaming. She wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. He argues that she doesn't need to go out every time and can just relax. She feels neglected, he wants to play games with friends. \n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. When they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates. Now that they live together, there's a conflict between his gaming time and her need for engagement. The author is saying that she's expecting him to plan his gaming so she can have her own plans, but he's not okay with that. He's saying she's being too demanding because he's allowed to have his own time. \n\nThe girlfriend's main issue is that during his gaming, she feels left out. She's suggesting that if he plans to game, she should have time to do something else. The author is pushing back, saying she can just relax or use her phone. But she's going to her sister's house multiple times, which might indicate she's not getting her needs met. \n\nNow, considering healthy relationships, both partners should have their needs respected. The author has a right to his hobbies, but he might not consider how his actions affect her. The girlfriend's reaction is that she wants to spend time with her own friends or have something to do. The problem is that the author isn't planning ahead to accommodate her, leading to her feeling isolated. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not planning his gaming time in a way that considers her feelings. He's dismissing her by saying she can just relax or use her phone, which might not be what she needs. Healthy communication requires both parties to express their needs and find a middle ground. The author's refusal to plan ahead and his dismissive attitude might be the issue here. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend is making it a plan that she has to go out every time. Maybe she's overreacting by taking it out of the house, but she's feeling neglected. The author is also in a position where he wants his own time. The issue is mutual understanding. The author might not be in the wrong because he's expressing his need for personal time, but he could be more considerate. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's trying to communicate her needs. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is at fault. The author's response to her concern is dismissive. Instead of finding a solution, he's saying she doesn't need to make plans. That's where the problem lies. He's not considering her feelings adequately. So, the author is partially at fault for not being more proactive in addressing her needs and ensuring she isn't left out. The answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not considering her feelings and is being dismissive. Alternatively, if the answer is B (no, he's not), maybe because he has the right to his own time. \n\nHmm. The key is whether the author is wrong in dismissing her need for plans. In a relationship, both needs are valid. The author is in the wrong if he's not finding a balance. Since he's not making an effort to plan ahead or find a compromise, he's at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
