We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The scenario is that they live together, and the author wants to play games with friends, but the girlfriend gets upset if she's not making plans to do something else during that time. The author tells her she doesn't need to plan something just because he wants to game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for three years and are now living together. The author mentions that when they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his free time for the relationship. Now, with living together, they're spending more time together. The key issue is the girlfriend feeling left out when he's gaming. She wants to make plans so she's not left alone. The author, on the other hand, wants to have his gaming time and feels she doesn't need to go out every time. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from a need for attention or companionship. She went to her sister's house for a few hours, which might indicate she felt neglected. The author jokes about her watching him play, but she takes it seriously. The repeated arguments suggest this is a recurring issue. \n\nThe author argues that the girlfriend is the one wanting constant attention, which he's okay with, but he also wants to have his own time. The question is whether it's wrong for him to tell her she doesn't need to plan something every time he wants to game. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author mentions that he tried to explain he wasn't going anywhere and they could talk while he played, but she didn't want that. So, maybe the problem is that the girlfriend's needs for her own time or social interaction aren't being met. However, the author is also expressing a need for his own time. \n\nIt's a balance. The author isn't doing anything wrong by wanting to game, but perhaps not considering her feelings enough. If the girlfriend is feeling neglected, it's a two-way issue. The author's response that she doesn't need to plan something every time could be valid if she's okay with just relaxing. But since she's clearly upset and this has led to arguments, maybe the author isn't being empathetic enough. \n\nThe girlfriend's approach of making plans every time the author wants to game might be too much, especially if he's just at home. The author suggesting she can use her phone or the laptop is a reasonable offer. However, if she's feeling left out, the author might need to find a middle ground, like setting specific times for gaming and couple time. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of both. The author isn't wrong in wanting his own time, but maybe he's not fully addressing her feelings of neglect. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be excessive. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and he's expressing his own need for downtime, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there's a standard expectation here. In many relationships, both partners need personal space. The author isn't forcing her to do anything; he's just stating she doesn't need to plan something. The problem is more on her side, perhaps, if she's making it an issue every time. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
