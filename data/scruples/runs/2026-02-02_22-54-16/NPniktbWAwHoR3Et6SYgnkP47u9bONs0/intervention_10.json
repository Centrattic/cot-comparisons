We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if they're at fault for telling their girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They live together, been together three years. He used to give up his free time for dates before, but now he wants to play games. The girlfriend is upset because when he plays, she feels left out and wants to have her own plans. He told her she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, just relax or use her phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend might feel neglected if her partner is gaming and expects her to just sit around. She might want her own space or activities. On the other hand, the author is trying to maintain his hobby and social time with friends. It's a common issue in relationships where partners have different needs for alone time or socializing.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author mentions that he tried to explain it's not a plan and that they can spend time later. However, the girlfriend seems to feel that she's not getting enough attention or that her needs aren't being met. The argument arises when she feels she has to make plans every time he games, which he thinks is unnecessary.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's asserting his right to have personal time, which is reasonable. But if his gaming is causing her distress, maybe he should have discussed boundaries earlier. However, in the situation described, he's trying to compromise by suggesting she can relax or use her phone. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling undervalued, but the author isn't forcing her to do anything; he's just stating that she doesn't have to make plans. \n\nIt's possible that both could benefit from better communication. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting his personal time, but he could also consider his partner's feelings more. However, based on the information given, it seems the author is not doing anything malicious. He's not making her do anything, just clarifying that she doesn't have to. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. Like, if the gaming is affecting their relationship quality, but the question is whether he's in the wrong for the specific statement. Since he's not forcing her to plan, just explaining she can choose to relax, I think B is the right choice.\n"
