We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The author lives with their girlfriend and wants to game with friends. The girlfriend feels left out when he plays games and wants to make plans when he does, but the author thinks she doesn't need to go out every time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that when they first got together, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates, but now they live together. The girlfriend is upset when he plays games without including her, and she feels neglected. The author tried to explain that she can watch him play or just relax, but she still goes to her sister's house. The author then says she doesn't need to make plans every time.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. The girlfriend wants to spend time with him, and when he's gaming, she feels left out. The author wants to game with friends, which is a valid personal need. However, the way the author responds might be part of the issue. Saying she doesn't need to make plans every time could come off as dismissive of her feelings. Even if she's the type who wants attention, the author's not acknowledging her need to have time with him might be the problem.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house multiple times suggests she's not feeling heard. The author's solution of \"just relax and use my laptop\" might not address her emotional need for his presence. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong in wanting to game, but perhaps they need to communicate better, find a balance, or find ways to include her during gaming sessions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author isn't considering the girlfriend's feelings and is being dismissive, then maybe they are partially at fault. However, the girlfriend's expectations might be a bit high, expecting plans every time he wants to game. It's a balance between personal time and partnership. The author's stance is that gaming isn't a plan she needs to make plans for, which is reasonable, but the way it's handled could be improved. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for better communication.\n"
