We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe user (the author) is in a relationship with his girlfriend. They've been together three years and live together now. Initially, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates and couple activities. When they were apart, he used that time to game. Now that they live together, when he wants to game, he tells her and she gets upset because she feels she has nothing to do while he's playing. He tried suggesting she watch him play or use her phone, but she left to go to her sister's. They had arguments about this, and he told her she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants to game with friends, which is a personal activity. The girlfriend feels neglected and wants to be involved or have her own plans. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author mentions that he's okay with her wanting attention but also wants time to game. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that she feels her needs aren't being met. The author's approach of telling her she doesn't need to make plans might come off as dismissive of her feelings. Even though he offered alternatives (watching, using her phone), she didn't want that. \n\nThe problem arises when the author downplays her need for engagement. By saying she doesn't need to make plans, he might be invalidating her feelings of missing him and wanting to spend time together. Healthy relationships require compromise. The author could be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging her emotional needs. However, it's also about balance; everyone has personal time. \n\nBut the key here is that the girlfriend is feeling left out. The author's gaming time isn't inherently wrong, but if it's causing her distress and he's not addressing her feelings adequately, then he might be at fault. The fact that she left multiple times and he responded by telling her she doesn't need to go out might not be fostering a solution. Instead of dismissing her, maybe he should have discussed finding a middle ground. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not taking her feelings into account properly and not being flexible. The answer could be A. But I need to check if there's any nuance I missed. The author tried to communicate, but perhaps not effectively. The girlfriend's need for attention is valid, and the author's refusal to adjust might be an issue. Therefore, A (the author is in the wrong) seems correct.\n"
