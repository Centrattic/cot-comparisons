We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who wants to make plans whenever the author wants to play games. The author thinks she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, but she's upset because she feels left out or has nothing to do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions they live together now and had different routines before. When they first started dating, he gave up his free time for dates, but now they're cohabiting, so maybe the dynamics have changed. He's trying to reclaim some personal time for gaming with friends. That's understandable because everyone needs some personal space and hobbies. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend feels neglected. She wants to be included or have her own plans, which she perceives as a way to not be left alone. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to go out and can just chill on her phone. But maybe she needs more than that\u2014maybe she wants quality time or feels that when he's gaming, there's no real interaction. \n\nThe author's argument is that gaming isn't a \"plan,\" so she doesn't need to make one. But if she expects to spend time with him and now he's doing something else, she might feel like he's pulling away. The fact that she went to her sister's house might indicate she felt rejected or needed space. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to balance his own interests with the relationship. It's possible he's not wrong in wanting to play games, especially since they're not exclusive. But communication is key here. The girlfriend's needs for attention and inclusion should be considered. \n\nThe author's solution of telling her to use her phone might not address her emotional needs. Maybe she wants more than just passive presence. The problem might be that they haven't found a middle ground yet. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance. He's not wrong for wanting to play games, but he might not be fully understanding her emotional response. The issue might be more about communication and finding a compromise rather than one side being entirely wrong. \n\nBut according to the question, the options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). Considering that both need to find a solution, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could be more empathetic. The answer might lean towards B, but there's some nuance here. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and the options are binary, the answer is likely B. No, he's not in the wrong for wanting to game, but there's room for better communication.\n"
