We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. The author wants to play video games, especially with friends, and he's telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. The girlfriend is upset because she feels like she's left with nothing to do when he's playing, and she wants him to plan ahead so she can go out or do things. The author is saying he just wants to chill and that she can use her phone or laptop while he plays.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been giving up his free time for dates and couple activities before they moved in. Now that they live together, he's trying to reclaim some personal time for gaming. That's understandable. People need their own hobbies and downtime. But the girlfriend is feeling neglected because when he's gaming, she's stuck at home with nothing to do. She might be looking for some independence or time to do her own thing, hence wanting to make plans when he's busy.\n\nThe author told her she doesn't need to make plans, just relax on her phone or laptop. But maybe that's not what she wants. She might prefer going out to being cooped up at home. So the conflict is about personal space and expectations. The author thinks it's okay for her to stay home, but she feels like she needs to have plans. \n\nIs the author wrong for not accommodating her need to go out? Well, communication is key here. The author did try to tell her he was going to game, but when she wanted to make plans, he dismissed it by saying she doesn't need to go out. Maybe he should have acknowledged her feelings more and found a middle ground. For example, maybe they could have some dedicated gaming time where she can do her own thing, but also set aside time for couple activities. The fact that she went to her sister's house when he was gaming suggests she felt left out, so the author might not have considered her emotional needs adequately.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to his own hobbies and interests. It's not fair if she's expecting him to stop gaming entirely. But he also needs to be considerate of her needs. The problem seems to be a mismatch in expectations. The author might be in the wrong for not being more empathetic and not finding a solution that works for both of them. Instead of telling her she doesn't need to make plans, he could have asked her what she prefers or compromised by setting times for gaming and times for being together. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he dismissed her feelings and didn't find a balanced solution. He needs to consider her need for personal time and activities outside of when he's gaming, rather than just assuming she's okay with just staying home. Communication and compromise are essential here, and he might not have done enough of that.\n"
