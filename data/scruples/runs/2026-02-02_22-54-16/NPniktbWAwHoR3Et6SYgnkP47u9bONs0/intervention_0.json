We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend wanting to make plans whenever he wants to game, and he's saying she doesn't need to. \n\nFirst, the couple has been together for three years and lives together. The main issue starts when they move in together, and the guy wants to play games with friends. The girlfriend feels neglected because when he plays, she has nothing to do. She wants to make her own plans then, but he argues she doesn't have to go out just because he's gaming.\n\nFrom the description, the girlfriend seems to be seeking attention and wants to be involved. The author mentions she wants constant attention, which might be a clue. However, he also states he's okay with that but also wants time to game. The key here is communication and mutual respect. \n\nThe problem arises when the girlfriend starts making plans every time he wants to play, leading to arguments. The author's response is to tell her she doesn't need to go out. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should have their needs met. Gaming is his personal time, and it's reasonable for him to want that. However, if his gaming is causing the girlfriend to feel neglected, there's a balance to find. The author's solution is practical\u2014suggesting she can relax on her phone or use the laptop. But maybe the issue is deeper: the girlfriend might feel her needs aren't being prioritized enough. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything inherently wrong by wanting his personal time. The problem might be a communication gap. He could be more considerate of her feelings, but the way he's explaining it, he's trying to meet her halfway. The girlfriend's reaction seems over the top if she's making plans every time he games. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong. He's expressing his need for personal time, and the girlfriend's approach might be unrealistic. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
