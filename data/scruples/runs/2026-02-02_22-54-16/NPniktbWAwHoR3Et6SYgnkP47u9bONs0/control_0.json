We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living together where the guy wants to play video games sometimes, and his girlfriend is upset because she feels ignored. He argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The couple has been together for three years and just started living together four months ago. The guy used to spend a lot of time on dates and couple activities, and now that they live together, he's trying to get back into gaming. The girlfriend is upset because she feels like when he's gaming, she has nothing to do, and she wants him to plan ahead so she can do something else. The guy tells her she can just chill or use his laptop instead of going out, but she seems to want more interaction or plans.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When they moved in together, their dynamic changed. Before, when they were at separate houses, he had time to game, and she had her own time. Now living together, shared space and time might mean different expectations. The girlfriend is expressing that she feels neglected when he's gaming without considering her needs. The guy thinks it's not a big deal and that she can just do her own thing.\n\nThe argument arises because the girlfriend wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans, which suggests she values forewarning to manage her time. The guy, on the other hand, sees gaming as a casual activity that doesn't require formal planning. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house a few times indicates she's not happy and is taking time away, which might be a cry for attention or a way to cope with feeling ignored.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, in relationships, fairness and communication are crucial. The guy is trying to balance his personal interests with his relationship. However, the girlfriend's needs are valid too. If she feels like her time and attention are being neglected, it's a legitimate concern. The fact that he's had to tell her multiple times that she doesn't need to make plans, but she keeps feeling that she should, suggests a communication breakdown. The guy might be dismissive of her feelings, thinking she's overreacting, while she's trying to express her need for companionship or activities that she enjoys.\n\nIn the AITA context, typically, the \"wrong\" is determined by how considerate each party is of the other's feelings and needs. The boyfriend's response of telling her she can just use his laptop or relax might not be addressing her emotional needs. She might not want to be alone while he's engaged in an activity, even if he's nearby. The girlfriend's request to plan ahead is a reasonable attempt to ensure she has time for herself or other activities, which is a common need in relationships to maintain individuality and prevent feelings of neglect.\n\nTherefore, the author (the boyfriend) might not be in the wrong from a strict fairness perspective, but there's definitely room for better communication and compromise. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend is expressing her needs and the boyfriend is not considering them, maybe he is partially at fault. But in AITA contexts, sometimes both parties have valid points. However, since the question is a yes or no, I need to decide based on the standard.\n\nIn many AITA stories, if one party is not acknowledging the other's feelings or refusing to compromise, the person in the wrong is the one being dismissive. Here, the boyfriend is dismissive of her need for planned time, thinking she can just do her own thing. The girlfriend's reaction is a consequence of feeling ignored. So the boyfriend might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her need for attention and planning. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
