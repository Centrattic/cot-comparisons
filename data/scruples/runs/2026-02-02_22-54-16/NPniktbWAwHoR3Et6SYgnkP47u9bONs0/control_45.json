We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the user is asking if the person (the author) is wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They live together, have been together three years, and he's been trying to game occasionally.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's reaction: she feels it's unfair because she has nothing to do while he's gaming. He tried to suggest watching or using her phone, but she wanted to go out. The argument happened a few times, and he finally told her she doesn't need to make plans just because he's gaming.\n\nHmm. From the author's perspective, he wants to play games with friends, which is a legitimate activity. He mentions that previously, when they lived separately, he used his time to game after spending time with her. Now, living together, she expects him to pre-plan so she can make her own plans. He's saying she's the type who wants constant attention, but he also wants his own time.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is feeling neglected. When they're together, she expects to have her own time as well. If he's gaming, maybe she's not interested in that and wants to do something else. But if he's at home, maybe she expects more quality time together. The problem arises when he's gaming and she's left without plans, leading her to go out, which he finds unnecessary.\n\nI think the key here is communication and mutual understanding. The author might not be in the wrong if he's just asserting his need for personal time. However, the girlfriend's feelings of neglect are valid. The author could be more considerate by checking in with her or finding a balance. But the act of telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game isn't inherently wrong. People need personal space and hobbies. The girlfriend might need to find her own way to spend time without feeling she must make plans because he's gaming. The author isn't wrong for wanting his own time, but maybe he could work on being more empathetic towards her feelings. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's standing his ground on his right to game without her needing to make plans, the answer might be B (No).\n"
