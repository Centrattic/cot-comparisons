We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story (the author) is in the wrong. The author's girlfriend wants him to inform her in advance so she can make plans when he wants to game, but the author thinks she doesn't need to go out every time. He's fine with her relaxing on her phone or using the laptop instead.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live together, and the author plays games with friends. The girlfriend feels neglected when he's gaming because she has no plans and nothing to do. The author thinks that's okay; he's not going anywhere and they can talk while he plays. The girlfriend expects him to plan his game time so she can make her own plans, which he resents because she then blames him if she doesn't manage to do something. The author argues that she doesn't have to go out but can just relax on her phone, but she doesn't like that.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From the author's perspective, he's giving up his free time for their time together and now wants some personal time. The girlfriend wants him to prioritize her plans over his gaming. The key here is about mutual respect and communication. \n\nThe author says he's okay with the girlfriend wanting attention, but he also wants time for himself. The problem is when she leaves the house for a few hours each time he plays, which might be a sign of her feeling upset or neglected. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners need to consider each other's needs. The author might be in the right in wanting personal time, but he might be in the wrong if he's not adequately addressing her feelings of neglect. However, the girlfriend's reaction (leaving for hours) might also be an overreaction. The author's argument that she can just relax on her phone is valid, but maybe she needs more than just passive relaxation. \n\nI think it's a balance. The author isn't wrong for wanting his own time, but he might not be fully addressing her emotional needs. However, the girlfriend's approach of making plans every time he plays could be unrealistic. The answer likely depends on whether both sides are communicating effectively. Since the author tried to explain he's not going anywhere and offered alternatives, maybe he's not in the wrong. But there's room for both to adjust. The key is mutual understanding. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I lean towards B (No), but there's nuance here.\n"
