We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend wanting them to plan their gaming time in advance so she can make her own plans, but the author doesn't think she needs to go out every time they game.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. They live together, been dating three years. The guy used to game alone when they were separate, now they live together. The girlfriend feels it's not fair if he just plays games without her making plans. She goes to her sister's house when he's gaming. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans, just relax and use her phone or laptop.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend is feeling left out or neglected when he plays games, maybe expecting more shared time. The author is expressing his need for personal downtime with friends. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author tried to tell her in advance, but she's still upset. Maybe the issue is about expectations. The girlfriend might feel that when they live together, his gaming time is taking away from their shared time, especially if they previously spent time together. The author, however, wants to maintain his hobbies and social connections.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, everyone has the right to personal time. It's reasonable to have hobbies. But maybe he's not considering her feelings enough. When they live together, the dynamic changes. She might feel isolated when he's engrossed in games. However, the author is trying to find a middle ground by suggesting she can use her phone or laptop. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house multiple times could be a problem. Maybe she's using that as a way to punish him, which isn't constructive. The author's response to stop preplanning might be valid because he's not obligated to have her make plans every time he wants to game. \n\nIn relationships, balance is important. Both need to respect each other's needs. The author isn't wrong for wanting his gaming time, but maybe he should be more proactive in finding a solution that makes both comfortable. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her to do anything, just stating his position, it's more about differing needs than wrongdoing. \n\nSo, probably answer B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in communication and compromise. The main point is that personal time is acceptable, but both should work together to find a solution. The author isn't violating any rights here; it's more of a conflict in expectations.\n"
