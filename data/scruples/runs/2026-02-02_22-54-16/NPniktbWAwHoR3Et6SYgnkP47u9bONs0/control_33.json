We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. He wants to play games with friends, and she's upset because she feels she has to make plans every time he wants to game. He told her she doesn't need to make plans, but she wants him to plan ahead so she can do things. They had arguments about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that when they first got together, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates, but now they live together and he wants to game. The girlfriend's reaction is that she feels neglected when he plays games without planning, leading her to go out. The author tries to explain that she can just relax or use his laptop, but she's not happy with that.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is trying to balance his need for personal time with his girlfriend's need for attention. However, he's dismissing her feelings by saying she doesn't need to make plans. The girlfriend is feeling that her needs aren't being considered. \n\nThe author's response might not be considering her emotional needs. Even if she can technically relax, she might feel lonely or ignored when he's gaming. The author's solution of \"just relax\" might not address her deeper need for companionship or shared activities. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a balance where both partners feel their needs are met. The author is asserting his right to personal time, which is valid, but if it's causing his girlfriend stress, he should find a middle ground. The fact that she went to her sister's house for hours shows she's affected by this. The author's approach of not pre-planning might be contributing to the conflict. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's demand to pre-plan every gaming session might also be excessive. It's possible they need to communicate better to find a compromise. The author isn't entirely wrong for wanting personal time, but he might be inconsiderate in how he's handling it. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's actions are considerate. Since he's not planning ahead and dismissing her feelings, that could make him at least partially wrong. But it's a complex situation where both might have valid points. However, the question is about the author specifically. If he's not considering her feelings and just insisting on his own needs, then he's in the wrong. But if they both have some fault, maybe not entirely. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks for who is being unreasonable. Dismissing her need for attention and not making an effort to plan could be seen as the author being inconsiderate. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
