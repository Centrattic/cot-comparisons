We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their girlfriend to have to make plans every time he wants to play games. They live together now, and the girlfriend is upset because when he plays, she has nothing to do and expects him to plan their time together so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time, just relax or use her phone.\n\nFirst, I need to think about both sides. The girlfriend might feel neglected, especially since they're living together and she's used to spending time with him. When he plays games, she's left alone, which could make her feel like she's not a priority. She might be missing the quality time they had earlier in the relationship. The author, on the other hand, wants to maintain his own hobbies and social activities, which is understandable. He's trying to balance his personal needs with his relationship.\n\nBut the problem arises when the girlfriend feels she has to make plans every time he wants to game. That could lead to resentment if she feels pressurized to do something just to avoid being alone. The author's response to tell her to relax or use her phone might be dismissive of her feelings. Even if she's the type who wants constant attention, the author might be overlooking her emotional needs here.\n\nHowever, the author is also expressing his need for personal time, which is important in a relationship. Healthy relationships require compromise. The key is whether the author is being considerate of her feelings while asserting his own. He did give her options, but she might not feel comfortable with just watching him play or being on her phone. Maybe they need to find a middle ground, like setting specific times for gaming versus couple time.\n\nBut according to the question, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The user might see that the girlfriend's expectations are unreasonable, expecting her to plan something every time he wants to play. The author is just trying to maintain his hobbies without forcing her to make plans. However, the author could have been more empathetic in his response. Instead of dismissing her by suggesting she just relax, maybe he should have acknowledged her feelings and found a better compromise.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the \"wrong\" is often determined by how balanced the approach is. If the author is being selfish, he's in the wrong. If he's asserting his needs in a respectful way, maybe not. The girlfriend's reaction is also important. She went to her sister's house and started arguments, which might indicate she's overreacting. But the author's refusal to plan around her needs could be part of the problem. \n\nThe author's defense is that he wants to maintain his gaming without forcing her to do something. But if she's feeling neglected, even if she has her phone, it's not the same as having someone to interact with. The author could have considered her feelings more, like maybe setting aside specific gaming times when they can be together, or finding activities they can do together. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he's being inconsiderate, then A. But if he's just trying to maintain his hobbies without forcing her, maybe B. However, the fact that he dismissed her feelings by telling her to use her phone might lean towards A, because communication and empathy are important. So maybe A is the answer, but I need to be sure.\n"
