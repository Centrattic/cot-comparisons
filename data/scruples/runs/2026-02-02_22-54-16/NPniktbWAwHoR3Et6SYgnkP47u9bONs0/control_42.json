We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living together, where the guy wants to play games, and the girlfriend expects him to plan so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend is upset because she feels neglected when he plays games without planning. She wants to have her own time when he's busy. The author thinks it's unfair that she has to make plans every time he plays, especially since they live together and he's not going out. He's saying she can just relax and do her own thing instead of going out.\n\nSo, communication is a key issue here. When they moved in together, maybe their expectations weren't aligned. The author mentions that they used to spend time apart before, but now they're living together, so maybe there's a shift in how they spend time. The girlfriend might feel that since they're living together, his gaming time is taking up space she expected to have for herself. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, suggesting she can just relax. But maybe the girlfriend feels that without planning, she ends up with nothing to do and ends up feeling lonely. The author might not realize how his gaming time affects her emotionally. \n\nIt's also about mutual respect and compromise. If the author is taking time away from their shared time without considering her feelings, that's a problem. But if he's communicating that he wants some downtime and she's overreacting, that's another angle. However, the girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might indicate she's not getting her needs met, so maybe the author needs to adjust.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: he's trying to assert his need for personal time (gaming with friends), she's feeling neglected and wants her own time. Both have valid points. The author's mistake might be not discussing this in a more collaborative way, instead of just dismissing her need for plans. By saying she doesn't need to go out, he might be undermining her effort to communicate her needs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend is being unreasonable, expecting him to plan his gaming so she can go out. But since they live together, his personal time affects her. The author could have found a middle ground, like setting specific times for gaming where she knows she can have her own time, or finding activities they can do together. His response of telling her to just chill on her phone might not be sufficient if she needs more than that.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate and find a balance. The author's answer might be that he's not wrong because he's expressing his need for personal time, but he could also be wrong for not addressing her feelings properly. The fact that it's leading to arguments suggests that neither is fully right, but the question is about the author specifically. \n\nSince the girlfriend is expressing her need for attention and the author is not meeting that by gaming without planning, maybe the author is partially at fault. But if he's also valid in needing personal time, it's a bit of a grey area. However, in the context of AITA, often the person is in the wrong if they're not considering their partner's feelings. The author's response of dismissing her need for plans (saying she doesn't need to go out) might be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
