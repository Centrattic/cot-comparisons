We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend living together. He wants to play video games with friends, and she's upset because she feels neglected when he's gaming. He argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game, suggesting she can just relax or use her phone. She, on the other hand, feels that if he's going to be busy, she should have her own time to do something else.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been in a 3-year relationship and mentions that he used to game when they were in separate houses. Now that they live together, the dynamics have changed. He's trying to maintain some personal time, which is understandable. But his girlfriend is upset because she feels like she's not getting enough attention. The key issue here is communication and expectations.\n\nThe author says he gave her advanced notice sometimes, but she still felt the need to make plans, and when she didn't, she blamed him. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't have to go out, just relax. It sounds like there's a mismatch in their expectations of how to spend their time together. The girlfriend might be seeking more quality time as a couple, while the author wants some alone time for his hobby.\n\nIn relationships, balance is important. Both partners need to have their needs met. The fact that the author is willing to spend time with his girlfriend when he's done gaming shows he's trying to compromise. However, the girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house indicates she's unhappy with the current arrangement. The author's approach of letting her know he's gaming and suggesting she uses her phone or laptop could be seen as dismissive. Maybe he could have asked her how she feels about the situation instead of assuming she's okay with just being around.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's expectation that he should plan all his gaming time in advance so she can make her own plans might be a bit much. It's unrealistic to think every instance of gaming needs a prearranged plan. The author's hobby is a legitimate activity, and it's his right to want some personal time. That said, maybe there's a middle ground where they communicate better about their schedules and needs.\n\nThe author's argument that he's not going anywhere and they can talk while he plays might not address her deeper need for companionship. If she feels neglected, even if he's physically present, it's a valid concern. The author might be overlooking her emotional needs by not engaging more actively. However, he's also not in the wrong for wanting to have his own interests. The answer really depends on whether the author is being inconsiderate of her feelings or if she's being unreasonable in her demands.\n\nGiven that the author is trying to communicate and compromise, and the girlfriend is reacting strongly, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong. The situation seems more like a communication issue rather than one party being clearly at fault. The answer would likely be B (No) because the author is trying to balance his needs and hers, even if there's room for improvement in their communication.\n"
