We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting them to plan their gaming time so she can have plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays games.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that they live together now, so maybe the dynamics have changed from when they were living separately. When they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates, but now they're together more. The girlfriend seems to feel left out when he's gaming, wanting to make plans instead of just staying home. She went to her sister's house a few times after these gaming sessions, which might indicate she's feeling neglected or not included.\n\nThe author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans each time he plays, suggesting she can just relax. He also mentions she wants constant attention, which he's okay with, but also wants time for himself with friends. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to balance his personal time with his girlfriend's needs. The problem arises when his gaming time becomes a point of conflict because she feels left out. However, he's not doing anything harmful; gaming is a normal activity. The issue might be more about how they communicate their needs to each other.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014leaving to go to her sister's\u2014could be a way of expressing her feelings, but maybe she should have discussed it calmly instead of reacting emotionally. On the other hand, the author could have been more considerate, maybe setting aside specific times for gaming versus couple time. But he did mention giving her advanced notice, so he's trying to be accommodating.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to feel heard and respected. If the author is making her feel like her needs aren't being met, then he might be at fault. But if they're both trying to find a balance, maybe it's a misunderstanding. The author isn't forcing her to do anything; he's just expressing that she doesn't need to make plans every time. However, her constant need for plans could be a deeper issue, like feeling insecure or not connected when he's gaming.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because he's asserting his need for personal time. However, he could improve by checking in with her feelings and finding a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not being malicious and is trying to balance both their needs, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). The main issue is communication, not necessarily one person being wrong.\n"
