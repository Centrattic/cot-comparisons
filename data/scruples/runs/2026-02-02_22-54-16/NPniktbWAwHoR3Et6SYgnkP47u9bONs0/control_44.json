We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting to make plans whenever he wants to play games, and he's pushing back against that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for three years and lives together now. The author used to spend his alone time gaming, but now that they live together, the girlfriend is upset when he plays games without making plans for her. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, just relax or use her phone. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels neglected and wants quality time with him.\n\nThe main issue here is the conflict between personal time and partner's expectations. The author wants to game with friends, which is a valid need for socializing and relaxation. The girlfriend wants companionship during that time. The author is resisting the idea that he has to plan something for her every time he plays, which could be seen as a reasonable stance because he's not obligated to do so. However, the girlfriend might feel that her needs are not being met if he's engrossed in gaming without considering her.\n\nI should consider relationship dynamics. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel valued and heard. The author's initial response was to suggest she watch him play, which he said was a joke, but the girlfriend took it seriously. Then, when she wanted to make plans, he dismissed it by saying she can just relax on her phone. This might come off as dismissive of her emotional needs. The girlfriend going to her sister's house could indicate she's feeling isolated or neglected.\n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend blames him when she doesn't make her plans, which suggests a pattern of her holding him responsible for her not having enough to do. That's a bit on her, but the author's approach of not making efforts to include her might contribute to her feeling left out. The author's argument is that he's not going anywhere and they can have quality time later, but maybe the girlfriend needs more immediate attention.\n\nIt's a balance between personal hobbies and partner's needs. The author isn't wrong for wanting time to himself, but perhaps he could find a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling neglected, but the author is also expressing his needs. Since the author is not forcing her to do something, but rather defending his right to have personal time, it's a matter of communication and compromise. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's communicating his needs but might need to adjust how he approaches the situation to consider her feelings more.\n"
