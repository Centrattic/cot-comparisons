We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. He's been gaming a lot, and she's upset that he doesn't preplan his gaming sessions so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays and that she can just relax. She, on the other hand, feels neglected because when he's gaming, she has nothing to do.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author mentions that he's been spending a lot of time with her since they first got together, and he gave up his free time for dates. Now that they live together, maybe the balance has shifted. The girlfriend is asking for some independence or time for herself, but the author is reluctant to preplan his gaming time, which is a significant part of his social life with friends.\n\nThe author's argument is that he isn't making a formal plan when he plays games, just relaxing with friends. But the girlfriend sees it as a planned activity that takes away from their time together. She wants to have her own plans when he's busy, but if she doesn't make them, she blames him. The author suggests she can just use her phone or his laptop, but that might not be satisfying for her.\n\nIt's important to consider both sides. The author might be used to having gaming as a solo activity, but when living with a partner, shared space and time can lead to conflicts. The girlfriend might need more structured time to herself, and the author's gaming without notice disrupts that. However, the author also has the right to maintain some hobbies and social activities.\n\nThe key issue here is the expectation of preplanning. The girlfriend wants to know in advance so she can make her own plans. The author is resistant to that, thinking she doesn't need to go out. But maybe the problem is that both have different needs: she wants to be included or to have her own time, and he wants to game without feeling guilty. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's not entirely wrong because he has a right to his hobbies. But he might be inconsiderate by not accommodating her need for preplanning. If he's aware that his gaming is causing her to feel neglected, then communication and compromise are necessary. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's might be extreme, but her feelings are valid if she's feeling left out. The author's solution of telling her to relax on her phone might not address her deeper need for connection or her own activities.\n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong. However, both could benefit from better communication. The author's refusal to preplan might contribute to the issue, but it's a mutual problem. The answer might be B, No, but there's room for both to adjust.\n"
