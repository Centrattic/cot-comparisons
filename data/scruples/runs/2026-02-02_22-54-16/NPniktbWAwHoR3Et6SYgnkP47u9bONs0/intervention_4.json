We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who wants to game with friends, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels left out and wants to make plans when he's gaming. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he plays.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions they've been together three years and live together for four months. He used to give up his free time for dates but now wants to game. His girlfriend is upset because when he's gaming, she has nothing to do. He tried to suggest she watch him play or use her phone, but she preferred to go out. She ended up going to her sister's house each time, leading to arguments.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is trying to balance his personal time with his relationship. Gaming is a social activity for him with friends, which is a legitimate need for many people. However, his girlfriend might feel neglected if he's immersed in his own activity without considering her needs. The author isn't forcing her to spend time with him, but she's expecting some level of planning so she can enjoy her own time without feeling left out.\n\nThe author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans every time. That could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even though he's not wrong to want his own time, communication is crucial. Maybe he should have discussed finding a middle ground, like setting specific times for gaming where she knows she can have her own plans, and other times where they can be together. The fact that she went to her sister's house each time and he continued gaming without considering her feelings might indicate that he didn't validate her emotions enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's expectation that he should plan his gaming so she can plan her own activities might be unrealistic if he's just gaming casually with friends. The author isn't obligated to inform her every time unless it's a scheduled event. However, mutual respect and understanding are important in a relationship. The author's initial reaction of suggesting she watch him play or use her phone might not be enough if she prefers solitude or activities outside the home.\n\nConsidering all this, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting to game, he might have handled the situation better by acknowledging her feelings and finding a compromise. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from feeling neglected, but the author's need for personal time is also valid. The core issue is about communication and finding a balance that works for both. Since the author didn't provide a clear answer but rather a situation where both sides have valid points, it's a bit tricky. But given the options, the author might not be in the wrong because he's asserting his need for personal time, but there's room for improvement in how he communicates and considers his partner's perspective.\n"
