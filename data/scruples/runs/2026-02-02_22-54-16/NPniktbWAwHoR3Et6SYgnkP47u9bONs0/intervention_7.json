We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple living together, and the guy wants to play video games with friends. The girlfriend is upset because she feels left out and wants to have plans when he's gaming. The guy argues that she doesn't need to make plans just because he wants to play.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel neglected if the only time they spend apart is when he's gaming. She might want to have her own activities to avoid feeling lonely. On the other hand, the guy has a right to his personal time, especially since they're living together and he's contributing to the relationship by being there otherwise.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The guy is trying to explain that he's not going anywhere and they can still spend time together later. The girlfriend, however, feels that she's not getting enough attention if he's gaming without her. It's possible that she's used to having more one-on-one time and the sudden change in their dynamic is causing stress.\n\nThe guy's response to tell her she doesn't need to make plans every time he games is about his right to personal time. But maybe he could have been more empathetic in acknowledging her feelings. He did try to compromise by suggesting she could watch him play or use her phone, but that didn't work for her.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, it's a balance. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but so is his need for personal time. The core issue might be their communication. The guy's approach might come off as dismissive if he's not considering her emotional needs. However, he's not entirely wrong in wanting to have his own space. It's a common conflict in relationships where personal time versus couple time is negotiated.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's asserting his need for personal time, but there's definitely room for better communication and understanding both sides. The problem isn't one-sided, but the question is if he's in the wrong. Since both have valid points, the main issue is how they handle the communication.\n"
