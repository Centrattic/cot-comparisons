We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. The main points here are about their living arrangement and the conflict around gaming time.\n\nFirst, they've been together for three years and live together now. The author mentions that when they first got together, he gave up his free time for dates and couple activities. Now, when they live together, he wants to game in the evening. The girlfriend's reaction was that it's unfair because she has nothing else to do while he's gaming. She expects him to plan ahead if he wants to game so she can make her own plans. The author then tells her she doesn't need to go out, just chill on her phone or use the laptop. She's described as wanting constant attention, which the author is okay with, but he also wants to play with friends online.\n\nThe core issue seems to be communication and expectations around shared living space and personal time. The girlfriend might feel neglected when he's gaming, especially if they used to spend time together. Now that they live together, she expects him to coordinate his activities so she can have her own time. The author, on the other hand, sees gaming as a way to relax and doesn't want to feel like he needs to plan around her every time.\n\nThe key here is mutual understanding. In a relationship, especially when cohabiting, both partners need to feel their needs are met. The author's point that she doesn't need to go out is valid; he can't be blamed for wanting to play games. However, the fact that he didn't consider her feelings and expectations initially might be the problem. The girlfriend's request for preplanning isn't unreasonable if she wants to have her own activities. The author's response was dismissive, which could lead to feeling ignored. But it's also his right to have hobbies and personal time.\n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the author's gaming is intruding on their quality time or if it's just personal time when she can do her own thing. Since the girlfriend is okay with him playing games but wants to not be left without plans, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to game. However, a better approach would be to find a compromise and communicate more effectively to meet her needs without feeling restricted. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in their approach.\n"
