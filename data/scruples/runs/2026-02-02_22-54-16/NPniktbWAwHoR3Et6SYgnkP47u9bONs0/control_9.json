We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living together where the guy wants to play games, and his girlfriend expects him to plan so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to plan every time he wants to game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that when they first dated, he gave up his free time for their dates, but now that they live together, he wants to play games. The girlfriend's reaction is that she feels left out and needs to have her own activities when he's gaming. She went to her sister's house, which might indicate she felt neglected.\n\nThe author says he told her she could watch him play, but she wanted her own plans. He's okay with her relaxing on her phone or using the laptop. The girlfriend seems to want more attention, but the author wants time to game with friends. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to explain that he's not going anywhere and they can talk while he plays. However, the girlfriend's frustration suggests she might need more quality time together rather than him being absorbed in games. The author's response of \"she doesn\u2019t need to go out every time\" might come off as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nHe also mentions she blamed him when she didn't make plans, which could indicate she's trying to manage her time but feels he's not considerate. The core issue is balancing personal space and couple time. The author wants his gaming time, but the girlfriend might feel that time is taking away from their togetherness. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because everyone should have some personal time. However, not considering her feelings enough might be an issue. He could be more proactive in ensuring she feels included. Maybe suggesting activities they can do together during his gaming time instead of just dismissing her need for plans. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a grey area. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations in their relationship. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I need to decide if his actions were unreasonable. He's not forcing her to leave, but his response might not address her emotional needs. Maybe a B (No) because he's not in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because he's not fully considering her feelings. \n\nHmm. The key points are: he gave up time for her before, now she expects planning. He's trying to balance his interests, but she's not getting the attention she wants. The fact that she went to her sister's shows she's upset. The author's solution of telling her to just relax on her phone might not be sufficient. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong, but there's a need for mutual understanding. The girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic if she expects him to plan every time he wants to game. However, he could be more considerate. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and he's not violating any clear boundaries, B is more appropriate.\n"
