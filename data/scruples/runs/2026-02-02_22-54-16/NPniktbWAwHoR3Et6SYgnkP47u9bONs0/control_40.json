We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author and his girlfriend living together. He wants to play games sometimes, and she expects him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, just relax on her phone or something. She feels left out and misses him when he's gaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author gave up his free time for dates initially, but now that they live together, he wants to game. The girlfriend wants to know in advance to have her own time. Communication seems to be an issue here. The author says he told her he's going to play, but she wants pre-planning. Maybe he's not considering her feelings enough. She's going to her sister's house, which might be a reaction to feeling neglected.\n\nHe mentions she's the type who wants constant attention, which might mean she's used to being involved in his activities. If he's gaming, she might feel like he's pulling away emotionally. His response of telling her to just relax on her phone might not be enough for her. She might need more attention or inclusion. The author might be in the right to want his own time, but he might not be balancing it properly with her needs. The answer probably depends on mutual understanding and compromise. Maybe both need to adjust. But according to the question, is the author in the wrong? If he's not considering her feelings and only focusing on his own needs, maybe A. But if it's a matter of differing expectations, maybe B. Hmm. I think it's a bit of both, but since the question is about the author specifically, maybe A because he's not making enough effort to accommodate her feelings. Or B if he's within his rights. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards B because he's communicating his needs and suggesting alternatives, but maybe not enough. Wait, the girlfriend is reacting strongly, but the author is trying. Maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but they need to communicate better. The key is whether his actions are unreasonable. Since he's allowing her to watch or relax, and he's not avoiding her entirely, maybe B. But if she's feeling neglected, maybe A. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. The problem is more about differing expectations and communication, not necessarily him being wrong.\n"
