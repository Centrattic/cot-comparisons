We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They live together, have been dating three years. The main issue seems to be that when they first started dating, he gave up his free time for dates, but now, living together, he wants to game with friends, and she's upset because she feels ignored when he plays.\n\nThe author says he told her he's going to play games, she wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. He argues she doesn't have to go out, just relax. The girlfriend's reaction is that she wants attention, but he wants gaming time. \n\nFrom the story, the author mentions that he's fine with her wanting constant attention but also wants to game. The key point is communication. Did he wrong by not considering her feelings? Well, in relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend feels neglected when he's gaming, he should acknowledge her feelings. But he did try to explain that she doesn't have to go out every time. \n\nHowever, the argument arises when she's making plans and blaming him if she doesn't follow through. The author's response was to say she doesn't need to go out, just relax. That seems reasonable. Maybe the girlfriend's expectations are unrealistic\u2014expecting him to always have \"plans\" for their time together. \n\nBut in a relationship, both partners need to respect each other's hobbies and time. The author is trying to balance his need for personal activity with her need for attention. His stance that gaming isn't a plan and she can just chill might be valid. The problem is more about differing expectations rather than one being wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. He's standing up for his own needs. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels neglected, but the author's response is also reasonable. The issue is more about them needing to find a middle ground rather than one being wrong.\n"
