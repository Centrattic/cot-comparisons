We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They've been together three years and now live together. The girlfriend is upset because when he plays games, she feels left out and wants to have her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out just because he's gaming, suggesting she can relax or use his laptop. She's the type who wants constant attention, but he wants to play with friends online.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that when they live together, she expects to spend time with him, and when he's gaming, she feels neglected. She wants to make plans to do something else because she misses him when they're in the same space but doing separate things. The author thinks gaming isn't a plan and that she should just relax. \n\nBut when you live together, shared space and time can be a sensitive issue. Even if he's not leaving the house, activities like gaming can be seen as taking up space and attention. The girlfriend might feel that since they're cohabiting, his gaming time is encroaching on their couple time, hence her needing to have her own plans to have some independence. \n\nThe author's response of saying she doesn't need to go out and can just use his laptop might not address her emotional need for attention and connection. She might feel that just being in the same room isn't enough, especially if she's someone who craves constant interaction. The fact that she left to her sister's house shows she felt the need to get away, which could indicate her discomfort with the situation. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because everyone needs some personal time, but he might not be considering her feelings adequately. The girlfriend's reaction could be valid if she feels her needs aren't being met. The author's dismissive attitude towards her need for separate plans might be the issue. \n\nIn relationships, balance is important. Both partners need to have their needs met. If the girlfriend feels neglected during his gaming time, the author should find a middle ground, like setting specific times for gaming and couple time, rather than insisting she doesn't need to make plans. The fact that she's trying to make plans shows she's attempting to balance her own needs with his, which the author isn't respecting. \n\nSo, the author's stance might be contributing to the conflict. He's not wrong in wanting to game, but he's not considering how his actions affect her. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not accommodating her feelings and needs.\n"
