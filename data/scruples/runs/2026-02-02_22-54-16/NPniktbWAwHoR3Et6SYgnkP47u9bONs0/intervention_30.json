We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who wants to make plans every time he wants to game, and he's saying she doesn't need to go out just because he's playing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. They've been together three years and live together now. The guy used to game alone when they were at separate houses, but now that they live together, the girlfriend is upset when he plays without planning something for her. She wants to have things to do when he's gaming, maybe expecting him to include her or plan activities so she's not left alone. The guy thinks she's overreacting and just wants constant attention, but he's okay with that normally. However, he wants to play games with friends.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and expectations. When they started living together, their dynamics changed. Before, when they were at separate houses, he could game alone without affecting her. Now, she might feel like her free time is being encroached upon when he's gaming. She's asking for plans to be made so she has something to do, which could be a way to feel included or not feel lonely.\n\nThe guy responded by telling her she doesn't need to go out every time he plays. He offers her to watch or use his laptop. But she's still upset, leading to arguments. He's trying to communicate that gaming isn't a plan they need to coordinate, but she's taking it as him not considering her needs.\n\nIs he wrong? Well, in a relationship, communication is key. If both partners have different needs, they need to find a middle ground. The guy wants to game with friends, the girlfriend wants to feel included or have her own plans. The problem is the girlfriend is making it conditional that when he wants to game, she has to have plans, which he's not okay with. \n\nBut maybe there's a misunderstanding. The girlfriend might feel neglected when he's gaming without her. The guy might not realize that her need for plans is a way to cope with feeling left out. However, he's also trying to maintain his own hobbies and autonomy. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction could stem from feeling that her needs aren't being considered. If she's used to having his attention and now that he's gaming more, she's adjusting to the new living situation. On the other hand, the guy is trying to set boundaries and maintain his interests. \n\nThe question is whether the guy is wrong for not making plans every time he wants to game. If the girlfriend is expecting that, and he's unilaterally deciding otherwise, that could be an issue. However, if they haven't had a proper discussion to align their expectations, the problem might be both sides not communicating effectively. \n\nBut according to the story, the guy tried to explain that it's not a plan and offered alternatives. The girlfriend still went to her sister's house, which might indicate she felt upset and needed space. The guy's point is that she's overreacting, but maybe she's just feeling like her needs aren't being met. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's needs. The guy's hobby is important, but the girlfriend's need for inclusion or independent plans might also be valid. If the guy dismisses her feelings as overreaction, that could be where he's in the wrong. However, if he's trying to communicate his boundaries, he might not be in the wrong either. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the girlfriend's expectations are unreasonable. If she's asking him to plan activities for her just because he wants to game, that might be too much. But if she's just asking to have her own time while he's gaming, which he offered by saying she can use the laptop or phone, maybe she's not in the wrong either. \n\nThe key issue here is mutual understanding. The guy might not be in the wrong if he's respecting her by suggesting she can do her own thing while he games. However, if the girlfriend's expectations are about being included in the activity or having planned activities when he's not available, that's where miscommunication happens. \n\nGiven that the guy is trying to maintain his autonomy and the girlfriend is struggling with adjustment, the answer might lean towards the guy not being in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's actions are causing unnecessary conflict, maybe he should adjust. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the answer usually hinges on whether one party is being unreasonable. The girlfriend is expecting plans every time he wants to game, which might be excessive. The guy is trying to set boundaries and maintain his hobbies, which is reasonable. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but there's room for both sides to adjust. However, based on the information given, the guy's stance is more about maintaining his own space, which is acceptable.\n"
