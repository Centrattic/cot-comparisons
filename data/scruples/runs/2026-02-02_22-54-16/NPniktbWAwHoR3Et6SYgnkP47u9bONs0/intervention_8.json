We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to make plans every time he wants to play video games, which his girlfriend expects him to do so she can have her own plans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that when they first got together, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates. Now that they live together, he wants to game with friends. The girlfriend is upset because she feels left out when he plays games and wants to have her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time and can just relax or use her phone.\n\nLooking at communication, the author tried to explain that he's not going anywhere and offered to talk while he plays. However, the girlfriend still felt neglected. The key points here are mutual respect and understanding each other's needs. The author wants his gaming time, which is a personal hobby, and the girlfriend is seeking attention or a balance in their time together.\n\nThe author isn't forcing her to leave, but the girlfriend is using the gaming time as an opportunity to have her own plans. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans every time. From a fairness perspective, the author is defending his right to have personal time, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend's feelings of being left out are valid and should be addressed through communication.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not accommodating her need to have her own plans whenever he games. The author's stance is that she can relax or use her phone, which is practical. But if the girlfriend's need for attention isn't being met during the time he's gaming, maybe they need to find a middle ground. However, the author isn't wrong for wanting his personal time. So, considering all factors, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
