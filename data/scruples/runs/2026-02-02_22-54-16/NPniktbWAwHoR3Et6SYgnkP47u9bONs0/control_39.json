We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together three years and live together now. The girlfriend is upset when he plays games without making plans for her to do something else. She feels it's unfair because she has nothing to do while he's gaming. He offered her to watch him play, but she insists on making her own plans, and when she doesn't, she blames him. He argues she doesn't need to go out each time and can just relax on her phone or use his laptop.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend might feel neglected when he's gaming without considering her need for attention or activities. The author is trying to balance his own interests with her needs, but there's a conflict in expectations. The author is suggesting she doesn't have to make plans, but she might feel that her needs aren't being respected when he's engrossed in gaming.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, both have valid points. The author wants to play games with friends, which is understandable. However, the girlfriend is expressing her need for attention and not being considered in his plans. The author might be dismissive of her feelings by suggesting she can just use her phone or laptop. Maybe he should have been more proactive in finding a middle ground, like setting specific game times when she can do her own thing, or engaging in activities together.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his actions are disregarding her emotional needs. If he's not making an effort to include her or consider her feelings, that could be the issue. However, he does mention that he's okay with her wanting constant attention, but also wants his own time. It's a balance. The fact that she left to her sister's house multiple times might indicate she's feeling neglected, which could reflect poor communication from both sides.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about mutual responsibility. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong specifically. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his right to have personal time. But maybe he should have considered her feelings more. However, the girlfriend's reaction of leaving to her sister's house and blaming him if she doesn't make plans might show she's overreacting. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. So, perhaps B is the answer, but it's a bit nuanced. I need to decide if his actions are objectively wrong. Since he's not forcing her to do anything and is allowing her to relax, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's being dismissive, maybe A. But the key is that he's telling her she doesn't need to make plans, which is a boundary. So B.\n"
