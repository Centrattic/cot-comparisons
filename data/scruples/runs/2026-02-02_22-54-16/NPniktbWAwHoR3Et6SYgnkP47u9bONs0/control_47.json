We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. The author wants to play video games, especially with friends online, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels like she has to make plans every time he wants to game. She wants to be included or have her own plans when he's gaming, otherwise she feels left out. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans just because he's playing and that she can just relax.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main point is that he's been giving up his free time for dates and now wants to play games with friends. He's telling the girlfriend she doesn't have to make plans, but she's upset because she feels neglected. She might be feeling that when they live together, his gaming time is a way to avoid spending quality time with her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to balance his need for personal time with her need for attention. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that her needs aren't being met. She wants to be involved in his activities or have her own things to do, but maybe she expects more from him. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author might not be in the wrong if he's clearly stating his needs and she's not respecting them. However, if he's not considering her feelings and not finding a middle ground, he might share some responsibility. \n\nThe author mentions that he told her she didn't need to go out, just relax. But if she's feeling that she needs to have her own plans to not feel lonely, then maybe he's not acknowledging her need for space or activities. However, he's also within his rights to want his own time. The problem seems to be that their expectations aren't aligned. \n\nMaybe the author is being a little dismissive when he says she doesn't need to plan, not recognizing that she might have different needs. But it's also possible that she's overreacting and expecting him to plan for her. Without more context, like if there's a history of neglect or if she's making excessive demands, it's hard to say. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If the author is being clear about his needs but isn't considering hers, maybe he's part of the problem. On the flip side, she might need to communicate better why she feels that way. The answer might depend on whether the author is being reasonable in his stance or not. Since he's trying to have his own time and she's trying to have hers, maybe he's not in the wrong, but there's room for both to adjust. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), because the author is asserting his right to have personal time and is not making her do things she doesn't want to. However, the situation could benefit from better communication and understanding from both sides.\n"
