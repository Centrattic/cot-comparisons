We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he and his girlfriend live together. He wants to play games with his friends, and he tells her he's going to do that. She feels like she can't do anything unless they make plans together, so she's getting upset when he plays games without planning something else for her to do. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans just because he wants to game.\n\nFirst, communication seems like a big part here. The girlfriend is feeling left out or neglected when he's gaming. She wants some time to do her own thing but maybe feels like when he's gaming, she's supposed to be doing something else. The author, on the other hand, wants to have his own time playing with friends and isn't seeing her perspective as clearly. He mentions she wants constant attention, which he's okay with, but he also needs his own space for gaming.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and understanding. If the girlfriend is feeling like her needs aren't met, especially after living together for four months, that's something they should discuss. The author dismissed her feelings initially, saying she could watch him play, which he thought was a joke. But she took it seriously, indicating she's not just looking for something to do but might feel like her time alone isn't valid unless planned. \n\nThe author's response to her, telling her she can just relax or use his laptop, might not address her underlying feelings of needing her own space or activities. It's possible that she feels he's not considering her feelings when he spends time with friends, leading to the argument. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should have their needs met. If gaming is important to him, she should feel supported, but she also needs her own time and activities. The author's initial reaction was to dismiss her concerns, which could be seen as not respecting her feelings. However, his point about not needing to plan every time he wants to game is valid because he shouldn't have to constantly accommodate her every time he wants personal time. \n\nBut the issue is the recurring argument and her feeling that if he's busy, she has to be busy too. The author's advice to her was to relax, which might not be what she needs. Maybe she wants some alone time but in a structured way, or maybe she's using the gaming as an excuse for deeper issues. \n\nUltimately, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for not planning when he wants to game. Given that he's making an effort to communicate, but the girlfriend is still upset, it's a balance. The author is not entirely wrong because he has a right to his hobbies, but he might be missing the mark on addressing her emotional needs. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend is the one initiating the conflict over plans, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not accommodating her every time. But if his response is dismissive, he could be part of the problem. \n\nHmm, but the question is AITA. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are wrong. Since he's standing his ground and she's the one who's upset, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but the situation needs better communication from both sides. The author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the girlfriend is overreacting, then the author isn't wrong. If the author isn't respecting her feelings, then he is. But based on the info given, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is not in the wrong because he's trying to balance his needs and hers, but he could be more considerate.\n"
