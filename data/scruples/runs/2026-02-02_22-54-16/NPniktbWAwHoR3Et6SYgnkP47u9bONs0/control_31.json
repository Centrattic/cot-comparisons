We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting to make plans every time he wants to game, and the author telling her she doesn't need to. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions they've been together three years and live together now. He says he's given up a lot of free time before for their relationship, but now he's trying to game with friends. The girlfriend's issue is that when he's gaming, she has nothing to do, so she wants to make plans to be busy. He argues that she doesn't need to go out specifically because he's gaming, that she can just chill on her phone or use the laptop.\n\nSo, the core issue is communication and expectations. The girlfriend might feel neglected when he's engrossed in gaming and wants her to be occupied. The author is trying to balance his own need for downtime with her need for companionship. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans every time, which might have come off as dismissive. He also gave her advanced notice, but she still felt the need to go out. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house for hours shows she's not comfortable being alone while he's gaming. \n\nThe author says she's a girl who wants constant attention, which might be a valid point, but he also wants time for himself. However, not everyone can be comfortable with alone time or screen time during a partner's activity. \n\nMaybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings fully and dismissed her need to have plans. Telling her she doesn't need to go out might have invalidated her request for attention. They need to find a middle ground, like setting specific gaming times or finding activities they can do together. \n\nAlternatively, the author isn't in the wrong because everyone needs personal time. But the way he handled the situation might have been abrupt. It's a balance issue. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't address her feelings adequately and his response was dismissive. They need better communication, but his approach wasn't considerate enough.\n"
