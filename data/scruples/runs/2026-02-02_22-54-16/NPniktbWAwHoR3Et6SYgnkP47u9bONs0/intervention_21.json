We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author playing video games while living with their girlfriend, and her wanting to have plans whenever he wants to game. The author says they've been together three years and live together now. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's reaction: she feels it's unfair for him to play games when she has nothing to do. She wants him to make plans in advance so she can go out or be busy. The author responds by saying she doesn't need to go out, just relax or use his laptop. The girlfriend ends up going to her sister's house, and the argument repeats a couple times.\n\nSo, the key points are about communication and expectations. When they live separately, he had time for games when she wasn't there. Now that they live together, she expects him to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans. The author thinks she wants constant attention but wants his time for gaming. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not wrong for wanting to play games with friends, but maybe not considering her feelings. She might feel neglected when he's gaming, especially since they're living together. The author could be seen as not acknowledging her need for personal time or social activities. But he's also not wrong for wanting to maintain his hobby. \n\nThe problem here is communication. They need to find a balance. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to go out every time might come off as dismissive. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can set aside time for each other and time for individual activities. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a 50/50. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to play games, but he could be missing her emotional needs. Similarly, the girlfriend isn't in the wrong for feeling left out. However, the question is specifically about the author. Since he's not violating any clear boundaries and is expressing his needs, but the way he's handling the conflict might be lacking empathy, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance here. \n\nIn the end, I think both sides have valid points. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to game, but maybe he could be more considerate. The answer is B.\n"
