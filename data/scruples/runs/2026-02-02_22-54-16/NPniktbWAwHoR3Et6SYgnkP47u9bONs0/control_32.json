We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together and have been for three years. The issue started when the author wanted to play Apex Legends with his friend, and his girlfriend was upset because he didn't plan ahead for her to have something to do while he was playing. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game, but she feels neglected and wants him to preplan so she can have her own time. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that he gave up a lot of his free time in the beginning of their relationship for dates and couple activities. Now that they live together, he's trying to reclaim some personal time by gaming. He also points out that he's not going anywhere and is available to talk while he plays. However, his girlfriend feels that she's being ignored and wants to have her own activities when he's busy. \n\nCommunication seems to be a big part here. The author says he had a conversation where he told her she could watch him play or use his laptop, but she wasn't happy. The problem arises when she expects him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. The author's response was that she doesn't have to go out every time and can just relax. \n\nI think the key here is about mutual understanding and compromise. The author is trying to balance his personal time with his girlfriend's need for attention. The fact that this turned into an argument multiple times suggests that both parties aren't fully meeting each other's needs. The author might be in the right because everyone needs some personal time, but he could also be at fault if he's not considering her feelings of neglect. His girlfriend's request for preplanning might be reasonable to help her feel included and not left out when he's gaming. However, the author's response that she doesn't need to go out every time is also valid because she should be able to relax without pressure. \n\nBut the issue is that the author's approach might not be acknowledging her emotional needs. Just telling her to relax on her phone might not be enough if she's seeking more active involvement or feels left out. The author could be wrong in not being more proactive in finding a solution that makes both of them comfortable. Maybe suggesting alternatives like setting specific gaming times where she knows in advance, or incorporating her into the activity in a way she enjoys, could help. \n\nAlternatively, the author is not wrong because he's entitled to his own hobbies and relaxation time. The problem might be more about the girlfriend's expectations and how they're communicated. However, since the conflict is recurring and causing arguments, it's a sign that both need to adjust. \n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area, but I think the author isn't entirely wrong because he's trying to maintain his personal interests. However, he could be more considerate of her feelings. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), because it's not entirely his fault, but there's room for improvement in communication and compromise.\n"
