We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live together, have been dating three years. The author used to spend time gaming alone when they weren't living together. Now that they're together, when he wants to play games, his girlfriend is upset because she feels she has nothing to do and expects him to plan so she can make her own plans. The author argues that it's not a \"plan\" and tells her to relax, use her phone, etc. She goes to her sister's house and they argue multiple times.\n\nSo, the main issue is about expectations in a relationship regarding personal time. The girlfriend wants the author to coordinate his gaming time so she can have activities, while the author wants the freedom to game without having to plan around her. \n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether he's being inconsiderate by not adjusting his gaming to her needs. The girlfriend's perspective is that she feels neglected when he plays games without her. The author feels he's entitled to his personal time. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to communicate that he's not going anywhere and they can talk while he plays, but she wasn't satisfied. He then told her she doesn't need to make plans, which she took as dismissive. \n\nIs it fair for the girlfriend to expect pre-planning? Maybe she feels that if he's going to be occupied, she should have her own time. However, the author might feel that his gaming is a personal activity where he doesn't need to involve her. \n\nBut when you live together, shared space can lead to conflicts. If the Xbox is in a common area, maybe she expects him to consider her presence. Or maybe he's using their shared living space for personal activity without considering her. \n\nThe author's response of telling her to relax or use her phone might be seen as not acknowledging her feelings. Even if she's being clingy, the way he dismissed her could be hurtful. \n\nHowever, the author is also entitled to personal time. The problem might stem from not finding a middle ground. The girlfriend's reaction of leaving to her sister's house could indicate she's unhappy and using that as a way to cope. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author is respecting her needs without compromising his own. Since he's living with her and using shared space, maybe he should consider her feelings more. But he's also not wrong for wanting personal time. \n\nIn many cases, expecting your partner to plan around your activities can be too much, but if it's causing repeated conflict, both need to communicate better. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for compromise. However, based on the situation described, maybe the author is not in the wrong because he's asserting his need for personal time, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's expectation might be unrealistic, expecting him to coordinate gaming sessions so she can go out. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I should check if there's a point where he's being dismissive. Saying \"she doesn't need to go out just because I want to play games\" is valid, but telling her to relax on her phone is okay. So overall, B.\n"
