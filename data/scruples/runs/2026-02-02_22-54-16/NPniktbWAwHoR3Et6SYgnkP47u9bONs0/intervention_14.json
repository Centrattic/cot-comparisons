We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author lives with his girlfriend and they've been together for three years. Initially, he gave up his free time for dates and couple activities. Now that they live together, he wants to game with his friends, but she's upset because she feels left out. She wants him to plan ahead so she can have her own activities. He argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he plays and that she can just relax or use her phone. She goes to her sister's house when this happens, leading to arguments.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author is trying to balance his personal time with his partner's needs. He's not wrong in wanting to maintain his hobbies, especially since gaming is a social activity for him. However, his girlfriend feels neglected when he plays games without her. She's suggesting a structured plan to manage their time together and apart. \n\nThe author's response of telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time seems valid because it's unrealistic to expect someone to have plans for every moment the other person is occupied. His suggestion for her to relax or use her phone is also reasonable, as people often have downtime. However, the issue might be that the author didn't consider her emotional needs. She might feel that when he's gaming, he's not engaging with her, and she's seeking more interaction. \n\nBut the problem arises when she starts to go to her sister's house, which could be a way to distance herself out of frustration. The author's reaction of telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time might be seen as dismissive, not necessarily wrong. It's about mutual respect and understanding. The author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his need for personal time, which is important in a relationship. However, there's room for both to adjust\u2014maybe finding a middle ground where they can have some alone time and shared time without conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. It's a matter of balancing individual needs, and both could improve communication, but the author's stance isn't unjustified.\n"
