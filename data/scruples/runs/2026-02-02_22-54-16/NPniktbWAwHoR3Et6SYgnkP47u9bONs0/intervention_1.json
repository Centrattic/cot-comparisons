We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together for three years and live together now. The author used to game alone when they were in separate houses, but now living together, the girlfriend feels she needs to have plans when he's gaming, because she's bored or has nothing to do. The author thinks she's overreacting and that she can just relax or use his laptop.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. The author mentions that the girlfriend wants constant attention, which he's okay with, but he also wants to play games with friends. The girlfriend is upset because she feels she has to make plans when he's gaming. The author tried to explain that she doesn't need to go out every time, just relax. But she's still upset, leading to arguments.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, maybe both sides need to compromise. However, the author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's expectation that she must have plans when he's gaming might be unreasonable. The author is allowing her to watch or use the laptop, which shows he's making an effort. The problem is the girlfriend's reaction and the assumption that plans are necessary. \n\nSo, the author's stance is about setting personal boundaries and not making gaming a scheduled event that requires her to have alternative plans. Since the girlfriend's reaction stems from a need for attention and the author is trying to balance both their needs, it's more about the girlfriend's expectations than the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
