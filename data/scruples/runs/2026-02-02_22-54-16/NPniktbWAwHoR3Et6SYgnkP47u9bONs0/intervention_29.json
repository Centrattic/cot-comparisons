We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who wants the author to preplan his gaming time so she can make her own plans, but the author thinks she doesn't need to go out every time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that they live together and have been together for three years. He gave up gaming for a while before resuming, and now his girlfriend is upset because she feels left out when he plays. She wants to have her own plans when he's gaming. The author argues that she doesn't have to do anything and can just relax, but she's upset about it.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend might feel neglected if her partner is gaming without considering her. On the other hand, the author wants to maintain his gaming time, which is important to him. The argument arises from differing expectations of how their time together should be structured. \n\nThe author says he's fine with her wanting constant attention but also wants to game. However, by not preplanning, he's not meeting her expectation of coordination. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might indicate she's seeking space or feels ignored. The author's response, telling her she doesn't need to make plans, might dismiss her feelings of wanting to have her own time.\n\nIn relationships, balance is crucial. Both partners need to feel heard and respected. The author's insistence that she doesn't have to make plans might not address her underlying need for shared or solo activities that don't involve her being alone while he's occupied. The fact that she's bringing this up multiple times suggests it's a recurring issue that needs resolution through mutual understanding.\n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely wrong for wanting to game, he might be in the wrong for not adequately addressing his girlfriend's emotional needs. The problem isn't just about gaming time but about how their time together is managed. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not fully considering her perspective and the impact of his actions on her feelings. However, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. But given the repeated arguments and her reactions, the author's approach might be contributing to the issue.\n"
