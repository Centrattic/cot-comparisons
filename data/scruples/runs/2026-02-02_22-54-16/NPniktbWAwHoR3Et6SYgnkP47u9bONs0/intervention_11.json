We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. The situation is that they live together, and the girlfriend is upset when he plays games without planning ahead so she can go out. The author argues that she doesn't have to do anything specific just because he's gaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend seems to feel that when he plays games, she's left without things to do, so she wants to make plans in advance. The author, on the other hand, feels that it's okay for her to relax or use her phone instead of going out. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author did give notice before playing, but the girlfriend might feel that her needs aren't being considered. The fact that she went to her sister's house for hours each time suggests she's not happy with the situation. The author's response of telling her she can just relax or use her phone might come off as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nHowever, the author also mentions that he wants to spend time with her and that he's generally fine with her wanting attention. The conflict arises when his gaming time interferes with her need for activities. It's possible that the author isn't wrong in wanting to game, but maybe he could have approached the situation differently. For example, discussing a compromise where he games less frequently or finds other ways to engage her while he's playing.\n\nBut according to the details, the author is standing his ground, explaining that gaming isn't a plan and that she doesn't have to do anything. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be about her feeling neglected when he's engrossed in games. The author's initial reaction might not be wrong, but maybe he didn't fully address her underlying needs. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, it's a balance between his right to game and her need for attention. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to accommodate each other's needs. The author isn't inherently wrong for wanting his own time, but maybe he didn't handle the communication well. However, the question is whether he's at fault. Since he's trying to balance both needs and isn't forcing her to leave the house, but just clarifying that she doesn't have to make plans, I think the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's stance is also reasonable. The main issue is communication. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they address each other's needs.\n"
