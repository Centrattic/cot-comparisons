We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy and his girlfriend living together, and he's playing video games, which she's not happy about unless he plans it in advance so she can make her own plans. The author thinks he's not wrong, but I need to analyze both sides.\n\nFirst, the guy has been gaming after work, which he used to do when they were apart. Now that they live together, she wants him to plan his gaming time so she can go out or do something else. He argues that she doesn't have to go out every time; she can just relax. But she's feeling neglected because when he's gaming, she's stuck with nothing to do and wants her own time. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When they first started dating, he gave up some free time for dates, but now she's adjusting to living together. Maybe she needs her own space, and his gaming time without planning gives her a sense of being left out. The guy is trying to balance his own interests (gaming with friends) with her need for attention. \n\nHe did try to explain that she could watch him play or do her own thing, but she felt it wasn't enough. The argument is recurring because she's not getting the validation she wants. He's not wrong for wanting to game, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. However, he did mention trying to compromise by giving her advanced notice and suggesting she use her phone or laptop. \n\nOn the other hand, she might be expecting too much. Maybe she's not communicated her needs clearly, but he's also not entirely wrong. It's a balance. If they can't find a middle ground, it's a problem. But in this case, the author is defending his right to game without her having to make plans each time. He's not forcing her to interact; he's just being with his friends. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether his actions are respecting her needs. He's not wrong because he's not forcing her to do anything. But maybe he could have been more considerate. However, since he's trying to find a balance, and she's being rigid about making plans, the fault isn't entirely his. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
