We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nThe situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. He plays games with friends, and she's upset because she feels she has to make plans every time he wants to game. She wants to go out when he's busy, but he thinks she doesn't need to do that and can just relax. He argues that she wants constant attention, but he also wants time to game. \n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author initially tried to let her know he was going to play, but she wasn't happy. She felt neglected, so she left to her sister's house. Then the author told her she didn't need to make plans, just relax. But she kept expecting him to plan so she could go out. \n\nThe problem here might be differing expectations. The author might not realize that his girlfriend is seeking attention and feels that when he's occupied, she's left with nothing. By saying she doesn't need to make plans, he's dismissing her need for social time. However, it's also valid for the author to want some downtime with friends. \n\nHe mentioned she's the type who wants constant attention, which could be a pattern. But if he's living with her, balancing both their needs is important. Maybe he's not wrong in wanting to game, but perhaps he didn't address her feelings of loneliness properly. He tried to make a joke about her watching him play, which might not have been considerate. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is necessary. The author's stance is that she doesn't need to go out every time, but she might need some independence. He's not in the wrong if he's being honest about his needs, but maybe he's not considering hers enough. However, since he's the one asking for validation, the answer depends on whether his actions crossed a line. \n\nHe did try to communicate, but she left, which indicates deeper issues. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his right to have personal time, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best solution. Since both have valid needs, it's a matter of balance. The author's response might be seen as dismissive, but he's also not entirely wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B. He's not in the wrong for wanting to game and telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time. However, he could be more considerate. But according to the given options, A is yes, B is no. The key is whether he violated any boundaries. If she felt neglected and he's aware but insists she doesn't need to go out, maybe he's not wrong because he's expressing his needs. But the situation is nuanced. The answer might be B.\n"
