We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend and girlfriend living together. The boyfriend wants to play games with his friends, and the girlfriend is upset that he doesn't plan it out so she can have something to do. The author (the boyfriend) is arguing that she doesn't need to make plans every time he plays games, and they can just have time together after he's done.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The boyfriend has a history of giving up his free time for their relationship. Now that they're living together, he wants to maintain some gaming time with friends. The girlfriend is feeling neglected because when he's gaming, she's left alone. She wants him to plan ahead so she can do something else during that time. The author told her she doesn't have to go out and can just relax, but she's upset because he's not considering her feelings of loneliness.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect in the relationship. The girlfriend is expressing a need for attention and companionship. The boyfriend, on the other hand, wants to retain some personal time. The question is whether the boyfriend is wrong for not accommodating her request to plan in advance.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal interests with the partner's needs. The boyfriend's gaming is a personal activity, but since they live together, it's part of their shared life. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling left out, not just about making plans. The author's response of saying she can relax on her phone or use the laptop might not be sufficient if she feels she's not getting enough quality time with him. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend also mentions that he's willing to spend one-on-one time with her after gaming. The issue might be that the girlfriend wants that time during the day rather than after. If the boyfriend is consistent in his gaming schedule, maybe planning ahead would help both of them manage their time better. The author's refusal to require planning might be seen as dismissing her feelings of being left out.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be expecting more from the relationship. The boyfriend has been giving up his time in the past, so maybe the adjustment now is that he wants some personal time. The girlfriend's insistence on making plans every time might be unreasonable if it's causing stress. It's a balance between personal space and togetherness.\n\nI think the main issue is communication. The boyfriend could be more considerate of her feelings by suggesting alternatives, like shorter gaming sessions or finding activities they can do together. The girlfriend might need to express her needs more clearly and be open to compromise. The author isn't necessarily wrong, but there's room for both sides to adjust. However, the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her to go out and he's offering time together, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if his actions are making her feel neglected, then he might have some responsibility to address her feelings. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to maintain his interests and has suggested time together, but there's a nuance here. The final answer would be B, but with the understanding that both need to communicate better.\n"
