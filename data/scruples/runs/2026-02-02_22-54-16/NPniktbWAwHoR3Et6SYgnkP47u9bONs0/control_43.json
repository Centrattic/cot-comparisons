We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living together where the guy wants to play games with his friends, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels left out.\n\nFirst, the guy says he used to spend a lot of time on dates when they first started dating but now that they live together, he wants to game. The girlfriend is asking him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans when he's gaming. He argues that she doesn't need to go out every time and that she can just relax or use his laptop. The girlfriend is going to her sister's house when he plays, which seems like she's trying to have space but feels like he's not considering her needs.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The boyfriend is expressing his need for personal time, which is understandable. However, the girlfriend is feeling neglected and wants to have her own activities when he's occupied. The problem might be that he's not considering her feelings when he just plays without planning ahead, even if he's not doing anything wrong. On the flip side, the girlfriend might be overreacting by making a big deal out of him wanting to game, especially since he's open to her being there or using his stuff. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house multiple times suggests she's seeking space or validation, which isn't necessarily his fault. The author's response that she doesn't need to go out every time is valid because he's not doing anything that requires her to make plans. However, the fact that the argument keeps happening implies that there's a communication breakdown. The author might not be in the wrong because he's trying to balance his own needs with the relationship, but maybe he could be more considerate. However, the girlfriend's expectation that she needs to make plans when he plays might be unreasonable. \n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about both sides needing to adjust. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong specifically. Since the author is clearly stating his needs and the girlfriend is the one creating conflict by her reactions, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B, but I need to check if there's any fault on his part. He did tell her he's playing, which is good, and offered her to watch or talk. The girlfriend's issue is more about her own expectations not being met. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
