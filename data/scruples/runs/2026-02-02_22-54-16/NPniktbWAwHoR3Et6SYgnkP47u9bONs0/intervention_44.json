We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to play video games, and their girlfriend being upset because she feels left out and wants to make plans when he's gaming.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. They live together, they've been together three years. The author used to give up free time for dates before, but now they live together. The girlfriend wants him to preplan his gaming so she can make her own plans. The author argues she doesn't need to leave every time.\n\nThe author says he's fine with her wanting attention but also wants to game with friends. The girlfriend's reaction is that she has nothing to do while he's gaming. The author offered her to watch, talk, etc., but she went to her sister's house. Then she's upset when he plays without her making plans. The author told her she doesn't have to leave; she can just relax. \n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, is the author wrong? Well, he's expressing his need to have personal time. The girlfriend's expectations might be different. But is it unreasonable for him to play games without her needing to be involved? The author is trying to balance his personal time and their relationship. \n\nHe's not making demands, just stating that she doesn't need to plan something just because he's gaming. The girlfriend might feel neglected, but the author is also asserting his right to personal time. Since they live together, maybe the girlfriend expects more shared time. But the author isn't excluding her from his life; he's just using his own time as he wants. \n\nThe answer might be B (No) because he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's expectations could be unrealistic, and the author is trying to communicate that he doesn't need her to plan activities just because he's gaming. It's about mutual respect of each other's needs. However, maybe the author could have been more communicative, but based on the description, he tried to explain and compromise. So the author isn't wrong.\n"
