We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the guy and his girlfriend live together. He's been gaming a lot, and lately, when he wants to play with friends, his girlfriend is upset because she feels left out. She wants him to make plans when he plays so she can do something else. He told her she doesn't need to go out every time, just chill on her phone or use the laptop. They argue about this multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy wants his own time to game with friends, which is a legitimate need. Gaming is a common hobby, and it's understandable that he wants to do that. However, his girlfriend is feeling neglected because when he games, she has nothing to do. She might feel that their time together is the only time they interact, so when he's gaming, she's alone. But now that they live together, maybe expectations have changed.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction: she went to her sister's house when he was gaming. That might indicate she's seeking space or is upset. But he's trying to explain that gaming isn't a \"plan\" but just a casual activity. He's also offered that they can spend time together after he's done. The problem seems to be communication. She wants advance notice so she can plan her own time, but he feels she's making a big deal out of it.\n\nThe guy's point is that he's allowed to have his own hobbies and that she doesn't have to do something else every time he plays. It's a balance between personal space and couple time. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have their own time. But when they live together, maybe the girlfriend feels that when he's gaming, she's left with nothing. However, he's offering her alternatives like using the laptop or phone, which might not be satisfying for her if she wants more social interaction.\n\nIs the guy in the wrong? Well, he's asserting his right to have personal time, which is valid. But maybe he's not considering her feelings enough. When they first started dating, he gave up his time for dates, but now that they live together, maybe the expectations have shifted. The issue is that she's feeling neglected, and he's not addressing her emotional needs. But he's also not wrong to want his own time. The key is whether he's being dismissive of her feelings. By telling her not to go out every time, he's not respecting her need for engagement. Maybe a middle ground is needed, like setting specific game times and other times for togetherness. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since both have valid points, but the girlfriend's feelings are important, maybe the guy is partially at fault for not finding a compromise. But since he's defending his right to personal time, it's not entirely his fault. The answer might be B (No), because he's justified in wanting his own time, but the situation requires better communication. Alternatively, A (Yes) if his actions are disregarding her feelings. Hmm. It's a bit of a grey area, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to balance both needs, but the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling left out, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
