We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together for three years and live together now. The author used to game separately when they lived apart, and now that they're together, the girlfriend expects him to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans. She gets upset when he just wants to play without a prior arrangement.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't see it as a plan when he told her he was going to play, but the girlfriend felt that if he wants time for games, she should have time to do something else. The author argues that she doesn't need to leave the house every time; she can just relax or use her phone. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to balance his own need for downtime with his girlfriend's expectations. He's making an effort to let her know in advance, but when she doesn't follow through, she blames him. The girlfriend might be feeling neglected, especially since she mentions missing him. The author is okay with giving her attention but also wants his gaming time with friends.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, it's important that both partners feel heard and respected. The author might be in the right because he's not forcing her to leave; he's suggesting she can have her own time at home. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too; she might feel that her needs aren't being considered. The problem could stem from differing expectations about how to spend time together and alone.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The core issue is about mutual respect and compromise. If the author isn't making her leave the house and is open to talking, he's meeting her halfway. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations, but the author's stance seems reasonable. So, likely the answer is B (No).\n"
