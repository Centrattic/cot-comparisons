We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time they want to game. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, been dating three years. The guy wants to play games with friends, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels left out and has nothing to do. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, suggesting she can relax or use his laptop. The girlfriend wants pre-planning so she can have her own plans during his gaming time.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The girlfriend might feel neglected because when they lived apart, he could game alone, but now that they're together, her free time is tied to his. She's asking for space when he's gaming, but in her own way. The author, on the other hand, is trying to balance his need for social gaming with his relationship. \n\nThe key points: Communication is a big issue here. The author thought telling her he was going to game was enough, but she wanted more structured plans. The author's response was to say she doesn't have to make plans, just relax or use his laptop. Maybe he didn't consider that she might need more than that\u2014perhaps she wants her own time or activities that require planning ahead.\n\nBut is he wrong? Well, everyone has different needs. The author isn't doing anything inherently wrong by wanting to game. However, the girlfriend's feelings of being excluded are valid. The author's solution (\u8ba9\u5979 relax or use the laptop) might not address her need for her own space or activities. Maybe he should have been more proactive in finding a middle ground, like setting specific gaming times that don't interfere with their couple time, or planning activities together when he's not gaming. \n\nThe answer hinges on mutual respect and communication. The author isn't entirely wrong, but he could be more considerate. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B (No) because he's expressing his needs, but there's room for improvement. However, some might argue he's dismissive of her feelings. But the prompt says to answer A if yes, B if no. Given the context, B seems more likely because both have valid perspectives, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asserting his right to game. He could, however, work on better communication.\n"
