We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend expecting the author to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans, and the author saying she doesn't need to go out every time. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple has been together for three years and now lives together. The author used to give up free time for dates and couple activities, but now he wants to game with his friends. The girlfriend is upset because she feels neglected when he plays games. The author argues that she doesn't have to make plans each time he games and can just relax on her phone or use his laptop. The girlfriend is insistent that he needs to plan ahead so she can do something, but if she doesn't, she blames him.\n\nSo, the main issue is about expectations and communication. The girlfriend feels that when they live together, the author should coordinate his gaming time so she can have her own time. The author thinks that since he's not leaving the house, she can just do her own thing. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, living together means more shared time, so maybe the expectation is higher for both to engage with each other. The author is using his free time to game, which was a hobby he gave up before. The girlfriend might feel that after moving in together, her personal time is being affected. However, the author is trying to balance both his need for downtime and their relationship. \n\nBut the problem seems to be that the girlfriend is expecting planning for every gaming session, which might not be feasible. The author is suggesting that she can just do her own thing when he's gaming. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house and then blaming him if she didn't make plans could be the issue here. She might be trying to assert her need for personal space, but the way she's doing it leads to arguments. \n\nThe author's point is that he's not making a \"plan\" by gaming at home, so she doesn't need to plan around it. But the girlfriend might see it as him not considering her needs, even if it's just time for her to do something else. The question is whether the author is wrong for not accommodating her request to plan ahead. \n\nIn relationships, especially when living together, both partners need to find a balance. If the author is gaming a lot and it's making the girlfriend feel left out, maybe he should be more considerate. However, the girlfriend's approach of making him preplan and then getting upset if she isn't prepared could be unreasonable. \n\nThe author isn't being inconsiderate by suggesting she can use her phone or the laptop. The girlfriend's need for constant attention might be valid, but expecting him to plan every gaming session so she can go out each time might be too much. It's a communication problem. The author should probably talk to her about how they can both have time to themselves without it causing conflict, but he isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to preplan every gaming session. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance here. They both need to communicate better. The author isn't wrong for wanting to game, but he might need to adjust how he approaches it. However, based on the given information, the immediate question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend is setting a condition that he preplans, and the author is pushing back, it's more about differing needs. The author isn't wrong if he's being fair and open to finding a middle ground. The girlfriend's demand for preplanning and then blaming him if she doesn't manage it might be the issue. So, the answer is B.\n"
