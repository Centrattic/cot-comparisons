We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together, and he wants to game sometimes. The girlfriend is upset because he just tells her he's going to play games without making plans for her to do something else. The author says he doesn't think she needs to make plans every time he wants to game, while she feels it's not fair and wants him to plan ahead so she can have her own time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that they've been together for 3 years and he's made sacrifices before, like giving up free time for dates. Now that they live together, he's trying to balance his gaming with their time. He thought she was joking when she said she wanted plans, but she was serious. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be that when he plays games, she feels left out and has nothing to do. She wants to have her own activities when he's gaming, which makes sense because cohabitation can mean you need to balance personal time and shared time.\n\nThe author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to go out, just chill on her phone or use the laptop. But maybe he didn't consider that she might not want to just be on her phone while he's gaming; perhaps she values having some independent time or feels neglected if she's just passively around. The girlfriend might feel like her needs for attention and companionship are being overlooked. The author's approach of expecting her to just be on her phone might not address her emotional needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also trying to maintain his own hobbies and social connections through gaming with friends. It's reasonable for him to want to keep that part of his life, especially since they both are used to having their own activities before living together. The key issue here is communication and mutual understanding. The author might not have realized how his actions were affecting her emotionally. By not planning ahead, he might be making her feel like her time and needs aren't considered. \n\nIn relationships, especially when living together, it's important to find a balance between personal space and shared time. The girlfriend's request to plan ahead so she can have her own plans isn't unreasonable. The author's response to dismiss her need for plans and tell her to just use her phone or the laptop might come off as dismissive of her feelings. He should have had a more open conversation about how they both can balance their activities without making the other feel neglected. \n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely wrong for wanting to game and maintain his friendships, he might be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not finding a compromise. The girlfriend's need for attention and structured time is valid, and the author should have addressed it more thoughtfully instead of minimizing her concerns. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't adequately consider his girlfriend's perspective and needs, leading to her feeling neglected.\n"
