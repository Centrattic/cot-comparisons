We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting to make plans whenever he wants to play games, and the author is telling her she doesn't need to do that. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been together three years and lives together now. The author mentions that when they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates, but now he wants to game. The girlfriend is upset that when he plays games, she's left with nothing to do. She wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. The author argues that it's not a plan, just him chilling, and he told her she can watch or use his laptop. She went to her sister's house, and they had arguments about it.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual expectations. The author feels that gaming is his downtime, and he's being accommodating by trying to let her know in advance. The girlfriend feels neglected and wants to have her own time when he's occupied. The author's response is that she doesn't need to go out, just relax. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but they're asking for my opinion. \n\nI should consider if the author is respecting his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend is expressing that she feels left out. The author is trying to balance his gaming time with her need for attention. But maybe the author isn't considering that even if it's not a formal plan, gaming is a social activity he's doing with friends, and she might not want to be alone. \n\nThe author's argument is that she can watch or use the laptop, but maybe that's not satisfying for her. If she's used to having his attention, living together might mean she expects more shared time. The author's response of \"just relax on your phone\" might not be enough. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is trying to maintain some personal space and hobbies. It's a balance. The girlfriend's request for pre-planning might be reasonable if she's trying to manage her own time. However, the author is pushing back because he doesn't want her to feel obligated to make plans every time. \n\nThe problem here is communication. The author might not be fully acknowledging her feelings of neglect. Even if the gaming isn't a formal \"plan,\" it's a time when he's engaging with others, and she's left alone. The author's suggestion that she can just watch or use the laptop might not address her deeper need for companionship or her own activities. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house could be a cry for more attention or a way to cope with feeling left out. The author's response to the situation, telling her she doesn't need to make plans, could be dismissive of her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a middle ground. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to have personal time, but he might not be considering enough how his actions affect his girlfriend. The key is whether he's being inconsiderate by not adjusting his behavior to accommodate her needs. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. However, if the girlfriend is expressing that she feels neglected and the author is not making an effort to include her or find a compromise, he might be at fault. But if he's trying to communicate that he's still present and available for her, maybe he's not. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because he's trying to explain his position and is allowing her to use the laptop or watch. However, he might not be addressing the root of her feelings. The answer hinges on whether his actions are respectful of her emotional needs. Since the question is binary (A for yes, B for no), and the user's initial thought is B, I might lean towards B. But I need to make sure. \n\nConsidering that the author is trying to balance his own needs with his girlfriend's, but perhaps not fully addressing her emotional response, the answer could go either way. However, in the context of the AITA format, usually, the person is considered at fault if they're disregarding the other's feelings. But sometimes, if both have valid points, the answer is nuanced. Given the options here, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but I need to be cautious. \n\nThe key is whether the author is respecting his girlfriend's feelings of needing attention. If he's not making an effort to include her or find a solution that meets both their needs, he might be at fault. But if he's communicating that he's available after gaming, maybe not. The girlfriend's reaction (going to her sister's) and the arguments suggest that the author's approach isn't working. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a valid point about wanting personal time, he might not be adequately addressing his girlfriend's emotional needs. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since both have valid perspectives, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the answer might be A or B. But given the scenario, the author is likely not in the wrong (B) because he's trying to explain his position and is allowing her flexibility, but he could be more considerate. However, in AITA terms, sometimes the person is considered at fault for not considering the other's feelings enough. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the answer is B.\n"
