We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who gets upset when he plays video games, even though they live together and he's not going out. The author's main point is that he wants to game with his friends online and doesn't think his girlfriend needs to make plans every time he does that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend is upset because when he plays games, she feels like she has to make plans or else she's bored. She mentions missing him and possibly feeling left out. The author, on the other hand, feels that since he's at home and just playing, she can watch or use her phone. But the girlfriend keeps expecting him to preplan so she can make her own plans, and if she doesn't, she blames him. \n\nThe key here is about expectations and communication. When they started living together, there's a shift in how they spend their time. The author used to play games when they were apart, but now that they live together, she wants more quality time. It's possible that she's trying to adjust to being in a shared living space and the challenges of maintaining a relationship without having separate schedules. \n\nThe author's response was to say she doesn't need to plan anything because he's not leaving the house. That makes sense because if he's just playing at home, she can still be present, maybe just not actively participating. But the girlfriend's perspective is that she feels neglected when he's engaged in something else. She might be looking for more mutual engagement rather than him being in his own world. \n\nI should consider if the author is being dismissive of her feelings. When he says she can watch him play or use her phone, it might come off as him not valuing her need for companionship. Even if he's not physically leaving, the act of playing games could be seen as mentally or emotionally distancing. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that she blames him when she fails to make plans. This suggests that there's some expectation from her side that he should coordinate his gaming times so she can plan to be busy. Maybe she's trying to establish a balance where they both have their own activities but also time together. \n\nBut then again, the author is trying to maintain his personal time. The question is whether his gaming time is encroaching on their shared time. If they live together, the girlfriend might feel that his free time is also shared time, especially if they were used to being together when they were in separate houses. \n\nI think the problem here is more about communication and differing expectations. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting his own time, but he could be not considering her feelings enough. The girlfriend's need for attention is a valid concern, and the author might need to find a middle ground, like setting specific times for gaming where she can choose to be involved or not. \n\nIn the end, the answer depends on whether the author is respecting her feelings. If he's being dismissive or not making an effort to include her, then maybe he's not wrong in wanting his own time, but he could be right in not addressing her emotional needs properly. The girlfriend's reaction might be a bit over the top, but her feelings of being neglected are real. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Based on the scenario, the author's actions are understandable but perhaps not the most considerate. However, since he's not forcing her to do anything and is offering alternatives, maybe B is the right choice. The main issue is mutual understanding and compromise, not outright wrongdoing.\n"
