We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting to make plans whenever he wants to game, and the author telling her she doesn't have to. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together three years, living together for four months. The author used to spend a lot of time with his girlfriend, but now they live together, he wants to game with his friends. His girlfriend is upset because she feels ignored, wanting to make plans when he's gaming. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out each time, just relax or use his laptop.\n\nThe girlfriend's main issue is that when he's gaming, she has nothing to do and feels neglected. The author thinks it's not a big deal and that she can just relax or use her phone. The author's response is that she doesn't need to make plans, which led to arguments. The girlfriend wanted to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel that when they're together, his gaming time is taking away from their time. She might want to spend time doing her own things, but if she's at home, she might not have anything else to do. The author is trying to maintain his hobbies and social life with friends, which is important for his well-being.\n\nBut communication seems to be an issue. The author might not be considering her feelings of loneliness when he's gaming. Even if he's not going anywhere, she might feel that their time together is being replaced by his game time. The author's response of telling her to just relax or use her phone might not address her need for engagement or her own activities.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to balance his own needs. It's reasonable for him to want personal time, especially with friends. The girlfriend's expectation to always make plans when he's gaming might be a bit high. Maybe she's not used to living together and adjusting to shared living space versus their previous dynamic of being together but in separate homes.\n\nThe key here is mutual understanding and compromise. The author might not be in the wrong because he's asserting his right to have personal time, but he might also need to address her feelings of neglect. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not accommodating her plans. If she's feeling unappreciated or lonely, the author should consider her perspective more. But given the way the situation is presented, the author is trying to communicate that she doesn't have to plan something every time, which is reasonable. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
