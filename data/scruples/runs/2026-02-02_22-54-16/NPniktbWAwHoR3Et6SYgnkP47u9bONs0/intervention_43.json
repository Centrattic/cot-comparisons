We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They've been together three years and live together now. The key points are:\n\nThe girlfriend wants him to pre-plan gaming time so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he's gaming. He mentions she's the type that wants constant attention but he also wants to play with friends. \n\nThe girlfriend's main issue seems to be feeling neglected when he's gaming. She wants to have her own activities during that time, maybe to not be alone. The author is pushing back, saying she can just relax or use his laptop. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both have valid needs. The author has a right to his downtime, but the girlfriend feels she's not getting enough attention. The problem is communication. The author didn't anticipate her reaction when he started gaming again after a break. He tried to explain it's not a plan, but she took it as him being busy and not available. \n\nThe author's response of telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time might come off as dismissive. Maybe he should have found a middle ground, like setting specific game times or checking in with her to see how she feels. However, the core issue is mutual: the girlfriend's need for attention versus his need for personal time. \n\nSince the author is trying to balance both needs and is communicating his desire to still spend time with her after gaming, he's not entirely at fault. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations or communicate her needs more effectively. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his need for personal time, which is reasonable. However, there's room for improvement in their communication.\n"
