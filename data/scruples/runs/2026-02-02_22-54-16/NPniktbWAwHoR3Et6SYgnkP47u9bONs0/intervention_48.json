We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. He likes to play video games, especially when his friends ask him to join. The girlfriend is upset because when he's gaming, she feels left out and wants to make plans so she doesn't have to be alone. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays and that she can just relax or use his laptop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been in a relationship for three years and has given up a lot of his time before for dates. Now that they live together, he's trying to maintain some of his hobbies. It's reasonable for him to want some personal time. However, the girlfriend is feeling neglected. She wants to spend time with him and is upset when he's engaged in games. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author initially tried to explain that gaming isn't a formal plan, but she wanted him to pre-plan so she could make her own plans. He tried to accommodate by giving advanced notice, but she still felt blamed if she didn't make plans. He then told her she doesn't need to go out and can just relax. \n\nThe girlfriend's need for attention is valid, and it's important in a relationship to balance personal time with partner time. However, the author is also entitled to his hobbies. The problem might be more about how they communicate their needs. The author's response of saying she doesn't need to go out every time could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Maybe he should have discussed finding a middle ground instead of just stating his position. \n\nBut on the other hand, expecting her to make plans every time he wants to game might be unrealistic. It's possible that she's using his gaming as a way to express that she feels lonely or wants more quality time together. The author might need to address her underlying feelings rather than just the surface issue of making plans. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a two-way street. The author isn't entirely wrong for wanting to game, but maybe he didn't fully consider her emotional needs. However, the girlfriend's reaction could be overreacting by going to her sister's house multiple times. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's standing up for his personal time, but there's room for better communication. The answer would probably be B, but I'm a bit unsure if I missed something.\n"
