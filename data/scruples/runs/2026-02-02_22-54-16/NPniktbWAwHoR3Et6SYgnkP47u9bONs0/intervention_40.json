We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They live together, have been for four months. The problem started when he mentioned playing Apex Legends, and she got upset because she felt she had nothing to do. He thought it was funny to suggest she watch him play, but she wanted him to plan ahead so she could have her own plans. He argues that she doesn't need to go out every time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend might feel neglected if he's playing games without considering her. When you live together, you're spending a lot of time together, so she might expect more quality time. The author, on the other hand, is maintaining his own hobby and social activities, which is important for his well-being. The key issue is communication and mutual understanding.\n\nThe author says he's fine with her wanting attention but also wants his gaming time. However, he didn't plan ahead, which led to her feeling left out. When he told her to just relax or use her phone, that might not have been enough for her. She might need more active inclusion or different plans.\n\nBut then, the author is not forcing her to go out; he's saying she doesn't need to make plans. It's about balancing personal time and couple time. The problem arises when her needs aren't being met. However, the author is trying to maintain his own interests. It's a common conflict in relationships.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. But there's a need for better communication. He could have explained his needs more and maybe found a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not being malicious and is expressing his needs, but perhaps not fully understanding hers, the answer might be B (No), but with the caveat that both need to adjust. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be a bit extreme, expecting her to make plans every time he games. So maybe B is correct.\n"
