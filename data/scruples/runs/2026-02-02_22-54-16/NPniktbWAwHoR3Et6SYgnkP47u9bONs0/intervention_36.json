We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, been dating for 3 years. The author used to game alone before, but now that they live together, the girlfriend is upset when he plays games without making plans for her. The author thinks she's being unreasonable because he just wants to game with friends, and he told her he's playing, but she expects her to make plans every time. The author argues she doesn't need to go out every time, just relax or use the laptop or phone. The girlfriend feels neglected and misses him when he's gaming, even if he's present.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to plan something every time he wants to game. The girlfriend is upset because she feels she has nothing to do and misses him. The author is defending his right to game, which he's giving up some time for. But the girlfriend feels like she's being left out.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is being honest about his needs, which is important in a relationship. He's not hiding his gaming; he's even offering her options like watching him, using his laptop, or relaxing. However, the girlfriend's feelings about missing him and wanting more one-on-one time are valid too. The problem arises when the author's gaming time becomes a source of conflict because she's not getting the attention she wants.\n\nBut the author isn't forcing her to do anything. He's saying she doesn't need to make plans, which could be seen as reasonable. If she wants time with him, maybe she needs to communicate that better. But the author isn't ignoring her; he's allowing her to do her own thing. However, if the girlfriend feels neglected, that's a valid concern. The author might be in the right if he's not making her do something she doesn't want, but maybe he's not considering her emotional needs enough. But according to the post, he's already offered solutions like talking while he plays. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might indicate she's feeling hurt and needs space. The author's response to tell her she doesn't need to go out every time could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Maybe he's not wrong in the sense of not controlling her actions, but he could be more empathetic. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her to do anything and is allowing her to have her own time, maybe he's not in the wrong. The problem might be more about communication and expectations rather than right or wrong. \n\nIn relationships, both partners have needs. The author's need for personal time is valid, but the girlfriend's need for attention is also valid. The author isn't at fault if he's respecting her choices and not making her do anything. However, if his gaming is causing her distress without effort to balance their needs, maybe there's room for compromise. But based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong because he's not controlling her actions and is offering her alternatives. The girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic. So the answer would be B.\n"
