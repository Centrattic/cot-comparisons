We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting to make plans when he plays games, and the author telling her she doesn't need to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for three years and lives together now. The author used to spend time alone gaming when they weren't living together. Now that they're together, the girlfriend expects him to plan his gaming time so she can have her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans just because he's playing games and that she can relax or use her phone/laptop.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she feels neglected when he plays without her. She wants to have her own time when he's gaming, but the author feels like she's overreacting. The author mentions that she went to her sister's house for hours when he was playing, leading to arguments. The author's response was telling her she doesn't need to make plans and that she can just relax.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, communication is key. It seems like both sides have valid needs. The author wants his personal time to game with friends, which is normal. The girlfriend might feel that her time is being taken away, leading to loneliness. The problem arises when their expectations aren't aligned. The author not preplanning might be a point of contention because the girlfriend wants to schedule her time around his gaming. However, the author's argument is that she can just relax instead of making plans.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is wrong for not accommodating his girlfriend's need for plans. From a fairness standpoint, the author isn't wrong in wanting his personal time, but maybe he didn't communicate his needs clearly. However, the girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house multiple times might be an overreaction. The author's response to tell her she doesn't need to make plans is justified if she's overreacting. Still, there's a balance needed. Maybe they need to find a middle ground where both can have their needs met without conflict. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries around his gaming time. The girlfriend's approach of expecting plans every time he plays might be unreasonable. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
