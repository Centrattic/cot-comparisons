We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living together where the guy wants to play games with his friends, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels left out and wants to make plans when he's gaming.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author of the post says that he and his girlfriend live together and have been together for three years. He gave up a lot of his free time for dates when they first started dating. Now, after moving in together, he wants to play Apex Legends with his buddy, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels she has nothing to do during those times. She wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. He responds by telling her she doesn't need to go out, just relax or use his laptop. She ends up going to her sister's house, and this becomes a recurring argument.\n\nFrom the author's point of view, he's trying to balance his own need for downtime with his girlfriend's expectations. He's okay with giving her attention, but he also wants time to game with friends. He feels like she's expecting too much from him when he's trying to have his own time. He's not entirely wrong in wanting to have his own activities, especially since they were together for three years before moving in, where he might have had separate time.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that since they're now living together, she's spending more time with him, and when he's occupied, she's left alone. She might feel that her social needs aren't being met, or that she's not included in his activities. Her reaction of going to her sister's house could be her way of dealing with the loneliness or frustration. She might feel that the gaming interrupts their time together, even if he's still at home.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author mentions that the girlfriend expects him to plan ahead for her to make plans, but she ends up blaming him if she can't follow through. The author tells her she doesn't need to go out, just relax. The question is whether this is fair or not.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to find a balance. The author is asserting his right to personal time, which is valid. However, the girlfriend is also expressing a need for companionship and possibly her own social time. The author's response of \"just relax on your phone\" might not be fulfilling her emotional needs because she might prefer active engagement rather than passive relaxation alone.\n\nBut considering the situation, the author isn't being unreasonable. He's not cutting her out completely; he's just wanting to have his own time. The problem might be more about their communication. The girlfriend's approach of making plans she can't keep might not be effective, and the author's refusal to see her needs as valid could be part of the issue. However, the author is trying to set boundaries, which is important for a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to have personal time. The main issue is their communication and finding a compromise. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No), because he's standing up for his own needs and making it clear that gaming isn't an event requiring her to make plans. However, both sides need to work on understanding each other's needs better.\n"
