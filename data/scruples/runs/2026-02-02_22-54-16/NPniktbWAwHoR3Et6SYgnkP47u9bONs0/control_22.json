We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about the girlfriend wanting to make plans whenever the author wants to game, and the author telling her she doesn't need to. They've been together three years and live together now. The author used to game when they were at separate houses, but now that they live together, the girlfriend feels left out when he plays.\n\nThe author argues that gaming isn't a plan, just relaxing, and that she can watch or use her phone. The girlfriend is upset because she feels ignored and wants more attention. The author is frustrated because he wants to game with friends, which he sees as a normal part of his life.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective: living together means they're together more, so maybe she expects more shared time. The author's perspective: he's entitled to personal time, especially gaming with friends. \n\nThe key points are communication and expectations. The author didn't plan to game as a separate activity from her, but the girlfriend expects mutual planning. The author's solution was to let her use her phone or laptop, which might not be enough for her need for attention.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a relationship standpoint, it's about balancing personal time and partner's needs. The author didn't consider that living together might change the dynamic. He assumes she's okay with being in the same space but not participating. However, the girlfriend feels neglected. \n\nThe author's statement \"she doesn\u2019t need to go out\" might be dismissive of her feelings. Even if she's using her phone, she might want more active engagement. The author could be in the wrong for not addressing her feelings properly, not making an effort to include her, and not finding a middle ground. However, he's also entitled to his own hobbies and time.\n\nBut since the girlfriend is feeling hurt and the author is dismissing her feelings by suggesting she just use her phone, that's a problem. The author should have negotiated a compromise instead of insisting she doesn't need to plan anything. So, the answer might be A (author is wrong) because he's not considering her emotional needs and the change in their living situation.\n"
