We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about gaming time versus the girlfriend's need for plans.\n\nFirst, the couple lives together and has been in a 3-year relationship. The author mentions that when they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his free time, but now that they live together, he wants to game. The girlfriend is upset because when he plays games, she feels she has nothing to do and wants to make plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays; she can just relax or use her phone/laptop.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author is trying to maintain some personal space for gaming, which is a common hobby. The girlfriend feels neglected, expecting quality time. However, the author is clarifying that gaming isn't a scheduled event that requires her to make plans. He's also offering alternatives like her watching him play or using her phone.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's communicating his needs and setting boundaries. It's important in a relationship for both partners to have their own space and interests. The girlfriend's expectation that he should pre-plan gaming time for her to make plans might be unrealistic if gaming is a casual, flexible activity. The author isn't refusing to spend time with her; he's just asserting that his gaming doesn't require her to be occupied. However, it's a balance. If the gaming was excessive and affecting their relationship, that's different. But based on the info given, the author is reasonable.\n"
