We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who wants plans made whenever he wants to game, and he's saying she doesn't need to go out every time. \n\nFirst, the guy moved in with his girlfriend, and she's upset that he plays games without making plans for her to do something else. He thought she was being funny when he suggested she watch him play, but she took it seriously. Now she expects him to plan ahead so she can have things to do when he's gaming. He argues that she can just chill on her phone or use his laptop, but she's not happy with that.\n\nI need to figure out if he's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. When couples live together, they need to balance their individual needs. The girlfriend might feel neglected if he's gaming without considering her. But the guy also has a right to his personal time. \n\nHe mentioned that before they lived together, he gave up his free time for dates, but now he's trying to reclaim some. However, living together means more shared time, so maybe his expectation to game without considering her isn't fair. The girlfriend is asking for notice so she can plan her own activities, which is reasonable. \n\nHe dismissed her feelings by saying she can just use her phone or laptop, but that might not address her need for more engaging activities. The problem arises when his gaming becomes a routine without considering her. The fact that she left to her sister's house shows she's hurt and not just being fickle. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to maintain his hobby and social connections. The issue is about finding a balance. Maybe he's not entirely wrong, but he could be more considerate. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's dismissing her feelings and not making an effort to include her, maybe he's at fault. But maybe she's overreacting. It's a bit of a gray area, but in relationships, both partners need to communicate and compromise. If he's not making an effort to include her or understand her feelings, then he might be in the wrong. So probably answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not fully considering her perspective and needs.\n"
