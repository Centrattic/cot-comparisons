It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a group of friends who don't want the author's buddy's girlfriend to come to their game nights. The author is considering telling his friend that the group doesn't want her there.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The game night is a monthly event with five friends. The girlfriend has attended four times, but she's described as annoying, self-centered, and making the group uncomfortable. She interrupts conversations, dominates the talk, and even made the author feel uncomfortable by touching and trying to engage in \"girl talk.\" The group has discussed this and all agree they don't like her being there. The author wants to confront his friend directly but in a nice way.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but we need to evaluate based on the situation. Let's consider factors like honesty, respect, and the impact on relationships.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about the group's feelings, which is important for maintaining trust among friends. The group has already talked about this, so it's a collective decision, not just the author's. They want to make the game night enjoyable again, which is a valid reason. The way the author plans to approach the conversation is respectful, avoiding harsh language and offering an alternative (a couple's night). That's considerate of the friend's relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the potential for hurting the friend's feelings. However, the author isn't lying; the group genuinely doesn't want her there. The friend might feel blindsided if the author doesn't address it, leading to resentment later. The author has already tried to be tactful, even lying once to avoid the situation, which might not have worked. So, being upfront might prevent future misunderstandings.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's behavior. She's been disruptive, so the group's desire to exclude her is understandable. The author isn't targeting her personally but addressing a collective issue. The way it's being presented is as a group decision, not just the author's preference. The author's motivation is to preserve the group's dynamic and their own enjoyment.\n\nBut is there a better way? Maybe suggesting a private conversation first, but the author is already doing that. The alternative is to keep the girlfriend coming, which the group has already decided against. The author isn't being malicious; it's about setting boundaries for the group's well-being. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest, respectful in their approach, and acting on a collective decision to maintain the group's comfort and enjoyment. The answer should be B.\n"
