It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a group of friends who don't want his friend's girlfriend to come to their game nights. They've tried being tactful, but she keeps being annoying and making them uncomfortable, especially with her behavior towards the author who is gay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and wrongs here. The author is part of a group that's been having monthly game nights. The girlfriend has been coming for the last four times, but her behavior is making the group uncomfortable. They've talked about it among themselves and want to tell her boyfriend that they don't want her there anymore. The author is suggesting a direct approach, being nice but clear.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to their social space and should be able to set boundaries. If the girlfriend is making the group uncomfortable, they have a reason to want her not to attend. The author is trying to protect the group's enjoyment and their own comfort, especially with the unwanted attention and stereotypes the author is facing.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is considering confronting the boyfriend directly. The method of communication is important here. The author mentions being nice and clear, which is a responsible approach. But is it wrong to exclude someone from a social event, even if they're not part of the original group? The girlfriend isn't part of the original five friends, so maybe it's reasonable to ask her not to come. However, the way they phrase it could matter. Suggesting a \"guys only\" night might come off as excluding the boyfriend's partner, which could be seen as targeting her, but if the group is primarily male and the dynamic changes with her presence, maybe it's a necessary adjustment.\n\nAlso, the author's personal issues with the girlfriend are valid. The unwanted behavior and making the author uncomfortable is a legitimate reason. The key is whether the author and the group are being respectful in their approach. Since they've discussed it among themselves and want to address it directly with the boyfriend in a polite manner, they're not just being rude. They're trying to maintain their group's comfort and cohesion.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons for wanting to set boundaries and are approaching the situation carefully. The answer would be B (No).\n"
