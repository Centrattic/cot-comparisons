It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who have monthly game nights. One friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times, and the group has found her annoying. The author wants to tell the friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The group used to enjoy the game nights, but the girlfriend's presence has made it unpleasant. She's described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable by pushing \"girl talk\" and invading personal space. The group has discussed this and decided to tell the friend that the dynamic has changed, making it guys-only. The author is considering being direct about it.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The group's right to enjoy their own social time is important. If the girlfriend's behavior is making the event unenjoyable for everyone except her boyfriend, the group has a valid reason to address it. However, the method of handling it is key. The author plans to be nice and suggest a different arrangement for the couple. That's a respectful approach. But is it wrong to exclude someone?\n\nExcluding a person from a social event isn't inherently wrong if the group is prioritizing their comfort and the original purpose of the gathering. The group isn't trying to be mean; they're trying to preserve their own enjoyment. The girlfriend isn't part of the group's original dynamic, so the group can reasonably choose their own company. \n\nHowever, the way the author plans to tell the friend is important. Being honest but kind, as the author suggests, is a mature approach. The author has tried to be tactful before, but the girlfriend didn't get the hint. So, the group isn't being malicious; they're taking action after attempts to address the issue politely. \n\nAnother angle: the author's personal discomfort due to the girlfriend's behavior is valid. As a gay individual, being subjected to unwanted touch and forced \"girl talk\" is an invasion of personal boundaries. The group has a right to protect their members' comfort. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for excluding the girlfriend? The question is whether the author is at fault. Since the group is the one inviting people, they can decide who attends. The main issue is how to communicate this to the friend. If the author is honest, respects the friend, and offers an alternative, it's not their fault. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the group isn't wrong to want to make the event guys-only. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to communicate this respectfully. The answer should be B (No).\n"
