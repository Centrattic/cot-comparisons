It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend isn't welcome at game night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. There's a group of friends who have monthly game nights. The friend's girlfriend has been coming the last four times, making the events unpleasant for the others. She's described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to force a gay BFF stereotype on him. The author mentions that the rest of the group agrees but they don't know how to tell their friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly and suggest making it a guys-only night.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their time without feeling uncomfortable. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly affecting their experience. The author is trying to address a problem that's been discussed among the group, so it's not just one person's opinion. The approach they plan to take is polite, suggesting an alternative (a couples night), which shows they're trying to be considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend's feelings could be hurt, but the author is being upfront and honest. They're not attacking the girlfriend but addressing the group dynamic. The key here is whether the author is justified in setting boundaries for their social gatherings. Since the group is all about their time together, it's reasonable to adjust the group composition if it's causing issues. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to preserve the event that everyone used to enjoy.\n\nAlso, the part about the author being gay and the girlfriend's behavior is an important point. Making someone uncomfortable based on their identity is a serious issue. The author has the right to feel safe and not be forced into a situation where they're being stereotyped or subjected to unwanted physical contact. The group should support that.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a valid concern that affects the group's enjoyment and the author's personal comfort. The method they're using is respectful and aims to find a solution that works for everyone involved.\n"
