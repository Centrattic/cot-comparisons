It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is part of a group of five friends who have monthly game nights. One of their friends' girlfriends has been coming along the last four times. The author and the group find her annoying because she's always trying to be the center of attention, interrupts others, and is really loud when people talk. Also, she's making the author uncomfortable by trying to force him into a \"gay BFF\" role, which he doesn't want. The group doesn't like her but isn't sure how to tell their friend. The author wants to just be honest and suggest a guys-only night and maybe a separate get-together for the couple.\n\nFirst, I should consider whether it's wrong for the author to confront their friend. The group is all in agreement that they don't want the girlfriend there. The problem is the girlfriend's behavior is making the game night unpleasant for everyone except her boyfriend. The author wants to be direct but nice, explaining that the group dynamic has changed and suggesting a different arrangement.\n\nBut is it the author's place to do this? The key here is whether the group has a right to exclude someone. Since the girlfriend was invited and the group wasn't consulted again after the first time, maybe they should have spoken up earlier. However, the group did talk about it and decided they don't want her there. The author's approach is to be honest but kind, which is a valid approach in social situations.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is problematic\u2014interrupting, being overbearing, making others uncomfortable. The author is trying to protect the group's enjoyment and their own comfort. Excluding someone might be harsh, but if the person is making others uncomfortable, it's a valid concern. However, the author should consider if the boyfriend is aware of the issues and if the author's approach is respectful and gives the boyfriend a chance to address it with his girlfriend.\n\nBut the author isn't attacking the girlfriend directly; they're addressing the boyfriend. The message is about the group dynamic, not the girlfriend's worth. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries to protect their group's social time. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
