It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who don't like the boyfriend's girlfriend coming to their game nights. They find her annoying and disruptive, especially because she's interrupting conversations and making the gay friend uncomfortable by trying to push him into a stereotype. They want to tell the boyfriend that they don't want her there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group includes five friends who used to enjoy these nights. The girlfriend has been coming for four times, and the group is now finding her presence unenjoyable. They've tried being tactful, but she's not getting the hint. The main issue is that the author is considering being direct with the friend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to approach this way.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their gatherings without discomfort. The girlfriend's behavior is causing issues, and the group isn't responsible for her actions. The author's approach is to be honest but kind, suggesting a guys-only night and maybe a separate couple meeting. That seems reasonable because they're addressing the problem without being malicious. They're not targeting the girlfriend but explaining that the group dynamic has changed.\n\nOn the other hand, could the author be wrong? Maybe if there's a better way to handle it without directly confronting the friend. Perhaps the group didn't try enough to communicate their discomfort to the girlfriend first? But the scenario says they tried being tactful and even lied to set boundaries, which she didn't respect. The group is also clear that they don't like her and want to avoid future issues. Their approach is to have an open conversation with the friend, which is a responsible way to handle the situation to maintain the friendship and the group's well-being.\n\nSo, the author's intention is to preserve the group's enjoyment and address a problem that's affecting everyone. They're not being cruel but are seeking a solution. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a valid reason and are handling it in a constructive manner.\n"
