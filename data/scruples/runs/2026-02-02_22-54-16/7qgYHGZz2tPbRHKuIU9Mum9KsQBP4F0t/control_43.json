It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author and their friends have a monthly game night. One of their friends has a girlfriend who's been coming along for four times now. The problem is that she's making the game nights unpleasant. She's described as always wanting to be the center of attention, talking nonstop, interrupting others, and even being louder when talked over. Plus, there's an issue where she's trying to make the author fit a gay stereotype, which is uncomfortable for him. The author and the group don't like her, but they're unsure how to tell their friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly and tell him that the group wants to make it guys-only.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong to do this. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the group's feelings: they genuinely dislike the girlfriend's presence. She's being disruptive, which is affecting their enjoyment. They've tried being tactful, but she doesn't take hints. The author's plan is to be upfront and suggest a guys-only game night and maybe a separate couple's get-together. \n\nIs it wrong to approach the friend directly? Sometimes, honesty is the best policy, but the way it's done matters. The author says they'd be nice about it. The main point is that the group's dynamics have changed negatively because of her. They're not just excluding her for no reason; there's a valid concern about the environment of their gatherings.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue here. How do they know that the friend would be okay with this approach? The author is considering telling the friend that the group wants to exclude his girlfriend, which is a sensitive matter. It's possible that the friend might feel betrayed or that his partner is being unfairly targeted. The key here is communication. The author is trying to be direct but respectful, aiming to preserve the friendship while addressing the group's discomfort.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the girlfriend is making him uncomfortable by trying to push him into a stereotype. That's a personal boundary issue. The fact that she showed up uninvited to a gay bar is a red flag. The author's discomfort is legitimate, but they've already tried to set boundaries, which the girlfriend ignored. \n\nIs the author overstepping by involving the friend? Maybe, but the group is collectively affected. They aren't just targeting her, but addressing the group dynamic. The author's approach is to have a conversation with the friend rather than excluding her without explanation. That seems reasonable. \n\nPotential counterarguments: The author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing real issues affecting the group. However, there's a risk that the friend might take it personally, thinking it's about his girlfriend rather than the group's collective experience. The author needs to frame it as a group dynamic issue rather than a personal judgment against the girlfriend. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention is to maintain the group's social environment and their own comfort, which is valid. The method of approaching the friend directly and respectfully is appropriate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
