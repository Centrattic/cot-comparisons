It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong if they tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend to come to game night. The author is part of a group of friends who usually have game nights, but one of their friends' girlfriend has been coming for the last four times and making it unpleasant for everyone except her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group originally had five friends, so it's a close-knit group. The girlfriend in question is described as being very domineering, interrupting conversations, and making others uncomfortable. Additionally, the author is gay and the girlfriend's behavior is making him uncomfortable by trying to push him into a stereotypical role and being overly touchy. The group has talked about it, and none of them like her, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and honest with the friend, suggesting a guys-only night and maybe a different gathering for the couple.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the author is trying to protect the group's comfort and maintain the original structure of their social gatherings. They've tried being tactful, but the girlfriend isn't taking hints. The author's approach is to communicate the issue directly but politely. On the other hand, the author is excluding someone who is in a relationship with a friend. There's a potential for hurt feelings or damaging the friendship if the message isn't delivered well. However, the author is planning to be nice and explain that the group dynamic has changed, which seems reasonable.\n\nFrom a social etiquette standpoint, when a group's dynamics are being negatively affected, it's acceptable to address the issue. However, the method and tone matter. The author's plan to have a private conversation with the friend, without being confrontational, is a good approach. Also, the fact that the group has already discussed it unanimously suggests they're not acting out of spite but genuine discomfort.\n\nAnother angle is the author's personal experience with the girlfriend's behavior, especially regarding their sexuality. This adds a layer of personal discomfort that's valid and needs to be addressed. The girlfriend's actions are crossing into personal boundaries, which is a legitimate reason for the group to seek a change.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of respecting the friend's relationship. The group might need to find a way to include the girlfriend without making the others uncomfortable. However, if the girlfriend's presence is making the events unenjoyable for everyone except her boyfriend, the group has a right to set boundaries. The key here is whether the message is delivered with respect and whether there's an alternative suggested, like a separate gathering for the couple.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't acting out of malice. They're trying to preserve the group's enjoyment and set boundaries. The approach of being direct but kind seems appropriate. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
