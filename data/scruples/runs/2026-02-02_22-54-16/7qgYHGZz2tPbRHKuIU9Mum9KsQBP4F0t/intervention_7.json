It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night.\n\nFirst, the situation: They have a monthly game night with five friends. The friend's girlfriend has come four times, which initially was fine, but now she's making the gatherings unpleasant. She's described as attention-seeking, interrupting, and making the author uncomfortable, especially regarding the author's sexuality. The group has all agreed they don't like her, and the author wants to confront the friend directly to make it a guys-only night.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the group's collective feeling versus individual rights. The author and the group are unanimous in their dislike, but is it fair to exclude someone just because they're a friend's partner? The author is gay, and the girlfriend's behavior has been intrusive and stereotyping, which adds a layer of personal discomfort.\n\nOn one hand, the group's right to set boundaries for their social events is valid. They can choose who they want to socialize with. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting their enjoyment, so they have a right to address it. On the other hand, the approach might be harsh. The author wants to be direct, which is honest, but could damage the friendship if the friend feels excluded or betrayed.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. The group is a closed circle, and they can decide their own rules. The girlfriend's presence is negatively impacting the group's experience, so excluding her could be justified. However, the method of communication is important. The author plans to be nice but honest, which is a reasonable approach. The main issue is whether the exclusion is fair given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, considering the personal aspect with the author's sexuality, the girlfriend's behavior crosses into inappropriate territory by trying to stereotype the author. That's a valid reason for discomfort. So combining the group's social dynamics and the personal discomfort, the author's decision to address it seems justified.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way? Like suggesting the friend's girlfriend might not be a good fit without naming her? However, the group has already tried being tactful without success. They've all talked about it, and the author tried lying to avoid confrontation, which didn't work. So the direct approach might be necessary.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are about protecting the group's social experience and personal boundaries. While it could strain the friendship, the intention isn't malicious. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
