It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user is part of a group of five friends who have a monthly game night. One of their friends has a girlfriend who's been joining them for the last four times. The author and the others find her annoying\u2014she's always trying to be the center of attention, talks a lot about herself, interrupts others, and even brings up the author's sexuality inappropriately. The group doesn't want her there anymore and wants to tell the friend that the game night should be guys only.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell the friend that they don't want his girlfriend at game night. Let's break down the key points.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is causing discomfort. She talks too much, interrupts, and is inconsiderate. The author, who is gay, is being forced into a role he's not comfortable with. The group has already discussed this and agrees they don't like her presence. They want to approach the friend to change the game night to be male-only.\n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette, when someone's partner affects a group dynamic negatively, the group might feel justified in addressing it. However, the method of communication matters. The author plans to be nice and straightforward, which could be respectful. But the friend's girlfriend might have a right to social interaction too unless her behavior is truly unbearable.\n\nThe user's group has tried to be tactful, but the girlfriend hasn't responded to subtle hints. The author's lie about not having female friends could be a red flag. However, if the group is unanimous in their discomfort, they have a right to set boundaries. But they should be careful not to be rude or alienate their friend. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to propose this. If the group collectively agrees and communicates it respectfully, it's not necessarily wrong. However, if the approach is harsh or dismissive, that's a different matter. The author's plan seems to be to be direct but polite. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel excluded without a proper explanation. The group could also consider other solutions, like having separate activities. But since they've already tried and nothing worked, the decision to make it a guys-only night might be valid. \n\nIn terms of the author's personal experience with the girlfriend's behavior, especially the intrusive actions regarding his sexuality, that adds a layer where his personal boundaries are being crossed. This could justify his stance.\n\nSo, balancing the friend's right to bring someone and the group's right to their own space, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're protecting their social environment from someone whose behavior is making the gatherings unpleasant. The key is that they're approaching it with the intention to be respectful and find an alternative.\n"
