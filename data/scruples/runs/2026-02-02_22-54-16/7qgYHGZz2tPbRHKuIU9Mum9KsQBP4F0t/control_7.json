It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The person is part of a group that has monthly game nights, which used to be fun but have become unpleasant since a friend's girlfriend started attending. The main issues are that the girlfriend is very self-centered, interrupts conversations, and makes the gay author uncomfortable by trying to stereotype him. The author and the group don't want her there anymore and are considering confronting the friend directly.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they plan to tell their friend that the group wants to make game night guys-only. The question is whether this is wrong. The arguments for the author being in the wrong might include that they're being dishonest or that they're excluding someone without a valid reason. The girlfriend is part of a couple, so the friend might feel excluded if they're told to have separate plans with his girlfriend. Also, maybe the author is being too harsh without giving the girlfriend another chance or addressing her behavior directly with her instead of her boyfriend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author and their friends have clearly been uncomfortable for months. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group dynamic and causing personal distress to the author. They've tried to be tactful, and the group agrees they don't want her there. The author's approach is to be honest but sensitive, suggesting an alternative meeting with the couple. That seems reasonable because the group has a right to their comfort and to set boundaries for their social gatherings.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to exclude someone because of another person's behavior? The group is doing it to protect their own enjoyment, which is understandable. However, the approach of being direct might come off as harsh, even if well-intentioned. The author might have considered other options, like discussing the issue with the girlfriend directly, but the situation involves the friend's partner, so that's complicated. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to restore the group's previous enjoyment, so maybe they're justified.\n\nAlso, the author's personal experience with the girlfriend's unwanted attention and stereotyping adds to the justification. The group's decision to make changes isn't just about preference but about addressing harassment-like behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this, especially since they've tried to be polite and the group is united in their discomfort.\n"
