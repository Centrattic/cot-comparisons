It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do?\" scenario is in the wrong. The author wants to tell his friend that his girlfriend isn't wanted at game night. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the group has monthly game nights, which were a highlight for the author. The friend's girlfriend has joined four times, making the nights unpleasant. The girlfriend is described as dominating conversations, interrupting others, and being pushy. Plus, she's making the author uncomfortable by stereotyping him as a \"gay BFF\" and being overly touchy-feely. The author and the group have discussed it but haven't told the friend yet. They're considering a direct approach.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they've tried to be tactful, but it's causing discomfort for everyone. The group doesn't like her presence, and the author is considering a direct but polite approach. The key points here are intent and communication. The author wants to preserve the group dynamic and their own comfort. However, confronting a friend about their partner can be sensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their feelings and trying to find a solution. The friend might not be aware of the full impact his girlfriend is having. The author's approach\u2014suggesting a guys-only night and a separate date for the couple\u2014is respectful. It's possible the friend would appreciate knowing the group's feelings rather than them continuing to be uncomfortable.\n\nBut is there a right or wrong here? The author isn't being malicious. They're addressing their own and the group's discomfort. However, maybe there's a better way to handle it, like the friend addressing it with his girlfriend first. But the scenario states they've tried being tactful and the girlfriend doesn't get the hint. The author's solution is to communicate directly, which is a valid approach when other methods fail.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to maintain their social group's dynamic and their own comfort. The answer should be B.\n"
