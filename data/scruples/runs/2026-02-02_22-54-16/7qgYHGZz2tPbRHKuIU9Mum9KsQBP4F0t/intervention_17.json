It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a group of friends who have monthly game nights. One friend's girlfriend has been attending for the last four times, and the group finds her annoying and disruptive. The author wants to tell their buddy that the group doesn't want his girlfriend to come anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group initially agreed to let the girlfriend come when she was first invited. But over time, her behavior has made the game nights unpleasant for everyone else. The author mentions that she's very self-centered, interrupts others, talks over people, and there are personal issues where she's been making the author uncomfortable due to their sexuality. The rest of the group agrees they don't like her presence but are unsure how to tell their friend.\n\nThe author's plan is to approach the friend directly and suggest making game nights guys-only, maybe suggesting another time for the couple to hang out. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI need to analyze if the author's intentions and actions are justified. The key points are that the group is unhappy with the girlfriend's behavior, and they're trying to communicate this in a respectful way. The author tried to be tactful before, but the girlfriend didn't get the hint. Now, the group is considering a more direct approach. Since the group is cohesive and the author is part of the group, it's reasonable for them to address the issue. However, the method might affect the answer. The author plans to be nice and honest, which is a good approach. \n\nBut is it their place to tell the friend? The friend is in a relationship, and his girlfriend's behavior is his responsibility. However, since the group collectively invited her initially, maybe it's fair to address it as a group. The main issue is whether excluding her is justified given her behavior. If her presence is making the gatherings uncomfortable for everyone else, then it's a valid concern. The author's personal discomfort is also a factor, especially regarding the stereotypes and unwanted attention. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel blindsided or that the group is being unfair. But since the author and the group have already discussed it among themselves, it's about maintaining the group's comfort and dynamics. The author isn't attacking the friend but rather addressing the girlfriend's behavior. The phrasing of the message is important here\u2014focusing on the group dynamic rather than personal issues could be key. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't acting out of malice but to preserve the group's enjoyment and their own well-being. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
