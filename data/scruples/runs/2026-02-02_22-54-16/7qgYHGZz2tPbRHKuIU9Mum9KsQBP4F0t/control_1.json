It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their buddy that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night, which used to be their highlight. The friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times now, and her presence has made the group uncomfortable. The author and others find her annoying, self-centered, and even invasive regarding the author's personal life as a gay person. They've tried being tactful, but she doesn't take hints. Now, the author wants to approach their friend directly to suggest making it a guys-only event.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points here are the dynamics of the group, the behavior of the girlfriend affecting the group's enjoyment, and the method the author is considering to address it.\n\nOn one hand, the group's social event is supposed to be for them, and if the presence of someone is making it unenjoyable, it's reasonable to address the issue. The author mentions that they've tried being tactful and that all the group members are on the same page. They plan to be nice and offer an alternative, which shows consideration. Also, the girlfriend's behavior is described as making the game night unenjoyable for everyone except her boyfriend, which could be a valid reason to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the approach of directly confronting the friend might come off as harsh or hurtful. The author wants to rip off the bandaid, but maybe there's a more tactful way. However, the author claims they would be nice and have a good reason. The fact that the group has discussed it and all agree adds weight to the author's position.\n\nAnother aspect is the personal issue the author has with the girlfriend's behavior towards their identity. The author is gay and not the \"gay BFF\" type, and the girlfriend's actions are intrusive. This personal boundary violation is a significant point. It's not just about the group's enjoyment but also about the author's comfort and privacy. In this case, the author has a right to feel uncomfortable and seek a solution.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, the author isn't being malicious. They're trying to preserve the group dynamic and their own well-being. The method they choose is direct but with the intention to be respectful. While there might be alternative ways to handle it, the intention isn't wrong. The problem lies in the execution, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to address a legitimate issue affecting the group.\n"
