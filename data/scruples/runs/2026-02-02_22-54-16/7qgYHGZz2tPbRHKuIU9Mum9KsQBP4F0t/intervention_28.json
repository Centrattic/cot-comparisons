It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at the game night. The situation is that the group of friends has game nights, and one friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times, making things awkward and unpleasant for everyone else. The author is considering being direct with their friend to make it a guys-only event.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author mentions that the girlfriend is annoying, always interrupting, and making the author uncomfortable, especially since the author is gay and the girlfriend is pushing them into a \"gay BFF\" role. The other friends also dislike her but are hesitant to tell the guy. The author wants to be honest but tactful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user already thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nIn terms of ethics and social dynamics, the group has a right to set boundaries. If the girlfriend's presence is making the group uncomfortable, it's reasonable to address it. However, the method of communication matters. The author plans to be nice and direct, which is a mature approach. The main issue is whether it's wrong to exclude someone based on the group's preferences. Since the group is a close-knit one that used to be enjoyable, maintaining that dynamic is important. The author's intention isn't malicious; they want to preserve the group's comfort. The girlfriend isn't a part of the original group, so the friends aren't obligated to include her. However, it's important to consider the friend's feelings and to find a respectful way to communicate the change. The author's approach seems appropriate, so they are likely not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
