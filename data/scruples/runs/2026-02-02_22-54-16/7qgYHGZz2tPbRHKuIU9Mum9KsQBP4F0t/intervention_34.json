It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their buddy that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. The situation is that the friend's girlfriend has been coming to the monthly game nights, but her behavior is causing discomfort for the group. She's dominating conversations, being inconsiderate, and making the author, who is gay, feel uncomfortable with her touchy-feely behavior and trying to force him into a role he doesn't want. The group has talked about it and wants to tell the friend to exclude his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is justified in their actions. The author is part of a close-knit group where game night was a highlight. The girlfriend's presence has turned these nights into something unpleasant. The group has discussed it and is united in their dislike. The author wants to approach the friend directly but in a polite way. The key points here are the group's collective discomfort, the girlfriend's specific behaviors that make the events unbearable, and the intention to communicate this respectfully.\n\nThe potential issue here is that the author is going to address the friend directly. While the group's sentiment is shared, the author might be taking it upon themselves to speak for the group. But since the group has already discussed it, it seems they are on the same page. The approach the author plans to take is to suggest making game night guys-only and maybe have a separate couples' night. That seems reasonable and considerate, as it's not outright rejecting the friend but proposing an alternative.\n\nAnother angle is the author's personal experience with the girlfriend. The girlfriend's actions towards the author are particularly invasive, such as trying to make him fit a stereotype and showing up uninvited to his gay bar outing. This adds a layer of personal discomfort beyond just group dynamics. The author has already tried to be tactful, but the girlfriend isn't taking hints. So, there's a valid reason for the author to feel this is necessary.\n\nHowever, there's a risk in the approach. Telling a friend that their partner is unwanted can strain the friendship. It's important that the author approaches this with empathy and focuses on the group's needs, not just their own. The proposed message seems to address the group dynamic and offers a solution rather than just blaming the girlfriend. That's a positive aspect.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The group has a right to enjoy their gatherings without being uncomfortable, and the author is trying to handle the situation respectfully. The key is that they are communicating the group's feelings in a constructive way, not just excluding someone out of spite. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
