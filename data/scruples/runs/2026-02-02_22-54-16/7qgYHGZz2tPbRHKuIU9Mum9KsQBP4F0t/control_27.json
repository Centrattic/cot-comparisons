It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend isn't welcome at game night. The author explains that the girlfriend is annoying, dominating conversations, and making things uncomfortable, especially for the author who is gay. The group has talked about it and doesn't like her, but they don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and suggest making it a guys-only event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and their friends are part of a regular game night, which is a social gathering they all look forward to. The introduction of the girlfriend has changed the dynamic negatively. The girlfriend's behavior is described as interruptive and attention-seeking, which is affecting everyone's enjoyment. Additionally, the author feels targeted by the girlfriend's attempts to stereotype them, which is a personal issue that's been ongoing. The author has tried to be polite but hasn't received the desired response.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to address this. On one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their own social time, and if someone's presence is making it unpleasant, they might need to set boundaries. The author is trying to be respectful by approaching their friend directly and offering an alternative (a different get-together). On the other hand, it's possible that the author's actions could hurt the friend, especially if the friend feels excluded or if the girlfriend's presence was intended to be inclusive.\n\nHowever, the key points are that the group has collectively discussed the issue, and they're united in their discomfort. The author's approach is to communicate the change in dynamics and suggest a separate arrangement for the couple. This seems like a reasonable way to handle it, as they're not rejecting the friend but the girlfriend's presence. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to preserve the group's enjoyment and personal comfort, especially given the specific issues like the stereotype and invasion of personal space.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a shared concern respectfully and seeking a solution that maintains the group's social time without conflict. The answer should be B (No).\n"
