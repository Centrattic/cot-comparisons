It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their buddy that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night. The scenario is that the group of friends has game nights, and the buddy's girlfriend has been coming for the last four times. The author and others find her annoying and disruptive. The main issues are her talkative and interrupting behavior, the fact that she's being touchy-feely with the author (who is gay but not the \"gay best friend\" type), and she even showed up uninvited to his event once.\n\nThe author is thinking of confronting the friend directly, being nice but firm. The key points here are whether the group has the right to exclude her and if the approach is appropriate. \n\nFirst, the group might feel that the dynamic has changed, and they want to keep it a guys-only event. But the initial problem is that the girlfriend wasn't invited from the start, but the friend asked if she could come. Now, four times later, they're finding her presence uncomfortable. \n\nIs it fair to exclude her? Well, the group's social events might be intended for them, but when someone's partner is invited, it's a different dynamic. However, if the friend didn't know that the group wanted to keep it guys-only, then the author's approach might be necessary to set boundaries. The author mentions they've discussed it among themselves but haven't told the friend yet. The idea is to be honest but kind. \n\nAnother angle is the author's personal discomfort with the girlfriend's behavior towards him. He's gay but isn't comfortable with the \"gay best friend\" role, yet the girlfriend pushes that. That's a personal boundary issue. The author tried to be tactful but she doesn't take the hint. So, the author has a legitimate reason for personal space.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for wanting to address this? If the group collectively agrees and approaches the friend respectfully, it's about maintaining their social space. It's their event, and they have the right to set boundaries. However, they need to consider the friend's feelings and the girlfriend's perspective. But since the author is planning to be nice and explain the group dynamic, it seems reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're trying to protect their social environment and personal boundaries without being malicious. The key is that they're acting in a group and intending to communicate it respectfully.\n"
