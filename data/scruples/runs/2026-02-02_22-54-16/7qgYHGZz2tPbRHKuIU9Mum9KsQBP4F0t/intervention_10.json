It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night.\n\nFirst, the situation: The group has monthly game nights, which used to be fun but have become unpleasant since the friend's girlfriend started coming. She's described as attention-seeking, interruptive, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to impose a stereotype on them. The rest of the group agrees they don't like her there but don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and suggest making it a guys-only event.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, the author is trying to protect the group's comfort and the original purpose of the gathering. They've tried to be tactful but the girlfriend isn't taking hints. The group is united in their discomfort. On the other hand, the author is being honest and upfront, which could be seen as necessary. However, maybe there's a more diplomatic way? But the author mentions they've tried being nice and the girlfriend isn't getting the hint. \n\nAlso, the author's personal experience with the girlfriend's behavior (making them uncomfortable as a gay man) adds another layer. It's about personal boundaries and harassment, which is serious. The author has the right to feel safe and respected. \n\nIs there a chance the author is overstepping? Maybe, but the group consensus is that they don't want her there. The key point is that the author isn't being malicious; they're trying to address a genuine issue that's affecting the group dynamic. The approach is to be honest but kind, suggesting an alternative. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is likely B.\n"
