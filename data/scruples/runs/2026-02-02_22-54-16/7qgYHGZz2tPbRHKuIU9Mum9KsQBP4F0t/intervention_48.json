It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night. The situation is that the girlfriend's behavior is making the game nights unpleasant for everyone except the friend. The author and others have discussed it, and they all agree they don't like her presence but aren't sure how to tell the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. The author is part of a group that's been meeting regularly, and the dynamic has changed because of the girlfriend's behavior. She's described as interrupting others, being domineering, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to impose stereotypes. The group has tried being tactful but to no avail. The author wants to approach the friend directly but in a respectful way.\n\nIs it wrong to confront someone about their partner's behavior? Well, the friend's girlfriend is affecting the group's enjoyment. The author is trying to be honest but kind. The proposed approach seems reasonable: telling the friend that the group dynamic has changed and suggesting a different arrangement. The key here is whether the author has a right to express the group's discomfort. Since the group has discussed it and they all agree, the author isn't acting alone. \n\nHowever, there's a risk of hurting the friend's feelings. The author is trying to be tactful, which is important. The main issue is the girlfriend's behavior, not the fact that she's his partner. The author isn't attacking the friend but the situation. The question is whether the author is overstepping by addressing it. \n\nIn many cases, friends have a responsibility to communicate their boundaries. If the girlfriend's presence is causing discomfort for everyone except the friend, then it's reasonable for the group to express that. The author is not being cruel but seeking to maintain the group's dynamic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
