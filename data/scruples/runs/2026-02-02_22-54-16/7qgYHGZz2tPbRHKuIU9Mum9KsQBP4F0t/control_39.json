It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The group has a monthly game night, and one friend's girlfriend has been joining the last four times. The author and others find her annoying\u2014she's talkative, interrupts, and makes the author uncomfortable because she's trying to make him fit a gay stereotype. The group doesn't like her presence anymore and wants to tell the friend directly but are unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: the group used to enjoy the game night, the girlfriend's behavior has made it unpleasant, and there's a personal issue with the author's discomfort regarding the girlfriend's actions. The group has discussed it and agrees. The author wants to address it bluntly but nicely.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships. Friends often have to give feedback when something's bothering them. The girlfriend was initially accepted but now her behavior is causing issues. The group's intention is to make their game night enjoyable again, which is reasonable. However, the approach matters. The author wants to be direct, which can be effective but might come off as harsh. They mention being nice, so maybe it's not malicious.\n\nBut is it the author's place to do this? Since the girlfriend isn't part of their usual group, maybe they should address it through the friend first. Also, the author is part of the group making the decision, so if they all agree, it's collective. However, the girlfriend might feel excluded without explanation. The author is targeting their friend's girlfriend, which could strain the friendship if not handled carefully.\n\nLegally or ethically, there's no wrongdoing in wanting to adjust the group dynamic. The problem is more about social etiquette. The group's right to enjoy their time without discomfort is valid. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to communicate their feelings. The main issue is how to convey it without hurting the friend's feelings. Since the author is considering being tactful, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Like suggesting the friend and girlfriend come together another time, as the author mentioned. If the group is united, their approach is justified. So, the answer would be B, not in the wrong. However, if the author is acting out of personal dislike without considering the friend's perspective, that's a problem. But the scenario shows the group discussed it together, so it's a collective decision. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address it.\n"
