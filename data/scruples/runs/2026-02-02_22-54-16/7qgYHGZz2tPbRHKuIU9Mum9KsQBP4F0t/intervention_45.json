It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night that used to be fun, but the friend's girlfriend has been coming the last four times and made it unpleasant. The girlfriend is described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and being overbearing. Also, she's making the author, who's gay but not the \"gay best friend\" type, uncomfortable with touchy-feely behavior and girl talk. The author and others have discussed it but don't know how to tell the friend. They want to be direct but nice.\n\nNow, the author is considering being the one to tell the friend. The main question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the group's right to have a comfortable environment is important. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group's enjoyment, so the group has a reason to want to exclude her. But is it the author's place to be the one to tell the friend? \n\nThe author is part of the group, and they've already discussed it among themselves. The author's intention is to maintain the group dynamic, which was their highlight. They plan to be respectful and suggest a different time for the couple. The author is being proactive to restore the group's original purpose.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue of being honest versus tactful. The author is concerned about the friend's feelings but thinks being direct is better. If the group collectively agrees, it's reasonable for the author to speak up. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should consider if there were other ways to address the issue first, like giving the girlfriend more feedback privately or the friend being more direct with her. But since the group has already discussed it and the girlfriend isn't taking hints, the group's next step is justified.\n\nThe author's motivation is to protect the group's bonding time, which is valid. They aren't attacking the girlfriend personally but addressing the impact on the group. The proposed approach is respectful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the situation. The answer is B.\n"
