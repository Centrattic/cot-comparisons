It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of friends having a monthly game night, and one friend's girlfriend has been joining. The writer and others find her annoying and uncomfortable, especially given the writer's sexuality. They want to tell the friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The group has five friends getting together, originally a social event they enjoyed. The friend's girlfriend has been coming for the last four times, and her behavior is causing issues. She's described as interrupting, being self-centered, and making the writer uncomfortable by trying to force a \"gay best friend\" stereotype. The group has discussed it and agrees they don't like her presence, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The writer wants to be direct, suggesting a guys-only night and maybe a different time for the couple.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are not, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the group is the original five friends, so they might feel their dynamic is being disrupted. The girlfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author is trying to protect the group's comfort. The author's intentions are to restore the original dynamic and address a genuine issue they're facing. The approach suggested is to talk to the friend directly and respectfully, not to exclude the girlfriend maliciously but to refocus the group's time with each other.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's girlfriend is part of his life now, and the group might feel they need to consider his feelings. However, the group has already discussed it among themselves, indicating they're all on the same page. The problem is the girlfriend's behavior, not just her presence. The author is not suggesting being cruel; they're proposing a solution that could benefit everyone by separating the group time from the couple time. The friend might need to be informed, and the method proposed seems considerate.\n\nAnother angle: the writer is gay, and the girlfriend's actions are making him uncomfortable by trying to impose a stereotype. This adds a personal layer where the author's well-being is at stake. The group has a right to feel comfortable in their own social setting.\n\nPotential issues to consider: Did the group give the girlfriend a chance to improve her behavior? The author mentions they've tried being tactful and even lied to her, but she didn't take the hint. So maybe they've made efforts to address the issue without success. The situation has persisted for four times, and the problem is ongoing. The group might have a valid reason to set boundaries.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe, but the author's approach is to communicate directly. The answer hinges on whether the group has a right to maintain their original dynamic and whether the girlfriend's presence is genuinely disruptive. Since the problem is her behavior, not her gender, the group might be justified in wanting to exclude her to preserve their enjoyment. The author isn't targeting her because she's a woman but because of her actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this to restore the group's original dynamic.\n"
