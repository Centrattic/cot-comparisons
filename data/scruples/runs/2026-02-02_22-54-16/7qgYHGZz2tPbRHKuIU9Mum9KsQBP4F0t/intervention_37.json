It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend isn't welcome at game night. The situation is that the group of friends has a monthly game night, which used to be fun, but the friend's girlfriend has been coming four times and making it unpleasant. She's interrupting conversations, being overbearing, and the author is gay, and she's been making him uncomfortable with touchy-feely behavior and trying to make him the \"gay BFF.\"\n\nThe author wants to tell the friend that the group prefers it to be guys-only now. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is part of a group that's been negatively affected by the girlfriend's presence. They've discussed it and agree they don't like her there. The author feels it's time to address it directly to their friend. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest and trying to protect the group's comfort. They want to be nice about it, not confrontational. They're trying to find a solution that allows the friend to still be part of the group but as a couple on a different night. That seems reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a judgment about the girlfriend and not the friend. The friend might take it personally, even if the message is about the group dynamic. The author might be seen as excluding someone without giving them a chance to change, but the girlfriend has been coming four times and the behavior hasn't improved. The author tried to be tactful, but it didn't work. \n\nThe key points are that the group is unanimous in their discomfort, they've discussed it, and the author is approaching it respectfully. The author is not being malicious but is trying to maintain the group's enjoyment. The girlfriend's behavior is disruptive and disrespectful, which makes the author's actions more justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're addressing a real issue that affects the group, and they're doing it in a considerate way. The author isn't targeting the girlfriend personally but the situation. They're also offering an alternative to include the friend. So, the right choice is B.\n"
