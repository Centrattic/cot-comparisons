It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully. The person is part of a monthly game night with five friends. It used to be their highlight, but now one of their friend's girlfriends has been coming four times in a row. The author mentions that she's annoying, always the center of attention, interrupts others, brings conversations back to herself, talks over people, and even raises her voice. Plus, because the author is gay, the girlfriend tries to make them into a \"gay bff\" type, which is uncomfortable. The author has lied to her about not having female friends, but she doesn't take the hint. The rest of the group also dislikes her, and they want to tell the friend to stop bringing her. The author wants to just be direct and suggest making game night guys-only and maybe having a separate time for the couple.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). So, the key points here are about the girlfriend's behavior affecting the group's enjoyment, the author's personal discomfort, and the group's collective decision to address it. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to address a problem that's affecting their social circle. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly disruptive, and the group has discussed it. The author is being direct but plans to be nice. However, the way to approach it is important. They're not attacking the girlfriend personally but suggesting a change in the group dynamic. Also, the issue of the author being gay and the girlfriend's intrusive behavior adds a layer of personal discomfort. The author has tried to be polite and even lied once, but it didn't work. So, the group's right to want to keep their game night as a guys-only event might be valid, especially if it's their shared space and the only time they all get together. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author should have addressed it more privately or with more sensitivity? The problem is the friend's girlfriend is making others uncomfortable. The author's intention is to preserve the group's enjoyment and their own comfort. However, the author is considering going to the friend directly and being honest, which is a reasonable approach. They mention being nice, so it's not about being cruel. The alternative could be that the group is being intolerant or not considering the girlfriend's presence as a potential opportunity to include her, but if the girlfriend is actively ruining the experience, then it's understandable to want to change the dynamic. \n\nAlso, the part where the girlfriend showed up uninvited at a gay bar is a significant issue. That's a personal boundary that was crossed, and the author is justified in being upset. The friend not noticing the discomfort is another red flag. The group's consensus is important here. If everyone agrees that her presence is a problem, then the author isn't wrong for wanting to address it. \n\nBut is it wrong to exclude his girlfriend? The friend might see it as the group not accepting the relationship. However, the group's right to have a space that works for them is also valid. The author is not saying they can't be friends as a couple, just that the game night should be guys-only. So maybe it's a matter of setting boundaries, which is okay. \n\nI think the author is correct in wanting to protect their social environment. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to be uncomfortable and the group's preference is to maintain the original dynamic. The key is that they are being respectful and trying to find a solution without being hostile towards the girlfriend. Instead, they're focusing on the group's needs and the friend's relationship. So, B makes sense.\n"
