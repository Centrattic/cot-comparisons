It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend isn't wanted at game night. The situation is that the girlfriend is making the game night unpleasant for everyone except the boyfriend. The author wants to approach the friend directly to suggest making it a guys-only night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group of friends has a monthly game night, which used to be a highlight. The girlfriend has been coming for the last four times, and her behavior is causing issues. She's described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to impose stereotypes related to his sexuality. The author and others have already discussed it but don't know how to approach the friend. The plan is to be direct but nice, explaining that the group dynamic has changed and suggesting a different gathering for the couple.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to address a problem that's affecting the group's enjoyment. They're being honest about their feelings and trying to maintain the group's original purpose. On the other hand, confronting the friend might hurt his feelings, especially if he's invested in including his girlfriend. But the author mentions that they've already talked about it and plan to be respectful. The key points are that the group's preference is to exclude her, and the author is advocating for that, which could be seen as standing up for the group's well-being rather than being mean-spirited.\n\nAdditionally, the author has tried to be tactful before, but the girlfriend isn't getting the hint. There's a valid concern about personal boundaries, especially regarding the author's discomfort with the girlfriend's behavior towards them. In such cases, it's understandable to want to address the situation to maintain comfort and the original intent of the game night.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the author is being harsh by not giving the girlfriend another chance or not addressing her directly first. But since the group has already discussed it and the author's approach is to be straightforward yet kind, it seems like a reasonable step. The author isn't attacking the girlfriend but explaining the group's need for a different dynamic. So, the action is about the group's preferences rather than a personal attack on the girlfriend.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to resolve a conflict that's affecting everyone's enjoyment and their personal comfort. The approach is direct but respectful, which is appropriate in maintaining group dynamics and individual boundaries.\n"
