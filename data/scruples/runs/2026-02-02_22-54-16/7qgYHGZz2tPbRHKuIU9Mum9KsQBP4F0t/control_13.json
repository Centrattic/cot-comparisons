It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. The situation is that the group of friends has a monthly game night, and the friend's girlfriend has been coming the last four times. She's described as annoying, dominating conversations, interrupting others, and the author, who is gay, feels uncomfortable with her trying to make him the \"gay BFF\" and invading his personal space.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics here. The author mentions that the group has talked about it and everyone except the boyfriend is uncomfortable with the girlfriend's presence. They want to maintain a guys-only night. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to confront the friend.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the group dynamic has changed and they want to keep it male-only. But is that a valid reason? If the girlfriend's behavior is making the others uncomfortable, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for addressing it. However, the approach might matter. Telling a friend directly that their girlfriend isn't welcome could be seen as harsh, even if the group is unified in their feelings.\n\nAnother angle: the author is part of a group that's been meeting regularly, and the inclusion of the girlfriend has disrupted it. They tried to be tactful, but she didn't get the hint. So maybe the author isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group's enjoyment, so the author is trying to protect the group's social space.\n\nBut is the author overstepping? The girlfriend is part of their friend's life, and excluding her without a proper discussion might be seen as rude. However, if the group is collectively uncomfortable and the author is acting on behalf of the group, maybe it's justified. The key is whether the author is being respectful and honest in their approach. The proposed message is to suggest a change in the group dynamic, which is a reasonable way to handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have tried more subtle methods first, like the friend talking to his girlfriend privately. But if the friend isn't aware of the issue, then the author's approach is necessary. The author isn't attacking the girlfriend personally but stating that the group prefers to meet as guys only, which is a valid social boundary.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to address a problem that's affecting their social group's enjoyment. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
