It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend isn't welcome at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has monthly game nights, which are supposed to be a fun, casual hangout. The friend's girlfriend has been coming for four months, and the group finds her annoying. She's disruptive, dominating conversations, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable with her behavior, especially since the author is gay and doesn't want to be stereotyped. The group has discussed this and agrees they don't like her, but they're unsure how to tell their friend. The author wants to confront him directly and tactfully.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points here are communication, respect, and the impact on others. The group has discussed the issue and felt that the girlfriend's presence is making the game nights unpleasant. They're not just one person's opinion but a collective feeling. The author is planning to approach their friend to set boundaries, which is a common way to handle group dynamics.\n\nHowever, approaching the friend directly without involving the girlfriend might be seen as cutting her out without considering her perspective. But in this case, the author mentions that they've tried to be tactful before, and the girlfriend didn't take hints. The group is unified in their discomfort, so it's reasonable to address the issue. The author's intention is to maintain the group's comfort and the original purpose of game night. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the group could have tried to address the issue with the girlfriend directly first, even if it's uncomfortable. But considering the author's specific discomfort with the girlfriend's behavior (like the uninvited visit to the gay bar and the touchy-feely actions), it's understandable that they want to set clear boundaries. The author is also planning to be respectful in their approach, which is important.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to protect the group's social space and address valid concerns. The answer should be B (No).\n"
