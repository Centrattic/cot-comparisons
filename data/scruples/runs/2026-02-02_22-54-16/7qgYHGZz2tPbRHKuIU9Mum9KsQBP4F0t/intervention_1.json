It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, the context: The group of friends has monthly game nights, which used to be enjoyable but have become unpleasant since the friend's girlfriend started coming. She's described as attention-seeking, disruptive, and making the author uncomfortable, especially because of her behavior regarding the author's sexuality. The group has all talked about it and agrees they don't like her there. The author wants to approach the friend directly but in a respectful way.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Is it wrong to address a friend about their partner's negative impact on group dynamics? The author's intention is to restore the group's comfort and original dynamic. They plan to be polite and suggest an alternative. However, there's the risk of hurting the friend's feelings and possibly damaging the friendship. But the group has already discussed it, so it's a collective decision, not just the author's.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is problematic, and the author has tried being tactful without success. The friend might not be aware of how his girlfriend's actions are affecting others. By addressing it, the group is trying to protect their social environment. However, the method of communication could affect the outcome. The author's approach seems genuine and respectful, not malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have given the friend more time to realize the issue on his own or handled it more privately. But given that the group has all agreed and the situation has been ongoing, direct communication might be necessary. The key is whether the approach is honest and not mean-spirited. The author plans to be kind and offer an alternative, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The group has a right to address a situation that's affecting their enjoyment, especially when the problem is clear and persistent. The author's intention is to maintain group harmony, and they're planning to communicate it respectfully.\n"
