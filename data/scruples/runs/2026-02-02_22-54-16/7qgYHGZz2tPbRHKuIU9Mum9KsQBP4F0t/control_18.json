It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has monthly game nights, originally five guys. The friend's girlfriend has joined the last four times, making the gatherings unpleasant. She's described as annoying, dominating conversations, interrupting, and even making the author uncomfortable by trying to push their gay identity onto them. The group has discussed this and wants to tell the friend, but they're unsure how. The author wants to confront the friend directly.\n\nNow, the key points here. The group's gatherings were their highlight, so the girlfriend's presence has changed that. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author is part of the group that's been talking about this, and they're considering a direct approach.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to communicate a problem. The issue is that the girlfriend's presence is making the group uncomfortable. The author's intention is to maintain the group's enjoyment, but the method of confronting the friend could be problematic. \n\nBut wait, the author is part of the group that's already discussed the issue. They're not acting alone. The problem is whether they have a right to exclude the girlfriend. The friend might feel betrayed if the group doesn't want his partner. But the group is private, and they have the right to set boundaries. The girlfriend's behavior is toxic, so the group's right to exclude her is valid. However, the way they approach it matters. The author's plan is to be nice but direct, which is reasonable. \n\nBut maybe the author is overstepping by making the friend's girlfriend the problem. However, the group's dynamics have changed, and they have a right to address it. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to preserve the group's enjoyment. The answer hinges on whether the group is justified in excluding someone. Since the group is private and the presence of the girlfriend is affecting everyone's experience, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B, No.\n"
