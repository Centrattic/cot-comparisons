It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night anymore. The situation is that the group of friends has a monthly game night, and the friend's girlfriend has been coming for the last four times, making it unpleasant for everyone else. The author describes her as attention-seeking, interruptive, and even making things awkward by trying to push the author into a \"gay BFF\" stereotype. The group has talked about it and wants to keep it a guys-only thing now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is part of a close-knit group that values their game nights as a time to relax and hang out with each other. The girlfriend's presence is causing discomfort and making the gatherings less enjoyable. The friends have discussed it and are considering telling the friend directly but in a nice way.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the group has a right to set boundaries for their social gatherings. If the girlfriend's behavior is making the event unenjoyable for everyone except her boyfriend, it's reasonable for the group to want to change the dynamic. The key point is whether they're being fair in how they communicate this. The author plans to be honest but kind, explaining that the group dynamic has changed and suggesting a separate time for the couple. That approach seems respectful, as it's not just about excluding the girlfriend but redefining the event's purpose.\n\nHowever, there might be other perspectives. The friend's girlfriend might feel excluded, and the friends could be seen as being judgmental. But since the group has discussed it and the majority are uncomfortable, their right to set boundaries takes precedence. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to preserve the group's enjoyment. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
