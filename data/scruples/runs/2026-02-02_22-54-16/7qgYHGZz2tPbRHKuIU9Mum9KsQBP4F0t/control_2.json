It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The person wants to tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend to come to game night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group of friends has a monthly game night that's usually just the five of them. One friend's girlfriend has been coming the last four times. Initially, they didn't mind, but now the girlfriend is making it unpleasant. She's described as attention-seeking, talkative, interrupts others, and is even making the author uncomfortable by trying to push the gay stereotype. The group has discussed it and all agree they don't like her presence but don't know how to tell the friend. The author plans to confront the friend directly but nicely.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The group is excluding someone (the girlfriend) because they don't like her. But is it their right to do so? The group is a private gathering; they can choose who attends. However, they're making a judgment based on the girlfriend's behavior and the friend might feel betrayed if they don't know. The author wants to be honest but tactful. The problem is that the girlfriend's behavior is causing discomfort for everyone except her boyfriend. The group is trying to communicate this to the friend, not the girlfriend directly. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to tell the friend? If the group is honest and respectful in their approach, maybe not. However, there might be a better way to handle it, like suggesting the girlfriend attends another event or discussing it with the friend without being harsh. But since the group has already discussed it and wants to address it, the author's approach might be justified. The key is whether their intent is to be honest and maintain the group's comfort without being malicious. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) if they're approaching the friend respectfully. However, there's a risk of hurting the friend's feelings, but the scenario states they want to be nice about it. \n\nAlso, the stereotype issue is a red flag. The girlfriend's behavior is making the author uncomfortable, which is valid. The group's collective feeling is that they don't want her there. So, from a group dynamics perspective, they have a right to set boundaries. The author isn't just acting alone; it's the group's decision. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
