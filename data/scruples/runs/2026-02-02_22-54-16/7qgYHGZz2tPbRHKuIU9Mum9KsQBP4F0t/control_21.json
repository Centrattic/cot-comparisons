It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend isn't wanted at game night. \n\nFirst, the context: the group has monthly game nights, which used to be fun but now are ruined by the girlfriend's behavior. She's described as annoying, self-centered, and disrespectful in conversations. Plus, there's the issue with the author being gay and the girlfriend making them feel uncomfortable with touchy-feely behavior and trying to push them into a \"gay best friend\" stereotype. The group has discussed it and all agree they don't like her presence, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly and respectfully.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is wrong. The key points here are the group's collective discomfort and the specific issues caused by the girlfriend. The author's intention is to protect the group's dynamic and their own well-being. However, they need to communicate this without blaming the girlfriend personally, focusing instead on the group's preference for a guys-only night. \n\nIt's important to note that the author is being honest but tactful. They're not attacking the girlfriend directly but explaining a change in the group's dynamic. The main issue is whether it's right to exclude someone based on their partner's presence. However, since the group has discussed it and all agree, it's a collective decision, not just the author's. The author is taking the initiative to address it, which is necessary for the group's comfort. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior has been problematic, so the group's desire to exclude her isn't just about gender but about the specific issues she causes. The author's personal discomfort, especially regarding their identity being misappropriated, is a valid reason to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a real issue that affects everyone and are approaching it respectfully. The decision is group-based, and they're protecting their own and others' comfort. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
