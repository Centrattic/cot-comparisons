It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand the situation. The author and their friends have a monthly game night that's been a highlight for them. A friend's girlfriend started joining, and over four times, her presence has turned the gatherings into something unpleasant. The girlfriend is described as very self-centered, interrupting others, being loud, and making the author uncomfortable by trying to push him into a \"gay best friend\" role, even going as far as showing up uninvited at a gay bar. The author and others have discussed this and don't want her there, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly and suggest making it a guys-only night.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the factors here.\n\nOn one hand, the author is part of a group that's formed a social contract for a guys-only game night. The girlfriend's presence is making the event uncomfortable for everyone else. The author has tried to be tactful, even lied about not having female friends, but the girlfriend keeps pushing. The group has discussed it and agrees they don't want her there. The author's approach seems to be to be honest but kind, explaining the group dynamic change and suggesting an alternative.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is overstepping by not being more diplomatic. Perhaps they should have tried talking to the friend earlier or more delicately. Also, the author's lie about not having female friends might be seen as manipulative. However, given how the girlfriend is acting, maybe the author felt cornered. The friend's girlfriend is not respecting the group's boundaries, and the author is trying to address it to preserve the group's social time.\n\nAnother angle: Is it fair to exclude someone just because they're part of a friend's relationship? But the group is specifically a guys-only night, so maybe it's reasonable to maintain that dynamic. The problem is the girlfriend's behavior, not her gender per se. However, the author mentions the girlfriend is trying to make them into the \"gay BFF\" type, which might be a specific issue related to the author's identity.\n\nThe author's proposed solution is to tell the friend that the group dynamic has changed and suggest a different arrangement. If done in a kind and honest way, this might be a reasonable approach. The group has discussed it, so it's not just the author's opinion. The key is whether the approach is respectful and not malicious.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to address a problem that's affecting their social group, and they're being honest in their approach. The wrong would be in the girlfriend's behavior, not the author's intention to address it. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
