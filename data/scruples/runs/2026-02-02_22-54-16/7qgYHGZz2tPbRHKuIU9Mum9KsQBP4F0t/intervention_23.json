It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who don't want the girlfriend to come to game night because she's being annoying and making them uncomfortable, especially since one of the friends is gay and the girlfriend is pressuring him. The author wants to confront their buddy to tell him that the group wants to keep it guys-only.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group has discussed this among themselves and agrees they don't like her presence. The girlfriend's behavior is described as domineering and intrusive, making the game nights unpleasant. The author is trying to be tactful but hasn't found a way to communicate this to the friend yet. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to tell their friend directly.\n\nOn one hand, the author is part of a group that collectively agrees on the problem. They're not just acting out of personal dislike but trying to preserve the group's dynamic. The girlfriend's actions are affecting their enjoyment, and the author is trying to address it respectfully by suggesting a solution. The author is also considering the friend's feelings by proposing a different get-together as a couple, which shows they're not just excluding the girlfriend but offering an alternative.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a more diplomatic way to handle it. The author admits they've tried to be tactful but the girlfriend doesn't get the hint. The situation has been ongoing for four times, and the group has already talked about it. The key point here is that the author is trying to address a legitimate issue that's affecting the group's enjoyment and the individual's comfort, especially regarding the gay friend's boundaries. The author isn't being mean or malicious; they're just trying to maintain their social space.\n\nThe main ethical consideration is whether it's wrong to exclude someone from a social event they were allowed to attend initially. However, since the group has already discussed it and the author is acting in a respectful manner, it seems like a reasonable approach. The author isn't targeting the friend but the girlfriend's behavior. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
