It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong if they tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend to come to game night. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night with five friends. One friend's girlfriend has joined four times, but she's described as annoying, monopolizing conversation, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable due to her behavior, including inappropriate touches and trying to force a \"gay best friend\" dynamic. The group has discussed this and doesn't like her, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to confront the friend directly but in a nice way.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are the behavior of the girlfriend and the approach the author is considering.\n\nOn one hand, the author's group is uncomfortable and the girlfriend's actions are making the gatherings unpleasant. They have a right to enjoy their time without feeling harassed. The author is trying to address a problem that's affecting their group dynamic. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly disruptive, and the group has discussed it, so there's a consensus.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is directly confronting the friend. While they plan to be nice, the approach might hurt the friend's feelings. The friend might feel that his partner is being rejected by the group. Also, the author mentions lying once to the girlfriend (\"I don't have female friends\"), which shows that the author has tried to be polite but the girlfriend didn't heed the hints. However, the author's intention is to preserve the group's enjoyment and comfort, which is valid.\n\nThe main ethical consideration is whether the author is justified in excluding someone due to their behavior. Since the group is a private, regular gathering, they can set boundaries. The girlfriend's actions are making it unenjoyable for others, so it's reasonable to address it. The method of communication is important; the author plans to be respectful and suggest an alternative (couple's night), which is a considerate approach.\n\nHowever, there are potential downsides. The friend might feel betrayed, and the author's directness could strain the friendship. But given that the group has discussed this and the girlfriend's behavior is problematic, the author isn't acting out of malice. The key is whether the author's actions are justified in self-defense and group cohesion.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate issue that affects their group's well-being. The approach, while direct, is intended to be respectful. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
