It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this scenario. The situation is about a group of friends who have a monthly game night, and one friend's girlfriend has been coming along, making the nights unpleasant. The author wants to tell the friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the description. The girlfriend is described as being very self-centered, interrupting conversations, and making the group uncomfortable. Additionally, the author is gay and feels that the girlfriend is trying to push him into a \"gay BFF\" stereotype, which is making him uncomfortable. The rest of the group also shares these feelings, and they've talked about it but don't know how to approach the friend. The author is considering being direct and telling the friend that the game night should be guys-only now.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants me to assess based on the situation. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author is part of a group that genuinely feels uncomfortable due to the girlfriend's behavior. The girlfriend's actions are affecting their enjoyment and potentially violating their boundaries. The author is trying to address a legitimate issue that's impacting their social time. Also, the author is being considerate by planning to approach the friend respectfully and suggest an alternative arrangement, like meeting as a couple another time.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of honesty and communication. The friend might feel blindsided if the author is too direct, and the way the message is phrased could be seen as excluding the girlfriend without addressing her behavior. However, the author is not being confrontational but rather explaining a change in group dynamics. Also, the girlfriend's behavior is problematic, so the group has a right to set boundaries to protect their comfort and the nature of the game night.\n\nAnother point is the author's personal experience with the girlfriend's actions towards him. The girlfriend's behavior towards him is inappropriate, given his identity and personal boundaries. This adds another layer where the author's discomfort is valid and needs to be addressed.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for groups to have certain dynamics and make adjustments when a new person's presence changes the atmosphere. The key is how they communicate it. The author is planning to be honest but kind, which is a balanced approach. The friend might need to be informed, especially since the group has already discussed it and decided on a course of action.\n\nPotential issues could arise if the friend feels that the group is being unfair or if the message is delivered without consideration. However, the scenario suggests that the group has already considered these aspects and is planning to handle it respectfully.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. They are addressing a legitimate issue that affects the group's well-being and personal boundaries. The approach is thoughtful, aiming to maintain the friendship while setting necessary boundaries.\n"
