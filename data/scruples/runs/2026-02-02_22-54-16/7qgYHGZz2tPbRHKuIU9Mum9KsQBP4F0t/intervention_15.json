It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key details. The group has a monthly game night that's been a highlight for them. The friend's girlfriend has attended the last four times, but her behavior is making the event unpleasant. She's described as annoying, attention-seeking, and disruptive. There's also the issue of her making the author uncomfortable due to their gay identity, which adds another layer of personal distress.\n\nThe group has discussed this and all agree they don't like her presence. The author wants to confront the friend directly but in a respectful way. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to have this conversation.\n\nLegally and ethically, group dynamics can be complex. Friends have the right to set boundaries about who is included in their gatherings. However, the way the message is delivered matters. The author plans to be tactful, which is important. The issue is whether excluding someone based on their partner's behavior is justified. \n\nIn many social contexts, it's acceptable to adjust group norms, especially if there's consensus. The problem arises if the approach is harsh or unfair. The author's intention is to communicate the group's discomfort and suggest an alternative. Since the group is unanimous and the author is seeking a respectful solution, this seems reasonable. \n\nAlso, considering the personal discomfort caused by the girlfriend's actions, especially the intrusive behavior towards the author's identity, it adds weight to their need to address it. The author isn't acting out of spite but to preserve the group's enjoyment and their own well-being. \n\nPotential counterarguments might suggest that the group should handle this as a group rather than one person taking action. However, the scenario states that the group has discussed it and the author is representing the group's consensus. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the situation in a thoughtful manner to protect the group's dynamic and their own comfort.\n"
