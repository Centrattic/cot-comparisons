It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night anymore. The original question is about whether the person (the author) is right to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night, and the friend's girlfriend has been coming for the last four times. The author and others find her annoying\u2014she's self-centered, interrupts others, talks over people, and makes the author uncomfortable with her behavior. Additionally, the author is gay and doesn't want to be stereotyped by her touchy-feely behavior. They've all talked about it and don't like her, but don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be honest and tell the friend that the group dynamic has changed and make it guys-only.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for planning to tell the friend this?\n\nFrom my perspective, the key points are whether the author has a right to exclude someone from a group activity, especially when the group collectively agrees. The group is composed of five friends, and the girlfriend is only invited because the friend brings her. The group has already discussed their discomfort and the author is planning to communicate this respectfully. The main issue is whether it's wrong to exclude someone based on their behavior, even if that person is a partner of a group member.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, sometimes groups need to set boundaries, especially if the presence of another person is affecting the comfort and enjoyment of the majority. The author is trying to address the problem directly and respectfully. However, there might be a consideration about how the message is delivered. The author plans to be nice, which is a good approach. \n\nBut is it wrong? The author isn't being malicious; they're addressing a real issue that affects the group. The girlfriend's behavior is causing discomfort, and the group has a right to maintain their environment. The author's actions are aimed at preserving the group's dynamic and their own well-being. So, in this context, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). They are acting in the interest of the group's comfort and their own.\n"
