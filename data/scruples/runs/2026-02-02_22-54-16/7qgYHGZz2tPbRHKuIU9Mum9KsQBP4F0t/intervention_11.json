It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nThe author and their friends have a monthly game night. One friend's girlfriend has been coming for the past four times, and this is causing issues. The main problems are that the girlfriend is very self-centered, interrupts others, and makes the author uncomfortable by trying to push her gay stereotype on him. The author is considering telling the friend that the group wants her to not come anymore, making it a guys-only event.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The group includes five friends, and only the friend's girlfriend is the problem. The author mentions that the rest of the group has talked about it and agrees they don't like her there. They just don't know how to tell the friend. The author is thinking of being direct but nice about it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to have this conversation? Well, the group is the one that's affected. The girlfriend's presence is making the game night unpleasant for everyone except her boyfriend. The author is trying to address this by communicating their discomfort. However, the way they approach it matters. They plan to be nice and suggest a different gathering for the couple. \n\nPotential issues here: The author is being honest about their group's feelings. The friend's girlfriend is not their main concern, but the group's dynamic is. The author is not confronting the girlfriend directly but talking to the boyfriend. So maybe the approach is appropriate.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way? Like, the group could have discussed it privately among themselves first, or perhaps they could try a different approach. However, the author is not doing anything malicious. The main point is that the group is not enjoying the game night, so they have a right to express that. \n\nThe author's reasoning seems valid. They're not being cruel, just honest. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
