It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a group of friends who don't want the friend's girlfriend to come to game nights anymore. The author wants to tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend there.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has a monthly game night with five friends. The friend's girlfriend has joined the last four times, but she's making the group uncomfortable. She's described as attention-seeking, talkative, interrupting others, and even making the author, who is gay, uncomfortable by trying to engage in \"girl talk\" and being touchy-feely. The author and others have talked about it, but the friend's girlfriend isn't getting their hints. The author wants to confront the friend directly but in a nice way.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI should consider a few factors. First, the group's right to set boundaries. Friends can choose to have events without certain people if they're making others uncomfortable. The author's friend might not be aware of how the girlfriend is affecting the group, so the author is trying to communicate that. The girlfriend's behavior is causing discomfort, so it's reasonable for the group to want her to not come. The author is planning to approach the friend respectfully, not just excluding the girlfriend without his knowledge. That's important because it's about communication rather than a backdoor approach.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The friend is in a relationship, so the author needs to be careful not to alienate him. The approach the author is considering is direct but kind. It's about changing the group dynamic, not attacking the girlfriend. The other friends are on board, so it's a group decision, not just the author's.\n\nPotential issues could be if the author is being too harsh or if the friend might feel betrayed. But given the context, the author's intention is to preserve the group's dynamics. The girlfriend's actions are making the game night unpleasant for everyone except the boyfriend. The author is trying to address it tactfully. \n\nAnother angle: the author is being honest rather than letting the situation continue. The group has already discussed it, so they're not acting alone. The method of approaching the friend is respectful. The answer might lean towards B (not wrong) because the group has a right to set boundaries, and the approach is considered kind. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way? Like suggesting the boyfriend can bring the girlfriend but the group will adjust their behavior? But the problem is the girlfriend's behavior is uninvited and disruptive. The author tried to be tactful but it didn't work. The friend might not know his girlfriend's behavior is an issue. So, the author's approach is necessary to communicate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to maintain a social group where everyone is comfortable. The answer should be B.\n"
