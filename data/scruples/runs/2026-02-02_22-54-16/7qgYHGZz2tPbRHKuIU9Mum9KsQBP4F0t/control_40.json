It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a group of friends who have game nights, and one of their friend's girlfriend keeps coming. The author and the group find her annoying because she's always dominant in conversations, interrupts others, and there's also some personal discomfort because the author is gay and the girlfriend's behavior makes him uncomfortable. The author wants to tell their friend that the group doesn't want the girlfriend to come anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group's main issue is that the girlfriend is making the game nights unpleasant for everyone except her boyfriend. They've discussed it and agree they don't like her, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly but in a nice way, suggesting making it a guys-only night and maybe having a different gathering for the couple.\n\nIs it right for the author to confront the friend about this? Well, the group has discussed it, so it's a shared concern. The problem is the girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group's enjoyment, so the group has a valid reason to want to change the dynamic. However, the way they go about it matters. The author wants to be nice and straightforward, which is important to avoid causing unnecessary hurt. \n\nBut here's a catch: the girlfriend is the partner of a friend, so the group's approach needs to be sensitive. The author mentions that they've tried to be tactful, but the girlfriend isn't getting the hint. The key point is that the group's gatherings are supposed to be for the five of them, and the girlfriend's presence has changed the dynamic in a way that's not enjoyable. The author's intention is to restore the original group dynamic.\n\nI should also consider whether the group has given the girlfriend a chance to improve her behavior. The author says they tried being tactful, but the girlfriend keeps doing the same things. Since the group has already tried and the problem persists, maybe it's reasonable to address it directly. \n\nAnother angle is the personal discomfort related to the author's sexuality. The girlfriend's touchy-feely behavior and trying to make him into a gay best friend type is making him uncomfortable. This is a personal boundary issue. The group's right to have a space where everyone feels comfortable is valid, so excluding someone who is causing discomfort could be justified.\n\nHowever, there's a potential for the author to be in the wrong if they don't approach the situation carefully. For example, if the friend feels betrayed or if the approach isn't respectful, that could damage the friendship. The author's plan is to be nice and explain that the group dynamic has changed, which seems reasonable. The key is whether the author's method is considerate and whether the group's right to control their social space outweighs the girlfriend's inclusion.\n\nIn summary, the group has a legitimate reason to want to exclude the girlfriend since her presence is making the gatherings unpleasant for everyone. The author's approach seems thoughtful, aiming to maintain the friendship while addressing the issue. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
