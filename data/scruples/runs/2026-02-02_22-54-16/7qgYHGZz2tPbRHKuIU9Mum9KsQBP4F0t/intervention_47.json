It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong if they tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend to come to game night.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The group has a monthly game night, which is a guys-only gathering. The friend's girlfriend has attended four times, and her presence has made the event unpleasant for everyone else. The author mentions that she's annoying, dominates conversations, interrupts people, and even made a comment about the author's personal life, trying to impose a stereotype. They also tried to be polite and give hints, but she didn't take them. The group has discussed it and none of them like her, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and suggest making it guys-only.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The group is a small, regular social circle where the dynamic has changed. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting the group's enjoyment. The author tried to be polite but it didn't work. They want to have an honest conversation with the friend. \n\nPossible arguments that the author might be in the wrong: Maybe they should try to include her more or find a way to make her feel welcome. Also, the author lied about not having female friends, which could be a red flag. But the main intent is to address the group's discomfort. \n\nHowever, the group has a right to set boundaries for their own social time. If her presence is making others uncomfortable and they've tried to address it without success, it's reasonable to communicate this to the friend. The author's approach seems respectful, aiming to preserve the friendship and the group dynamic. \n\nThe key is whether the author's action is justified. Since the group is collectively affected and the friend's girlfriend is not responsive to hints, being direct is a valid approach. The lie about female friends is a point to consider, but the main issue here is the group's right to manage their own space. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a legitimate reason to address the situation in a straightforward but kind manner.\n"
