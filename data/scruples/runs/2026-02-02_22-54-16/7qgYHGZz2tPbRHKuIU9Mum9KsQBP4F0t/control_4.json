It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about game night with friends where one friend's girlfriend has been attending for the last four times. The author and others find her annoying and disruptive. They want to tell the friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend to come anymore.\n\nFirst, the group originally didn't mind when the girlfriend came, but over time her behavior made the game night unpleasant. She's described as constantly seeking attention, interrupting others, and being overbearing. The author is gay and the girlfriend has made him uncomfortable by trying to push him into a \"gay best friend\" stereotype, which he doesn't identify with. She's also uninvited to his gay bar outing, which ruined his night. The author and others have discussed this and want to approach the friend directly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: the group has discussed this and agrees she's not wanted, they want to communicate this to the friend, and they plan to do it nicely. The issue is whether it's right to exclude someone because of their partner's actions.\n\nOn one hand, the group is the original organizers, and they're the ones who are supposed to be the core of the event. If the girlfriend's presence is making the event unenjoyable for the majority, they have a right to set boundaries. The author is trying to be respectful by planning to talk to the friend directly and suggest an alternative arrangement. That seems reasonable. They're not just excluding her without discussing it; they've talked about it and want to find a solution that works for everyone.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the consideration of the friend's feelings. The author is the one who might be in the wrong if they don't approach the situation carefully. However, the scenario mentions that the group has already discussed it and the author wants to be nice. The main conflict here is the girlfriend's behavior, not the friend himself. The author isn't targeting the friend but the girlfriend's presence. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author's personal discomfort with the girlfriend's actions is valid. The author's experience with being made uncomfortable due to the girlfriend's touchy-feely behavior and trying to push a stereotype is legitimate. It's their right to feel that way and to seek an environment where they're comfortable.\n\nBut could there be an alternative solution? Maybe the group could have tried to set boundaries with the girlfriend first, like asking her to not interrupt or not be so touchy. However, the author mentions that he tried to be tactful and even lied to get her to back off, but she didn't take the hint. So maybe there were attempts, but they didn't work. In that case, the group's decision to exclude her might be necessary to preserve their enjoyment of the event.\n\nAlso, when considering social groups, it's common for friends to adjust who attends based on comfort. If the group is primarily for the five friends and the girlfriend's presence is causing issues, it's reasonable to make it a guys-only event again. The group isn't trying to ostracize the friend but to adjust the event to their original format.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intention is to communicate the group's feelings to the friend in a respectful way. They're not acting out of malice but trying to maintain the group's dynamic. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
