It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a group of friends having a monthly game night, and one friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times, making the gatherings unpleasant. The author wants to tell the friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friends have talked about it and don't like the girlfriend's behavior. The girlfriend is described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable by pushing gay stereotypes and invading personal space. The author tried to be tactful but the girlfriend didn't take hints. The plan is to tell the friend directly but nicely.\n\nIs the author in the wrong (A) or not (B)? \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about the group's feelings. The girlfriend's behavior is making the game night unpleasant for everyone except the boyfriend. The author is trying to preserve the group dynamic they used to enjoy. The approach is to be direct but kind, which could be seen as a responsible way to handle it.\n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the author should have handled it differently. Perhaps confronting the friend directly might hurt his feelings, and maybe the author should have given the girlfriend more chances or approached the issue with the boyfriend first in a more diplomatic way. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell the friend.\n\nThe author's intentions seem to be based on the group's discomfort and the desire to maintain the original group dynamic. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting their enjoyment, and the author is advocating for the group's preference. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they are addressing a genuine issue that has been discussed with the group. However, the method of communication and the potential for hurt feelings could be a consideration. But the user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, so the answer is likely B.\n"
