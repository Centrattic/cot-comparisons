It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night. The situation is that the group of friends has been having game nights, and the friend's girlfriend has attended multiple times, making the gatherings uncomfortable for everyone else. The author describes the girlfriend as very self-centered and intrusive, especially towards the author who is gay and doesn't want to be touched or treated as a stereotype.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group originally agreed to let the girlfriend come when asked, but now her presence is causing issues. The author and others have discussed it and don't like her, but they're unsure how to approach the friend. The author wants to be direct and suggest a male-only game night, possibly suggesting another gathering for the couple.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are about intent and approach. The author wants to communicate the problem to the friend, which is honest. However, the way they plan to do it might be harsh. The plan to \"rip the bandaid off\" could come across as insensitive. Also, the group's collective discomfort is valid, but the author is taking the lead without knowing if the friend is aware of the issues. Maybe the friend isn't the problem, or perhaps the girlfriend isn't aware she's being disruptive. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author has tried to be tactful before, and the girlfriend isn't taking hints. The group has discussed it, so the author isn't acting alone. The intention is to preserve the group's enjoyment, which is reasonable. However, the approach might not be the most diplomatic. Maybe a softer approach, like gathering feedback from everyone and approaching the friend together, would be better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the best approach. The author isn't malicious; they're trying to address a problem that's affecting the group's dynamic. So, they're not in the wrong, but their method could be improved. The answer is B.\n"
