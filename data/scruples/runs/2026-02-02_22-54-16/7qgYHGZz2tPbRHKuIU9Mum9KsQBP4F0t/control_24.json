It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group of friends has a monthly game night, which used to be a highlight. The friend's girlfriend has joined the last four times, and her presence is making the gatherings unpleasant. She's described as annoying, interrupting others, being self-centered, and making a gay member of the group uncomfortable with touchy-feely behavior and trying to force him into a \"gay best friend\" stereotype. The group doesn't like her and wants to tell the friend, but they're unsure how. The author is considering being direct.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The group's right to enjoy their time is a factor. If the girlfriend's behavior is genuinely making the event uncomfortable for everyone else, then the group has a valid reason to want her not to attend. However, the way they handle it matters. The author wants to be polite, suggesting a group-only night and maybe another time for the couple. That seems reasonable.\n\nBut there are considerations. The author is using a friend's relationship to exclude someone. The friend might feel blindsided or betrayed. Also, the author mentions that they've talked about it among themselves. Is it fair to exclude someone without the friend's consent? However, since the group is the one initiating the change, and if the friend's girlfriend is making it unenjoyable, the group does have the right to set boundaries. The key here is whether the group is communicating in a respectful way. The proposed approach is to explain that the dynamic has changed and suggest alternative plans. That seems fair.\n\nAnother point is the author's personal experience being affected by the girlfriend's behavior. The author is gay, and the girlfriend is trying to force a \"girl talk\" dynamic, which the author finds uncomfortable. This is a valid concern because it's about personal boundaries and respect. The author has already tried to be tactful but without success. So there's a legitimate reason for the group to act.\n\nPotential issues: The group might be excluding someone based on her behavior, which is acceptable if it's affecting the group's enjoyment. However, if the group is doing this without the friend knowing, that could be problematic. But the author's plan is to talk to the friend directly and respectfully, which is better than excluding secretly. \n\nIs there a bias or personal dislike here? The author mentions that the group \"just don't like her,\" but also gives specific examples of her behavior that cause issues. It's not just personal dislike but problematic actions. So the group's actions are in self-defense to protect their social environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a real issue that affects the group's experience. They're approaching it in a respectful way, considering the friend's relationship by suggesting alternative plans. The right answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
