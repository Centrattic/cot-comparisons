It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who don't want the girlfriend to come to their game night anymore, but they're struggling to tell their friend. The author wants to confront him directly. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The group has had monthly game nights, which they used to enjoy. The friend's girlfriend has been coming for four times now. The problem is that she's really annoying, centers conversations on herself, interrupts others, and is pushy. Plus, she's making the author uncomfortable by trying to make him act gay in a way he doesn't want to. The group has discussed it and all agree they don't like her presence, so they want to tell the friend his girlfriend shouldn't come. The author plans to be direct but polite, suggesting a guys-only night and maybe a separate couple's gathering.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The group's game night is a social event they've been having for a while. The girlfriend's behavior is making it unpleasant for the group. They've tried being tactful, but the girlfriend isn't getting the hint. The author's approach is to have a conversation with the friend to address the group's discomfort. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are standing up for the group's preferences. The problem is that the girlfriend's presence is ruining their experience. The author is trying to communicate this in a respectful way. However, there's a potential for hurting the friend's feelings, and maybe the girlfriend's as well. But the group has a right to enjoy their own events as they see fit. Also, the author's personal discomfort due to the girlfriend's inappropriate behavior (trying to make him act a stereotype) is a valid reason. \n\nBut could there be a better way to handle it? Maybe. But the question isn't about the best approach, but whether the author is in the wrong. Since the group is trying to be polite and the situation is affecting their enjoyment, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate issue that the group has faced and have tried to handle tactfully. So the answer is B.\n"
