It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell his friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. The situation is that the group of friends has monthly game nights, which used to be enjoyable, but the friend's girlfriend has been coming and making it unpleasant. She's described as annoying, talkative, interrupts others, and is making the author uncomfortable, especially since he's gay and she's trying to force a \"girl talk\" dynamic on him. The group has discussed it and wants to tell the friend that the dynamic has changed to guys-only.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. The author is part of a close-knit group that's been meeting regularly. When the friend first asked if his girlfriend could join, they didn't mind, but now it's been four times and things have gotten worse. The key points are that the group is unanimous in their dislike of her presence, and they want to address it. The author plans to be direct but polite, suggesting a guys-only night and a different gathering for the couple.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the group is the one setting the boundaries for their own event. If the girlfriend's presence is causing discomfort to multiple people, it's reasonable for the group to adjust their rules. However, the way they go about it matters. The author wants to be nice and explain that the dynamic has changed. They're not being malicious; they're trying to preserve their social time. The girlfriend's behavior is clearly problematic, so it's not just about disliking her, but her actions making the event unpleasant. The author isn't attacking the friend's relationship but setting a boundary for their own social group. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The author mentions lying, like saying he doesn't have female friends. That could be seen as manipulative. Also, the way the girlfriend is described might be biased. Maybe there's a chance she's not as bad as perceived, but given the consistent complaints from all members, it's likely not just the author's perspective. \n\nIn social groups, it's important to communicate boundaries. The author's approach is to be honest but kind. Since the group is united, it's their right to decide who attends their gatherings. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
