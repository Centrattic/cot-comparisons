It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is part of a group of five friends who have a monthly game night. It used to be their favorite thing. But now, one friend's girlfriend has been coming along for four times, and she's making the nights unpleasant. The group all agrees they don't like her there, but they're trying to decide how to tell her boyfriend. The author wants to be direct and tell him that the group dynamic has changed and they want it to be guys-only, maybe suggesting a different night for the couple.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The girlfriend is described as annoying, dominating conversations, interrupting others, and being touchy-feely with the author, who is gay but not the \"gay best friend\" type she's trying to mold him into. The author even went so far as to lie about not having female friends. The group is all in agreement that they don't want her there, and the author is considering a straightforward approach.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is part of a social group that has established a tradition. The problem arises when the girlfriend's presence disrupts that tradition. The friends have discussed it and all agree they don't like her, but they're hesitant to approach the boyfriend. The author is advocating for being honest but kind.\n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, sometimes groups do prefer to have certain traditions without partners, especially if they're close-knit and the partner's behavior is affecting group cohesion. However, the way the author plans to approach it matters. They mention being nice and suggesting a separate night for the couple, which is a respectful approach. However, the author's lie about not having female friends is a bit of a red flag. Lying might not be the best way to handle things, but the intent here was to set boundaries, which is understandable.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's behavior. If she's being overbearing and making the group uncomfortable, it's reasonable to ask her to not attend. The group is inclusive in that they're all friends, but adding someone who changes the dynamic negatively can be grounds for adjustment. The key issue is whether the author is justified in wanting to exclude her, even if it means telling the friend.\n\nBut wait, is the author actually in the wrong for wanting to exclude her? Well, the author is part of the group, and the group's consensus is that they don't want her there. The author is not acting alone but is following the group's sentiment. The main concern is how to communicate this to the friend. The author's approach is direct but polite. However, the lie might be a problem. But in the context of trying to be tactful, maybe the group is justified in using a kind way to set boundaries.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions are making the game nights unpleasant. The author is trying to protect the group's social space and their enjoyment. The fact that the group has discussed it and all agree suggests that this isn't just the author's personal issue but a collective one. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address it. The issue is more about the method. But the method proposed is respectful, even if the lie is a bit of a stretch.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong because they are part of a group that wants to maintain their social dynamic, and they're approaching the situation with the intention of being respectful. The lie is a minor misstep, but the main action of wanting to exclude the girlfriend due to her negative impact on the group is reasonable.\n"
