It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about game night with friends, and one friend's girlfriend has been coming along, making the group uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's group of friends used to have game nights where they'd hang out, play games, and catch up. The friend's girlfriend has been coming the last four times, and she's causing issues. She's described as annoying, self-centered, interrupting others, and even making the author uncomfortable by stereotyping him as a \"gay best friend\" and invading his personal space. The author mentions that the rest of the group also doesn't like her but hasn't told the friend yet. The author wants to approach the friend directly and suggest making game night guys-only.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. So the question is whether it's wrong for the author to tell the friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend to come anymore.\n\nI should consider a few angles. First, the right to social gatherings: friends have the right to set boundaries about who they include in their group activities. If the group is meant to be for them, they can decide who attends. The girlfriend's behavior is disruptive, affecting the group's enjoyment. The author has tried being polite (like lying about having no female friends), but it's not working. The key here is whether it's reasonable to exclude someone from a social group they weren't part of originally.\n\nAnother angle is the approach. The author plans to be polite, suggest a guys-only night, and maybe have a separate get-together for the couple. That seems reasonable. However, the friend's girlfriend didn't ask to be excluded; the author is taking initiative to set boundaries. But the group's right to their own time and comfort is important.\n\nBut is there a wrong in being honest? The author isn't being cruel, just setting boundaries. The problem is the girlfriend's behavior, not the fact that she's there. So, the author is acting in the group's interest. The alternative is letting the situation continue, which is causing discomfort. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address it.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have approached it differently, like talking to the friend first instead of just telling him. But the scenario says they've all talked about it and want to act. Also, the author is being direct but polite. The key is the intent to maintain the group's dynamic, which is valid. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
