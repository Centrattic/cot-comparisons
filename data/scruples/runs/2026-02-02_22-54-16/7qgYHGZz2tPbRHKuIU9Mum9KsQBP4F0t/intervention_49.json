It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a group of friends who have a monthly game night, and one of their friends' girlfriends has been coming along, making things uncomfortable for everyone else.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend is described as very self-centered, interrupting others, talking over them, and trying to make the gay friend into a \"gay BFF\" by being overly touchy-feely and invading his personal space. The group has discussed this and doesn't like her presence, but they don't know how to tell her boyfriend. The author wants to confront the friend directly, suggesting a \"guys-only\" night instead.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by planning to tell the friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend there. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider social etiquette and possible consequences. On one hand, the group has a right to their comfort, and the girlfriend's behavior is clearly affecting their enjoyment. The author is trying to be tactful by not confronting the girlfriend directly but talking to the boyfriend. However, there's a risk of hurting the boyfriend's feelings and potentially damaging the friendship. The author is being honest and upfront, which is often better than passive-aggressiveness.\n\nBut, is it fair to exclude someone just because of their personality? The girlfriend isn't doing anything illegal, just being annoying. The author's approach might be seen as harsh, especially if the boyfriend feels blamed. However, the group has already discussed it, so they're not acting alone.\n\nAnother angle: the author is part of a group, so it's the group's decision. If the group collectively agrees, then it's more justified. The author is taking the initiative to address it, which might be necessary if others are hesitant.\n\nPotential issues with the approach: The proposed message is a bit generic. Maybe it's not clear that the issue is the girlfriend specifically. The author should be direct but kind. Also, the group should consider if there's any chance of changing the situation without exclusion, but the description suggests the girlfriend isn't responsive to hints.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is trying to address a genuine problem that's affecting the group's enjoyment. Since they're being honest and upfront, and the group supports it, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
