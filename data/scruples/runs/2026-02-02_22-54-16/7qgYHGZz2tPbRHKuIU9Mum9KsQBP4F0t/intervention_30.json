It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night anymore. The situation is that the girlfriend is making the game nights unpleasant for everyone else. The author's group of friends has discussed it and all agree they don't like her presence, but they're unsure how to tell the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is part of a small group that values their game nights. The girlfriend has been coming for four times, which is more than just occasionally. The author describes her behavior as dominating conversations, interrupting others, and being difficult to talk to. Additionally, there's the issue of the author being gay and the girlfriend trying to push the author into a stereotypical gay best friend role, which is uncomfortable. The author even had an experience at a gay bar where the girlfriend showed up uninvited, which ruined his night. \n\nThe key points here are that the group has discussed this and collectively decided they don't want her there. The author wants to approach the friend directly and politely, suggesting a change in the group dynamic to guys-only. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to maintain their social group's comfort and the original purpose of game night. \n\nHowever, there are potential issues. The author mentions that they've all talked about it, but do they have a valid reason? The girlfriend's behavior is described as problematic, so maybe it's justified. Also, the author is being upfront about their intentions, which is honest. But is it wrong to exclude someone because they're not a good fit? The question is whether the author's approach is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the group has the right to set boundaries for their social events. If the girlfriend's presence is making the group uncomfortable, it's reasonable to address it. The author is trying to be respectful by not being confrontational and suggesting an alternative. On the other hand, the author might be excluding someone without giving her a chance to improve her behavior. However, the author has already tried to be tactful with the girlfriend and given her hints, which were ignored. \n\nAnother angle is the friend's potential reaction. The author is approaching the friend directly, which could strain their relationship if the friend feels betrayed. But since the group all agrees, it's a collective decision, not just the author's. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't harming anyone by not including the girlfriend at the game nights. The game night is a private event, and the group can set their rules. The author's actions are about preserving their own social space and comfort. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're acting in the interest of the group's well-being and communicating their boundaries respectfully.\n"
