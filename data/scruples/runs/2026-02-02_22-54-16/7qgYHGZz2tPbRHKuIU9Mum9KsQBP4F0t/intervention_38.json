It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell a friend that his girlfriend isn't wanted at game night. The scenario is that the group of friends has a monthly game night, which used to be fun but has become unpleasant since the friend's girlfriend started joining. The girlfriend is described as dominating conversations, interrupting, and making the author uncomfortable because of her behavior towards them. The author wants to be upfront with the friend to make game night guys-only again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group collectively dislikes the girlfriend's presence, not just the author. They've all talked about it. The key question is whether it's wrong for the author to approach the friend directly. \n\nThe author's intention is to protect the group's dynamic and enjoyment. The problem is that the girlfriend's behavior is making the events unenjoyable for everyone except the boyfriend. The author is trying to communicate this in a respectful way, as stated by their plan to be nice. The alternative would be for the group to continue pretending and not address the issue, which might lead to ongoing discomfort.\n\nThere's a potential conflict in relationships here. The author is close enough to the friend to have game nights but needs to navigate not wanting to hurt the friend by rejecting his girlfriend. The approach is to frame it as a group decision and suggest an alternative way to spend time as a couple. That seems considerate. However, the author is aware that the friend might take it personally, but the group's well-being is a valid concern.\n\nIs it the author's place to do this? Since all the friends agree, and the author is taking the initiative to communicate directly, it might be necessary. Avoiding the conversation could lead to resentment or continued awkwardness. The author is trying to be honest and maintain the group's dynamic, which is important for everyone involved. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a shared problem respectfully.\n"
