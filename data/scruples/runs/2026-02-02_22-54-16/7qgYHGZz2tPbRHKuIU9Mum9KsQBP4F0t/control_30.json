It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend at game night. The situation is that the girlfriend is being disruptive, interrupting conversations, being the center of attention, and making the author uncomfortable because of her behavior towards him, considering he's gay but not the \"gay best friend\" type. The group has discussed it and doesn't like her, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct and suggest making it a guys-only night.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The key points here are the girlfriend's behavior causing discomfort and the group's consensus. The author is trying to address an issue that affects their social environment. They're not being malicious but aiming to restore the group's dynamic. The question is whether they have a right to set boundaries, especially when the current situation is affecting their well-being and the group's enjoyment.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions include being overbearing, interrupting others, and making personal boundaries an issue for the author. The group's desire to exclude her is not based on her gender but her behavior. The author is considering a tactful approach, being nice but direct. It's important to consider if the group should have addressed this earlier but now they're trying to find a solution. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have handled it differently, like talking to the friend privately first or finding a more subtle way. However, the friend might not have noticed the issue since his girlfriend is his partner. The group's right to social boundaries is valid. If the girlfriend's presence is genuinely making the gatherings unpleasant for everyone except the friend, then the group has a right to set those boundaries. \n\nThe author's approach of being honest but kind seems reasonable. They're not attacking the friend but explaining the group dynamic change. The answer might hinge on whether the group is being fair in their assessment. Since the group has discussed it and agrees, it's a collective decision. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for the group's preference. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
