It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about game night with friends, and one friend's girlfriend is making it unpleasant. The author wants to tell the friend that the group doesn't want the girlfriend there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The group has talked about it and all agree they don't like her presence. The girlfriend is described as attention-seeking, interrupting others, and making the author uncomfortable with her behavior. The author is considering a direct approach, being nice but clear about making it a guys-only night.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the group is within their rights to set boundaries for their social gatherings. They've already discussed it, so there's consensus. The issue is how to communicate it to the friend. The author plans to be tactful, which is important. The problem might be if the approach is confrontational, but the plan is to take the friend for a beer and explain gently. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning for excluding the girlfriend is based on her behavior, which could be justified. But they need to consider that the friend might take it personally. The key here is that the group isn't acting out of malice but to preserve their own enjoyment. It's a sensitive situation, but if done respectfully, it's not necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the group has the right to set their own rules for their time together. The author isn't being malicious, just trying to maintain a group dynamic that works for everyone involved. The main thing is that they're approaching it in a considerate way, which is important. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
