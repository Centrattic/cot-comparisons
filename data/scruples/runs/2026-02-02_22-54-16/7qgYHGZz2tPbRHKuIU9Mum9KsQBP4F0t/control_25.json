It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a group of friends who have a monthly game night. One of their friends' girlfriend has been coming along the last four times, making the experience unpleasant for everyone else except the boyfriend. The author wants to tell the boyfriend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend there anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group originally agreed when the girlfriend was invited, but now her behavior is causing problems. She's described as dominating conversations, interrupting, talking over others, and making the author uncomfortable with her behavior related to his sexuality. The other friends have all talked about it and agree they don't like her presence.\n\nThe author is considering being direct with the boyfriend. The main question is whether this is wrong. Let's break down the factors:\n\n1. **Respect and Boundaries**: The group has a right to set boundaries about their social gatherings. If the girlfriend's presence is making the event unenjoyable for everyone except the boyfriend, the group might need to address it. However, the method of communication is important. The author plans to be nice but direct, which could be seen as respectful.\n\n2. **Honesty vs. Kindness**: The author is concerned about being tactful, which shows they care about the friend's feelings. But they also feel the need to address the issue. The challenge is to communicate the problem without being cruel. The proposed message is about changing the group dynamic, which seems reasonable if the presence of the girlfriend is indeed causing issues.\n\n3. **Potential for Miscommunication**: The boyfriend might feel betrayed if the group didn't communicate this before. The author mentions that they've tried to be tactful but the girlfriend didn't get the hint. However, maybe they should have addressed the issue with the girlfriend first, but since she's not part of the group, the responsibility lies with the boyfriend.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it fair to exclude someone based on their behavior? If the girlfriend's actions are genuinely making the group uncomfortable, then it's reasonable to set boundaries. However, the group should ensure that their criticism is based on her behavior rather than personal dislike.\n\n5. **Impact on Friendships**: The author is worried about hurting the boyfriend's feelings. But if the game night is a shared activity, the group's comfort should be a priority. The boyfriend might need to adjust the event to accommodate everyone's preferences.\n\n6. **Alternative Solutions**: Maybe the group could suggest a different format, like having a couples-friendly night occasionally, but the author wants it to be guys-only. If the group is unanimous in this decision, then the approach is justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're addressing a genuine issue affecting their social group. The key is whether the approach is respectful and direct. The answer would likely be B (No) because the group has the right to set boundaries and improve their social experience, especially when the presence of another person is causing consistent problems.\n"
