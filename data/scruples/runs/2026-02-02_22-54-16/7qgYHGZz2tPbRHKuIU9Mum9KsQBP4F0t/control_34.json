It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night. \n\nFirst, the situation: The group has a monthly game night, which used to be fun. The friend's girlfriend has been coming the last four times and is making it unpleasant. She's described as centering attention on herself, interrupting others, talking over them, and making the gay author feel uncomfortable with stereotypes and unwanted touchiness. The author and others don't like her presence but don't know how to tell the friend. The plan is to be direct but nice, suggesting a guys-only night and maybe a different time for the couple.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author is part of a group that's collectively uncomfortable with her presence. They've discussed it and agree. The issue is whether the author is justified in approaching the friend. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is problematic, affecting the group's enjoyment. The author is being respectful by planning to communicate this privately and kindly. However, there's a potential issue with how the friend might take it. The author is trying to be tactful, which is good. The plan is to frame it as the group dynamic changing, not just the girlfriend's behavior. That's a reasonable approach to avoid blaming the individual.\n\nBut wait, is the author overstepping? The girlfriend's boyfriend is the one who initially invited her, so maybe the group should have addressed the issue earlier. However, the group did try to be tactful and it didn't work. The author is acting in the group's best interest to maintain their social time. The problem is that the girlfriend's actions are making the game night unenjoyable for everyone else. \n\nAnother angle: The author is being direct, which could be seen as honest communication. The plan is to be respectful and find an alternative. So, the author isn't being malicious. The girlfriend's behavior is causing harm to the group's enjoyment, so the author's actions are about maintaining their social space. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way? Like the group could have tried to talk to the girlfriend first, but the author mentions that they tried to be tactful and it didn't work. The author is now taking the initiative to address it with the boyfriend. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if the group is collectively unhappy and the author is acting in a respectful manner, then the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the author's approach is too harsh or not considering the friend's feelings enough, maybe A. But the plan is to be nice and frame it as a group dynamic issue, which is a standard approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a real issue that affects the group's enjoyment. The answer is B.\n"
