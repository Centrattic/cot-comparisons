It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his friend that no one wants his girlfriend to come to game night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend's girlfriend has been attending game nights for the past four times. She's described as annoying, always trying to be the center of attention, interrupting others, and even making the author uncomfortable by invading personal space and stereotyping. The rest of the group also doesn't like her but hasn't confronted the friend yet. The author wants to be direct.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, respect, and communication. The group initially agreed to the girlfriend coming once, but now it's become a monthly occurrence. The problem is that the girlfriend's behavior is making the game nights unpleasant for everyone except her boyfriend. The author is considering telling the friend to exclude her, but the question is whether that's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author and his friends have the right to enjoy their social time without discomfort. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting their experience. On the other hand, they need to communicate this respectfully. The author is planning to have a private conversation with the friend, which is a good approach. However, is it their place to dictate who the friend brings? The friend might feel blindsided or think his partner is being targeted. \n\nBut considering that the group has already discussed this and everyone is involved, it's a group decision. The author is just the one taking the initiative to approach the friend. The way they plan to phrase it (\"group dynamic has changed\") is a common way to address social changes without blaming the person directly. \n\nIs there a better way? Maybe suggesting a couples night instead, but the group prefers guys-only now. The author's intention is to protect the group's comfort, which is valid. However, the approach should be sensitive. The author is not attacking the girlfriend personally but addressing the group dynamic. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The author is being honest and direct, which is sometimes necessary. But if they don't address it, the problem continues. The girlfriend isn't getting the hint, so maybe the group's passive approach isn't working. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue, especially since the group is affected. The method of being direct but polite is appropriate. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
