It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends who usually have a monthly game night, but one friend's girlfriend has been coming along and making it unpleasant for everyone else.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is part of a group that's been meeting regularly. The girlfriend has attended four times, and her behavior is causing issues. She's described as very attention-seeking, interrupting others, and being loud. Additionally, she's making the author uncomfortable by trying to impose stereotypes about being a \"gay BFF,\" which he doesn't identify with. The author and others have discussed not liking her presence but don't know how to tell their friend. The author is considering a direct approach to end the game night as a mixed group and make it guys-only.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the possible angles. On one hand, the author is trying to communicate a problem that's affecting the group dynamic, which is a valid concern. They're also sharing personal discomfort, which is important to address. However, there's a nuance here. The author is part of a group that's collectively upset, so they're not just speaking out of nowhere. They've discussed it and are looking for a solution.\n\nBut wait, the author is specifically suggesting to tell the friend that the group wants to keep it guys-only. That might come off as excluding the girlfriend, which could be seen as rude or judgmental. However, the author is in a position where they feel their comfort and the group's enjoyment are compromised. The girlfriend's behavior is causing problems, and the author is trying to address it in a way that preserves the friendship while changing the dynamic. The author also mentions being direct but nice, which could help in maintaining a good relationship with their buddy.\n\nAnother point is the author's personal experience as a gay person being mischaracterized. The girlfriend's actions here are not just about the group's enjoyment but also about the author's personal boundaries and identity. This is a significant factor because it's about respect and how the group handles sensitive issues. The author has tried to be tactful, even lying to set boundaries, which indicates they've been trying to handle it delicately but to no avail.\n\nThe group's collective decision might be valid, but the way it's communicated is crucial. The author is considering a private conversation with their friend, which is often the best approach when dealing with sensitive issues. However, there's a risk that the friend might feel betrayed if the girlfriend is excluded. But since the group has already discussed this and the girlfriend's presence is causing genuine discomfort, the author's intention is to protect the group's dynamics and their personal well-being.\n\nIs there a right or wrong way here? It's a tricky social situation. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to solve a problem that's been ignored despite their attempts. The key is whether their approach is respectful and considers their friend's feelings. The suggested message seems reasonable, focusing on the group dynamic rather than attacking the girlfriend directly. \n\nBut maybe the author could have found a different solution first, like talking to the girlfriend directly or suggesting activities that are more inclusive. However, the scenario states that the others have already talked about it and the author is the one advocating for a direct approach. The group's consensus is that they don't want her there, so the author isn't just acting on their own.\n\nI should also consider if the author's reasoning justifies the action. The girlfriend's behavior is affecting everyone, not just the author. The group's comfort is a legitimate reason to request a change. The author's personal issue is an added layer, but it's part of the overall problem. \n\nIn social groups, it's common for dynamics to change when new people join. If the girlfriend's presence is making the game nights less enjoyable for the majority, the group has the right to address it. The author is trying to communicate that in a way that's fair and maintains the friendship. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a proactive step to resolve a problem that's been discussed and affecting the group's experience, while also addressing personal discomfort. However, the way they phrase it could be important. Using a group decision and being honest but kind is the right approach here.\n"
