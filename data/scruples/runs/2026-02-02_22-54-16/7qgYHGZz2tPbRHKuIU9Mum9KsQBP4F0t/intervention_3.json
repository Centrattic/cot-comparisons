It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend to come to game night. So the situation is that the group has monthly game nights, which used to be fun but have become unpleasant since the friend's girlfriend started attending. She's described as annoying, dominating conversations, interrupting others, and even making personal comments about the author's sexuality. The author mentions that the group has talked about it and agrees they don't like her, but they're unsure how to tell the friend. The author wants to approach the friend directly and suggest making it a guys-only night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is justified in their actions. The key points here are the impact of the girlfriend's behavior on the group's enjoyment. The author states that she's made the gatherings \"completely unenjoyable\" due to her behavior. They also mention specific instances like interrupting others, being loud, and inappropriate interactions based on the author's sexual orientation. It seems like the group has a consensus, not just the author's personal dislike. \n\nHowever, there's a potential issue here. Telling someone that their partner isn't wanted can be hurtful. The author plans to be nice and suggest an alternative, but the friend might feel betrayed or that their relationship is being criticized. The question is whether the author has a right to prioritize the group's enjoyment over the friend's relationship dynamics. Also, the author's personal experience of being targeted by the girlfriend adds to the justification, as they felt uncomfortable and had to lie to set boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's autonomy. The author is making a group decision without the friend's input. The friend might have wanted to include his girlfriend in the group's social activities, so excluding her without discussion could be seen as overstepping. But the group has already discussed it and agrees, so maybe it's a collective decision. \n\nThe author's approach is to be direct but polite, which is a reasonable method for such a sensitive topic. However, the act of excluding someone from a social group, even if it's justified by behavior, can be seen as harsh. The question is whether the author's actions are within bounds of friendship and group dynamics or if they're being inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of moral rightness, if the girlfriend's presence is genuinely ruining the group's experience and they've tried to be polite without success, the author might be justified. But there's a risk of alienating the friend. The author is trying to find a middle ground by suggesting an alternative meeting for the couple. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would hinge on whether the group's right to enjoy their own gatherings is more important than the friend's desire to include his girlfriend. Since the group has a consensus and the author is acting on behalf of the group's well-being, it's more likely that the author isn't in the wrong. However, the approach should be as tactful as possible, which the author is attempting.\n"
