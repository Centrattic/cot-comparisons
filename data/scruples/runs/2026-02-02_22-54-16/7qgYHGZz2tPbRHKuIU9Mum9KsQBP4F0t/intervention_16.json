It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend isn't welcome at game night.\n\nFirst, the situation: They have a monthly game night with five friends, usually guys. The friend's girlfriend has been coming the last four times, making the group uncomfortable. She's described as annoying, dominating conversations, and even making personal issues for the author, like trying to push him into a \"gay best friend\" stereotype despite him not wanting that. The group all agrees they don't like her there but don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be straightforward and suggest making it a guys-only night.\n\nSo, the key points here are that the group is uncomfortable, the girlfriend is causing problems, and they want to address it directly. The author's approach is to be polite but honest, not confrontational. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFrom what I read, the group has tried being tactful before without success. The girlfriend isn't taking hints, and the author's plan is to communicate the issue in a way that's respectful. It's their social time, and they have the right to set boundaries. However, there's a risk of damaging the friendship if the friend takes it the wrong way. But the author is planning to be nice, so maybe that's the right approach. Also, the friend is the one who originally asked if she could come, so the group was okay with it initially, but things escalated. Now, since the dynamic is ruined, it's reasonable to address it. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to preserve the group's enjoyment. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
