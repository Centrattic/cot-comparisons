It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong if they tell their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group of friends has monthly game nights, which used to be fun. The friend's girlfriend has been coming the last four times, and she's causing problems. She's described as annoying, self-centered, and even making things awkward for the gay person in the group. The author is considering telling the friend that the group doesn't want her there anymore.\n\nThe key points here are the reasons why the group dislikes her. She's being disruptive, not letting others talk, and making the author uncomfortable with her behavior. The author also mentions that others in the group feel the same but don't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be direct but in a nice way.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main ethical question is whether it's justified to exclude someone from a social gathering due to her behavior. The group is trying to maintain their original dynamic, which was important to them. The girlfriend's actions are affecting everyone's enjoyment, so the group has a valid reason to want her out.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. The author is considering directly confronting the friend. The approach might be harsh if not done carefully. But the author plans to be nice and suggest an alternative, which could be seen as considerate. The group's right to enjoy their own event is important. They have the right to set boundaries with their friends, especially if the girlfriend's presence is causing harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel betrayed if the author goes straight to him without a group discussion. But the scenario states that all the group members agree, so it's a collective decision. The author is just the one stepping up to communicate it. The girlfriend's behavior is objectively problematic, so the group's decision to exclude her isn't just about personal dislike but about the environment they want to maintain.\n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone's presence is making others uncomfortable and ruining the event, it's reasonable to address it. The author isn't just excluding her for no reason; there are specific, repeated behaviors that justify the action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to correct the situation to preserve the group's enjoyment and comfort.\n"
