It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their friend that no one wants his girlfriend at game night. \n\nFirst, the situation: The group has monthly game nights, which were once a highlight for the author. The friend's girlfriend has been attending the last four times and is making the gatherings unpleasant. She's described as very self-centered, interrupting others, not interesting, and even making the author uncomfortable with her behavior, especially towards him as a gay person. The group all agrees they don't like her presence but don't know how to approach the friend. The author wants to confront the friend directly but in a nice way.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the group's feelings are valid. They've tried being tactful, but she's unresponsive to their hints. Her behavior is causing discomfort and ruining the experience for everyone. The author's intention is to address the issue directly but politely, which might be necessary if the friend isn't aware of the problem. The group's dynamic has changed, and they want to preserve their social time. The author's approach seems measured, as they plan to be nice and suggest an alternative (a couple's night). \n\nOn the other hand, the author is about to tell a friend that his girlfriend isn't welcome, which could strain the friendship. The friend might feel betrayed, and the author is speaking on behalf of the entire group. There's a risk of causing hurt feelings or damaging the friend's relationship. However, the author is trying to communicate the group's collective sentiment, not just their own. They've already discussed it among themselves, so it's a group decision.\n\nThe key points here are the impact of her presence on the group's enjoyment and the author's approach. The author isn't being malicious; they're addressing a real problem that the group has. They're also planning to be considerate, suggesting an alternative. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have handled it differently, like having the friend talk to his girlfriend himself. But the friend might not realize the issue if they don't know. The author is the one directly affected by her behavior (as a gay person), so they have a personal reason to want her to stop. \n\nI think the author is trying to solve a problem that the group has collectively identified. They're not just acting unilaterally but representing the group's feelings. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're addressing a real issue that's affecting their social gatherings and making an effort to communicate it respectfully.\n"
