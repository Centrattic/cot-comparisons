It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is part of a group of friends who have a monthly game night. One friend's girlfriend has been joining them the last four times, and the group (except the boyfriend) has grown to dislike her. The author is considering telling the friend that the group doesn't want his girlfriend to come anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the social dynamics here. The group originally agreed to let the girlfriend come, but now her presence is making the game nights unpleasant. The author and others have talked about this, and they all agree they don't like her. The author wants to confront the friend directly but in a nice way, suggesting a \"guys only\" night and maybe a different gathering for the couple.\n\nIs it wrong for the author to speak up? Well, the group has a shared experience of discomfort. If they don't communicate their feelings, the problem will persist. The author is trying to address the issue to restore the enjoyment of the game nights. However, the method of confrontation could be a factor. The author plans to be nice and straightforward, which is generally a good approach. The key question is whether the author is justified in communicating the group's feelings to the friend, even if it might hurt his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior is problematic. She's being inconsiderate and making others uncomfortable. The author is part of a group that's been affected, so it's reasonable for them to want to address the situation. The author's approach is to suggest a solution (guys-only night and separate plans with the couple), which is fair. The main issue is whether the group has the right to exclude someone based on the group's comfort. Since the game night was originally a male group activity, it's reasonable to want it back as a male-only event. The author isn't targeting the girlfriend personally beyond the group's discomfort, so it's not just about disliking her but about maintaining the group dynamic.\n\nHowever, there's a risk of being blunt and potentially damaging the friendship. The author could consider a more diplomatic approach, maybe discussing it as a group first to present a united front. But the intention is to be polite and find a compromise. The key point is that the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to communicate the group's feelings honestly, especially since the situation is affecting everyone's enjoyment. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
