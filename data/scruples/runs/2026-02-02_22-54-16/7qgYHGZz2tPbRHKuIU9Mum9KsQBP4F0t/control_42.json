It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night. The situation is that the girlfriend is making the game nights unpleasant for the group. The author wants to confront their friend directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group of friends has been having monthly game nights, which were happy events until the girlfriend started attending. The author and others are uncomfortable with her behavior\u2014she's dominating conversations, interrupting, and making the author, who is gay, uncomfortable with her touchy-feely interactions. The group has talked about it, and they all agree they don't like her there but don't know how to tell their friend.\n\nThe author wants to approach their friend directly and suggest making game night guys-only. The question is if this makes the author wrong. \n\nI should think about if the author's intentions are justified. They're trying to preserve the group's enjoyment and are being direct but polite. However, there might be a better way to handle it. Maybe they should approach the friend without being confrontational, or perhaps find a compromise. But the key here is that the group is genuinely affected, not just one person. The author isn't targeting the girlfriend personally but is addressing the impact on the group. \n\nHowever, there's a potential for the message to be delivered in a hurtful way. If the friend feels like the group is rejecting his girlfriend, it could strain their friendship. The author wants to be nice, but the way it's framed could be seen as excluding the girlfriend. Also, the author's friend might not be aware of the specific issues, so just saying the group dynamic has changed might not give the full picture. \n\nBut considering the group's consensus and the girlfriend's behavior, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to address it. It's important to maintain friendships and group dynamics. The problem might be more about how they communicate it rather than the decision itself. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong, but they should consider a more tactful approach.\n"
