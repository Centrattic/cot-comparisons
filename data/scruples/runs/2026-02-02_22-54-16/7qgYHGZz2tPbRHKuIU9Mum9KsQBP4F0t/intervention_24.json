It\u2019s mostly just the five of us getting drunk, playing cards or board games, and catching up.   It\u2019s probably sad, but it used to be the highlight of my month.  \n\nOne of my friends has a girlfriend who for the last four times has tagged along.  None of us minded when he first asked if she could come, but she\u2019s made these get together completely un enjoyable.  \n\nShe\u2019s nice enough I guess, but she\u2019s insanely annoying.   She always has to be the center of attention.  She talks about herself and her opinion almost nonstop and she\u2019s really not that interesting so it doesn\u2019t make for good conversation.  If someone is talking, she will interrupt and find a way to bring it back to her.  If the person keeps talking she will just talk over them.  I\u2019ve sat there and watched her do it and raise her voice on purpose just to be louder than the person talking.  \n\nAnother thing that\u2019s been awkward for me personally is that she tries to make me a stereotype.  I\u2019m gay.  I\u2019m not the \u201cgay bff\u201d type of guy though.  Yet she keeps trying to make me into hers.  She\u2019s always getting weirdly touchy feely with me.  She tries to have \u201cgirl talk\u201d with me.  One time she learned that I was going out to a gay bar and shows up uninvited and basically followed me around and ruined my entire night.   I\u2019ve tried to be tactful with her since she\u2019s my buddy\u2019s girl, but she does not get the hint.  One time I went so far as to tell her that I don\u2019t have any female friends because I just really only get along with guys (lie), but in one ear and out the other.  \n\nNo one except her boyfriend wants her there.   The rest of us have all talked about it.  None of us like her.   We just don\u2019t know how to tell him.  I\u2019m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy and just want to take him out for a beer and tell him.  I would be nice about it.  I already know the gist of what I would say.  \u201cThe group dynamic has just changed with a girl in the mix.  We\u2019d like to make it a guys only night and maybe get together with you guys as a couple a different night. \u201c.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to tell their friend that his girlfriend shouldn't come to game night anymore. The scenario is that the group of friends has a monthly game night, and the friend's girlfriend has been attending the last four times. The author and others find her annoying and disruptive, making the game night unpleasant. She's talkative, interrupts others, and the author is a gay man who doesn't want to engage in \"girl talk\" or have her touchy-feely behavior. The group has discussed it but doesn't know how to tell the friend. The author wants to be straightforward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is part of a close-knit group where the dynamic has changed. The girlfriend's presence is causing discomfort for the group. The author's personal experience is compounded by the girlfriend's behavior, including the incident at the gay bar, which is particularly offensive. The group has all agreed that they don't want her there.\n\nBut is it right to exclude someone? The author's intention is to restore the original group dynamic. However, the girlfriend isn't part of the group, so the group might have the right to set boundaries. On the other hand, the friend might feel that his partner should be included. The challenge is to communicate this without burning bridges. The author is considering a direct approach, which could be seen as honest but potentially hurtful. However, if the group is unanimous and the friend is open to understanding, maybe it's necessary. The alternative is to let the group continue to be unhappy, which isn't fair either.\n\nAnother angle: the author is being honest about their discomfort, which is valid. They've tried to be tactful but the girlfriend isn't getting the hint. The problem is the impact on the group's enjoyment. Since the group has discussed it and agrees, the author isn't acting alone. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
