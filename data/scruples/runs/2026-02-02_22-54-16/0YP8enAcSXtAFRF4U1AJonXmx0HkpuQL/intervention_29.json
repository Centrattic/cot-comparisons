Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reacting the way they did when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The author was high on weed, which they mention is normal at their house. They replied with a comment about the aunt's age and their health insurance, then said they were too high for the conversation. Their grandma walked away, and they feel bad about the way they reacted.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the appropriateness of the author's reaction. The family is asking for a significant and life-altering decision\u2014organ donation. The author was not in a clear state of mind when this was brought up, which complicates things. Their response was direct but maybe not the most considerate. However, the request itself is extremely heavy, and the author is not obligated to donate a kidney. \n\nThe author's defense is that they were under the influence and not in the right frame of mind for such a serious conversation. They also mention that they don't have a close relationship with the great-aunt. The monetary compensation adds another layer, which might imply that the family is looking for a financial solution rather than purely altruistic reasons, which could be a point of contention.\n\nThe author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own insurance, which are valid concerns but perhaps not the best way to handle a sensitive topic. However, given the context of being under the influence and the sudden nature of the request, their reaction might be more about shock and discomfort than malice. The grandma walking away and the mom's silence suggest that the conversation was taken the wrong way, but the root issue is the family's approach in bringing up such a serious matter in a social setting, especially when the author wasn't prepared or in the right mental state.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing donation, but the way they communicated their refusal might be seen as insensitive. However, considering the circumstances\u2014being high, the suddenness of the request, and the lack of prior close relationship\u2014their reaction is more about being unprepared than being disrespectful. The family might be at fault for not approaching the topic with more care and sensitivity, especially in a family event setting. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have points. The key is that the author's reaction was in response to an unexpected, serious request under the influence, and their concerns about health insurance and personal health are valid. The family's approach was also problematic, possibly expecting an immediate decision without proper consideration of the author's state and feelings.\n"
