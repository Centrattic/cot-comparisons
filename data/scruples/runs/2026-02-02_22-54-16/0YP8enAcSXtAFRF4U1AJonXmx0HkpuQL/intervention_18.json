Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author was at a family party, tipsy and had just used weed. Their grandma brought up the topic of donating a kidney to the great-aunt. The author was clearly not in the right state for such a serious conversation. Their reaction was to question the age of the great-aunt and their own health insurance issues, then mention they're too high to discuss it. The mom and grandma were upset and didn't talk to them for the rest of the night.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was under the influence, the request was sudden and serious, and the family members were asking for a major life decision. The author's response was honest about their state and concerns. Now, is the author in the wrong for reacting that way?\n\nWell, donating a kidney is a huge decision. It's not something that should be discussed when someone is impaired. The author was upfront about their impairment and their inability to engage in a serious conversation. They also expressed valid concerns about their health insurance, which is a practical issue. The family members should have considered the author's state before bringing up such a topic. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have been more diplomatic in their response. Instead of making a joke about the great-aunt's age, perhaps they could have said they need time to think or were too impaired to discuss. But given the situation, the author's reaction seems reasonable. They didn't commit to anything and made it clear they weren't in the right frame of mind. The family's expectation to have this conversation in a party setting while the author was under the influence sets a problematic precedent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were honest about their state and expressed their concerns. The family should have approached the topic more sensitively. The answer should be B.\n"
