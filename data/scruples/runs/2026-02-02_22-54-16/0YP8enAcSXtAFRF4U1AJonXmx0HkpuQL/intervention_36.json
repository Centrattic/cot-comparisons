Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for how they reacted to being asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The situation is described in a Reddit-style AITA (Am I the Asshole?) format.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was at a family party, tipsy and had used weed. The conversation came up about donating a kidney to a great-aunt they don't know well. The grandma suggested it, and the author responded with shock, questioned the aunt's age, mentioned their insurance issues, and said they were too high to discuss it. The mom and grandma then stopped talking to them for the rest of the night.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're the asshole for reacting that way, even though they don't want to donate the kidney. The user already thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, the main factors here are consent, mental state during the conversation, family dynamics, and the offer of money. The author was under the influence of both alcohol and weed, which might have impaired their ability to engage in a serious discussion. They also mentioned their own health insurance concerns, which is a valid point because donating a kidney can have long-term health risks and costs.\n\nThe family's approach seems to have caught the author off-guard. The grandma brought it up without prior discussion, and the author's reaction was to question the situation, which is reasonable. The author isn't obligated to donate an organ, and the fact that they were under the influence complicates the situation further. The offer of $25,000 might also raise ethical questions about organ donation for money, though that's more a legal/medical ethics issue.\n\nThe author's response, while perhaps blunt, is a legitimate expression of their discomfort and concerns. They didn't outright refuse in a hurtful way but instead questioned the premise. The family's immediate reaction to stop talking to them suggests they were upset, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The key here is whether the author's reaction was inappropriate given the circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's state of mind (tipsy and high) and the sudden, serious nature of the request likely contributed to their reaction. They are under no obligation to donate, and expressing hesitation is reasonable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
