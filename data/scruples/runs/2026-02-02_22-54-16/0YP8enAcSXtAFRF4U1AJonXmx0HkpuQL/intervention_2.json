Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked to donate a kidney. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was at a party, tipsy and had just smoked weed. Their mom and grandma brought up the topic of donating a kidney to a great-aunt who's in her late 70s. The author made a comment about the aunt being old and worried about their insurance, and also said they were too high to discuss it. Then their grandma walked away, and they weren't talked to for the rest of the night.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The author was in a compromised state (drugged and under the influence), so their reaction might have been less than optimal. But donating a kidney is a huge decision. It's a major surgery with long-term health implications. The author is 26, so they might not have a close relationship with this great-aunt. The financial incentive of $25k is mentioned, which could be a factor in the family's suggestion, but the author is concerned about their insurance and potential debt if complications arise.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the family is suggesting a life-changing medical procedure in a social setting where the author was not in a clear-headed state. The author's response was somewhat hesitant and maybe a bit dismissive, but given the situation, it's understandable to be taken aback. The grandma's reaction of walking away suggests that the author's comment about the aunt's age was offensive or hurtful. However, the author's main points about their insurance and being too high are valid concerns. The decision to donate an organ should be made carefully, without pressure, and with full understanding. Being under the influence isn't the best time to discuss this.\n\nThe family might be placing an unfair expectation on the author to consider such a significant act, especially if the great-aunt isn't a close part of their life. The author's right to make their own medical decisions is important here. Even if the response was blunt, the underlying reasons for not wanting to do it are legitimate. The author's self-awareness of being high and not wanting to discuss it in that state shows they recognized their own inability to engage properly.\n\nSo, the author's response may not have been the most tactful, but the situation itself is problematic. The family broached a heavy topic inappropriately when the author was not in the right mindset. The author had the right to express concerns about their health and financial implications. The grandma's reaction was harsh, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not being able to handle the conversation then. Organ donation is a serious matter, and the way the family approached it seems hasty and possibly insensitive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They had valid reasons and the context of being under the influence and the topic being introduced in a social setting without prior discussion are key factors.\n"
