Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about the author being asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they were tipsy and had just taken a dab of weed. That's a key point. Being under the influence might affect judgment and how someone reacts. But does that automatically make the reaction wrong? Maybe not necessarily. People can still express their feelings even if they're not 100% sober.\n\nThe grandma brings up the kidney donation out of the blue. The author responds with \"isn't she kind of old?\" which is probably a flippant comment given the context. The mom responds defensively, and the author points out their insurance issues and that they're too high. Then grandma walks away.\n\nThe author feels bad about how they reacted but not about the decision to not donate. The question is if the reaction was wrong. \n\nIn terms of the response, the author's first comment about the aunt's age might have been a joke or a dismissive comment. The main issue here is the appropriateness of the reaction. The user is asking if the author is wrong for the way they reacted, not for refusing to donate. \n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as dismissive or unkind, especially since the request was made by family. However, the context of being under the influence might mitigate some responsibility. Also, the financial aspect and health insurance concerns are valid real-life factors. But the way they expressed those concerns was perhaps not the most respectful, especially in front of others and during a family gathering.\n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at whether the person's response was proportionate. The author didn't outright refuse but made a sarcastic comment. The mom and grandma taking offense is understandable. The author might not be the asshole for not donating, but their reaction could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the offer of $25k also raises questions about the family's motivations, suggesting that the request might be more about financial compensation than altruism, which the author could reasonably be skeptical about.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the context of being under the influence, the suddenness of the request, the author's valid concerns, and the possible insincerity of the family's offer, the reaction might be justified. The answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
