Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The key points here are the context of the conversation, the author's state of mind, and the family's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, so they were not in a clear state of mind. The request came up suddenly during a casual conversation. The author's response was to question the great-aunt's age and mention their insurance issues, then mentioned being high. The family members, especially the grandma, were upset and stopped talking to the author for the rest of the night.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are consent and the appropriateness of the request. The author clearly states they don't want to donate a kidney, which is their right. They have a valid concern about their health insurance and the financial risks. The family offered money, but that could be seen as a bribe, which might complicate things ethically. \n\nThe author's reaction, while perhaps abrupt, was in response to a serious and unexpected request. Being under the influence might have affected their ability to handle the conversation, but it's also a fact that the request was made in a social setting where the author was already relaxed. The grandma's reaction (walking away) seems harsh. The author wasn't in the right frame of mind to discuss such a major decision, so their response was honest about their state and concerns.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author is not obligated to donate a kidney. The family's approach might be more at fault for bringing up such a serious request in a casual, possibly inappropriate setting. The author's response, while not perfect, was a truthful expression of their unwillingness and inability to consider the request properly at that time. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
