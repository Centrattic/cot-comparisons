Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The situation is that the author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had just smoked weed. The grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney, and the author responded with some comments that made their mom and grandma upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. Their state of mind wasn't the best for a serious discussion. The family is asking for a significant personal sacrifice\u2014organ donation\u2014which is a huge decision. The author's response included a comment about the aunt's age and their own insurance concerns, which might have come off as dismissive or insensitive.\n\nBut wait, the author's main point is that they were not in the right state of mind. They also mentioned that they were shocked and didn't mean to be rude. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about the reaction but isn't regretful about refusing to donate.\n\nNow, considering medical ethics, no one should be pressured into donating an organ. The family is asking for a significant personal sacrifice, and the author has the right to say no. However, the way they expressed refusal might have been inappropriate. The comment about age could be seen as ageist or heartless, even if the author was under the influence. Also, the author's mention of their insurance issues shows they're considering practical consequences, which is valid, but the initial reaction might have been poorly handled.\n\nThe grandma's reaction of walking away suggests she felt disrespected. The author's response, while honest, could have been more empathetic. They might have needed to express their refusal politely while acknowledging the family's hopes, even if they were under the influence. The fact that they were high doesn't absolve them of the responsibility to be considerate in their response.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's refusal is understandable and they're not wrong for saying no. However, the manner in which they refused, especially the tone and the comment about age, might have been hurtful. They could have handled the conversation better, but the core issue is that they were not in a good mental state for the discussion. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the refusal is their right, but they could improve their communication. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for the reaction. Since they were under the influence and the main problem is the way they reacted, maybe they are not the asshole. But some might argue that the way they reacted was inconsiderate regardless of their state. Hmm.\n"
