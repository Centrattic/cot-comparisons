Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about donating a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy from weed, when her mom and grandma suggested she should get tested to donate a kidney for the aunt. The author responded with shock, questioning the aunt's age and her insurance situation, and mentioned she was too high to talk. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about how she reacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was under the influence both from alcohol and weed, which might have impaired her judgment. The request to donate a kidney is a serious medical decision, and bringing it up in a social setting like a party without prior discussion seems inappropriate. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and her own financial concerns, which are valid reasons to be hesitant. However, the way she reacted\u2014suddenly being asked in a not-serious conversation and being under the influence\u2014could have made the conversation more stressful.\n\nThe family's approach might be part of the issue. Asking someone to consider a major surgery without proper context or support is a lot to ask, especially in a family gathering where the person is not in the right frame of mind. The author's response, while maybe blunt, was probably due to the unexpected nature of the request and her state at the time. It's important to note that donating a kidney is a personal choice and not an obligation, even within family. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to do it, but the way she reacted might have been hurtful to her grandma, hence her feeling like the asshole.\n\nOn the other hand, the grandma walking away suggests that the author's response was indeed upsetting. However, the initial approach by the family might have been tactless. The author's main points about her insurance and being under the influence are valid concerns. She's not morally obligated to donate, and her reaction, while perhaps not the best in terms of delivery, stems from valid reasons and the inappropriate timing of the request.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The family's handling of the situation was problematic, and the author's response was influenced by being in an unsuitable state for such a serious conversation. Her concerns about health insurance and her readiness to discuss such a major decision are reasonable, and the family should have approached the topic more carefully and respectfully.\n"
