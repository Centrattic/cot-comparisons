Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a family member, which is a significant and personal decision.\n\nFirst, the author was under the influence of alcohol and marijuana when the conversation happened. That's a key point because being in a compromised state might affect their ability to engage in a serious discussion. The request to donate a kidney is a major life decision, and the author's initial reaction was to question the aunt's age and their own insurance. The author also mentioned they were too high to have the conversation, which is a valid reaction given their state.\n\nThe mother and grandmother reacted negatively, not talking to the author for the rest of the night. The author is conflicted, feeling that they didn't want to donate but are worried about their tone. They also mention receiving an offer of $25,000, which might be a financial incentive, but donating a kidney should be a voluntary decision without coercion.\n\nThe author's response was direct and honest about their feelings and current state. While the manner of the question was abrupt, the author wasn't confrontational but rather expressed their discomfort. The family's reaction seems harsh, especially the grandmother walking away. The author isn't obligated to donate an organ, and their response was within their rights to express their unwillingness. The fact that they later reflected on their reaction shows self-awareness, but the initial response was appropriate given the circumstances. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
