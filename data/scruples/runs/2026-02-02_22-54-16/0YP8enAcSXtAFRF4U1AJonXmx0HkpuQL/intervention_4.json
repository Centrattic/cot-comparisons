Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked for a kidney donation. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, a 26-year-old woman, was at a family party when her mom and grandma brought up the idea of her donating a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was under the influence of both alcohol and weed, which might have affected her ability to engage in a serious conversation. Her initial reaction was to question the aunt's age and mention her own health insurance concerns. The grandma then walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't speak to her for the rest of the night. The author is conflicted about whether she handled it correctly.\n\nThe key points to consider here are: the context of the conversation (casual party, not a private or appropriate setting), the author's state at the time (intoxicated), the nature of the request (kidney donation is a major medical decision), and the relationship with the great-aunt (not close). \n\nKidney donation is a significant decision involving health risks, recovery time, and potential long-term effects. It's not something that should be decided impulsively or in a social setting, especially while under the influence. The fact that the family is offering $25,000 might also raise questions about the appropriateness of the request\u2014organ donation is typically not a financial transaction, and offering money could pressure someone into a decision they're not comfortable with.\n\nThe author's reaction was to express hesitation and mention her current state and insurance concerns. While her tone might have been blunt, given the circumstances, it's understandable. She's not obligated to donate an organ, even to family, especially someone not close. The way she responded might not have been the most tactful, but given her state and the inappropriate context, it's not necessarily wrong.\n\nThe family's reaction (grandma walking away and not speaking to her) seems harsh. They brought up a serious topic in an inconsiderate setting. The author's right to refuse is clear, and the way she expressed her concerns, while maybe not diplomatically, is a valid response. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author didn't outright refuse but instead asked a question about the aunt's age could be seen as a way to navigate the conversation without immediately committing to a decision. Her mention of health insurance issues highlights a legitimate concern that's often overlooked in such requests.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she's not obligated to donate, the conversation was in a poor setting, and her response was a legitimate expression of her concerns. The family brought up the topic inappropriately, and the author's reaction, while perhaps not the most graceful, is justified given the circumstances.\n"
