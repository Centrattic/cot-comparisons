Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after reacting to their family's request to donate a kidney. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was at a party, tipsy and had smoked weed. Their mom and grandma asked her to consider donating a kidney to a great-aunt, offering $25k. The author's response was a bit flippant, asking if the aunt is \"kind of old,\" and then mentioning her health insurance and being high. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about how she reacted.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nDonating a kidney is a major decision. The author is not obligated to do it. The initial reaction seems to be a bit dismissive, but she's under the influence of substances, which might affect her judgment. Also, the payment offered for a kidney donation is something to note\u2014since in many places, selling a kidney is illegal. The family offering money could be problematic, but the question is about the author's reaction.\n\nThe author's response was to make a joke about the aunt's age and mention her insurance and being high. That might come off as disrespectful or flippant, especially in front of family. However, she did express valid concerns about her health insurance and the situation. Being under the influence might explain her tone, but not necessarily her responsibility. \n\nThe grandma walked away, indicating hurt feelings. The author is questioning if she was in the wrong for the reaction, not the decision itself. The key here is whether her manner of response was inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author isn't wrong for refusing to donate, the way she reacted might have been tactless. However, considering she was under the influence, maybe she's not fully at fault. But the main issue is about her reaction's tone and timing. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because she had the right to decline, and the family's approach was sudden and in a social setting where she was not in a good state to have a serious conversation. The payment might also be a red flag, but that's more about the family. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the best, isn't making her the asshole for standing up for her own boundaries.\n"
