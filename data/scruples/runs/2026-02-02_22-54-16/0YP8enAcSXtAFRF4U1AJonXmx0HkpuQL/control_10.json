Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. \n\nFirst, the context: The author was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, and was caught off guard by the request. They responded with a comment about the aunt's age and their own insurance issues, which upset their family.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are: \n\n1. **The Author's State of Mind**: They were tipsy and had just used weed. This might have affected their ability to handle the conversation appropriately. However, being under the influence doesn't excuse poor reactions, but it can explain them.\n\n2. **The Nature of the Request**: Donating a kidney is a major decision. The author didn't know the great-aunt well, so the sudden request might feel intrusive. The financial incentive (25k) adds pressure, but the author refused, which is their right.\n\n3. **The Author's Response**: The comment about the aunt's age (\"isn't she kind of old?\") could come off as dismissive or insensitive. However, the author was clearly flustered and under the influence. Their mom's response about the aunt living to 100 shows the family's desire for her to live longer, but the author's concern about their own health insurance is valid. \n\n4. **Family Reactions**: The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night. The author feels they upset their grandma. But was their reaction unkind? The author stood their ground on a personal decision.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they had the right to decline the donation. Their response was honest, even if blunt. The question is whether their delivery was inappropriate. The initial comment about age might have been a bit tactless, but given the context (impaired state, surprise request), it's understandable. The author also pointed out their own health risks, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to say no, and their response, while perhaps not perfectly phrased, was honest about their feelings and circumstances.\n"
