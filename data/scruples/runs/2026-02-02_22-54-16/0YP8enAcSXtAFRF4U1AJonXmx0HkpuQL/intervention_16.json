Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted to their family's request to donate a kidney. The situation involves the author being asked under the influence of alcohol and weed, which affects their mental state.\n\nFirst, the family approached the author in a social setting, which might not be the best time. The author was not in a clear state, which could lead to an impulsive reaction. The grandma just suddenly suggested the kidney donation, and the author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own insurance. The mom and grandma then left the conversation, and the author feels guilty about the way they reacted, even though they stand by the decision not to donate.\n\nThe author's defense is that they don't have a close relationship with the aunt, their health insurance is bad, and they were under the influence. The family offered $25k, which might imply they want the author to accept for financial reasons, not just altruism. The author's reaction, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was honest about their feelings and concerns. \n\nThe key points here are the context of the situation (under the influence, not a close relationship), the financial aspect, and the appropriateness of the family bringing up such a serious decision in a casual setting. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing, and their reaction, while perhaps not the smoothest, is understandable given the circumstances. The family's approach might be more at fault for not considering the author's state and readiness to discuss such a major decision.\n"
