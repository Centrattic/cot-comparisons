Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted to their family's request to donate a kidney. The situation involves a family party where the author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when their mom and grandma asked them to consider a kidney donation for their great-aunt. The author responded with hesitation, mentioned their insurance issues, and said they were too high for the conversation. The mom and grandma were upset and didn't talk to them the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The author was not in a sober state when the conversation happened, which might have affected their judgment and response. They were tipsy and had just smoked weed. That's a key point because being under the influence can lead to less thoughtful reactions. However, the main issue here is whether their reaction was inappropriate.\n\nThe author's response was to question the age of the great-aunt and their own financial concerns. They didn't outright refuse but expressed reservations. Then they mentioned they were too high for the conversation, which might have been a way to disengage. The grandmother walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did respond in a way that might have been seen as dismissive or uncooperative. However, the request to donate a kidney is a huge decision, and the author is within their rights to refuse or express hesitation. The fact that they were under the influence complicates things because it's not the best time for serious discussions. Also, the family offered money, which can be a red flag. The author's concerns about health insurance and financial burden are valid. \n\nThe author might feel guilty about the way they reacted, but considering the circumstances (intoxicated, unexpected request, valid concerns), maybe it's not their fault. The family bringing up such a heavy topic during a party, especially when the person is not in the right state, could be seen as inappropriate. The author's response was honest about their current state and their hesitations. The family's reaction of cutting off communication seems over the top. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were in a compromised state and had legitimate reasons to be hesitant. The family's approach to making such a request in that context might be the bigger issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
