Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt, and they reacted poorly, partly because they were under the influence of alcohol and weed. They said something like \"isn't she kind of old?\" and mentioned their insurance issues, then their grandma walked away and they didn't talk to them for the rest of the party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was tipsy and had just smoked weed, which isn't the best state for a serious conversation. The family brought up this request suddenly, which could be a lot to process. The author was shocked and made a joke about the aunt's age, which might have been inappropriate. The grandma took it as an offense and left, leading to tension.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the request to donate a kidney is a huge decision. The author isn't obligated to do it, especially since their relationship with the aunt isn't close. The way they reacted might have been unkind, but given the context of being under the influence, maybe it's understandable. However, the grandma might have felt dismissed or offended by the comment about age. The author could have handled it more respectfully, even if they were high. \n\nOn the other hand, the family brought up such a serious topic in a social setting, maybe without considering the author's state or preparedness. The offer of money complicates things too\u2014organ donation for money can be ethical issues, but that's not the main point here.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for refusing to donate, but their reaction might have been rude. However, considering the circumstances (being high, the sudden request), it's debatable. The grandma's reaction was also harsh. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they can't be expected to handle a serious conversation while under the influence, and the family might have approached the topic inconsiderately. So the answer is B.\n"
