Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted to being asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had used weed before the conversation. Their mom and grandma approached them and suggested a kidney donation to their great-aunt, offering $25k. The author was shocked and responded with comments about the aunt's age and their own health insurance, plus mentioned they were too high to discuss it. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about the reaction.\n\nFirst, the author's immediate reaction: they were under the influence of substances, which might have affected their ability to handle a serious conversation. They asked a question about the aunt's age, which could be seen as insensitive, but maybe it's just a genuine concern. Then they raised valid points about their own financial situation and the inappropriateness of the timing due to being high.\n\nThe grandma getting upset and walking away is a result of the conversation. The author is now questioning if their reaction was wrong. The key points here are the context of being under the influence, the sudden and serious nature of the request, and the lack of prior meaningful relationship with the great-aunt.\n\nIn terms of ethics, donating a kidney is a major decision. The author is not obligated to do so, especially given the circumstances. Their response, while maybe not perfectly phrased, seems to express legitimate concerns. The grandma's reaction might be more about the emotional impact rather than the content of the response. \n\nThe author's main issue is feeling they upset their family. However, considering the context, it's understandable they were caught off guard and in an inappropriate state for such a discussion. The offer of money could also be a point of contention, as paid organ donation is ethically complex and not legal in many places.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's response was in a compromised state, they raised valid concerns, and the request itself might be problematic. Therefore, they're not in the wrong.\n"
