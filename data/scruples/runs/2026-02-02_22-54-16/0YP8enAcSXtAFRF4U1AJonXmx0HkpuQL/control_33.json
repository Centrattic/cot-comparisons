Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and they reacted in a way that upset their mom and grandma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, which might have impaired their judgment. They were approached by their mom and grandma about kidney donation. The author responded with a comment about the aunt's age and their own health insurance concerns, and mentioned they were too high for the conversation. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about how they reacted.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Kidney donation is a big decision, and it's a personal choice. The author is not obligated to do it, especially since their relationship with the great-aunt isn't close. However, the way they responded might be an issue. They were under the influence, which could have affected their ability to handle a serious conversation. Making a joke about the aunt's age, even if it was a nervous reaction, might have been hurtful. Also, the author's main concern about their own health insurance is valid, but bringing up being high might have come off as dismissive.\n\nBut on the other hand, the family approached them in a social setting, possibly catching them off guard. The offer of $25k could be seen as a financial incentive, which might complicate the decision, as organ donation should ideally be altruistic. However, the author's right to refuse is absolute. The family's expectations might not have been realistic, especially given the author's state of mind and the circumstances.\n\nThe author's main mistake might be the tone and the specific comment about age, which could be seen as insensitive. However, the overall situation is complex. The author isn't wrong for refusing but might have handled the conversation poorly. The emotional response of the grandma and mom could be due to the unexpected nature of the request and the author's reaction under the influence. So, while the author isn't in the wrong for refusing, their manner of response might have been inconsiderate, making them partially at fault. But according to the options given (A or B), the answer would depend on whether the author is entirely in the wrong. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide. The author's refusal isn't wrong, but the reaction might be. However, in the context of the AITA format, often the person isn't considered the asshole for making a personal choice even if the reaction was flawed. So maybe the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
