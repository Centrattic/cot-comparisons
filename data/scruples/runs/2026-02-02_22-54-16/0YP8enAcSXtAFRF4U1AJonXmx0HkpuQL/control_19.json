Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction when asked to donate a kidney. \n\nFirst, the author was in a social setting, tipsy, and had just used weed. Their grandma introduced the topic unexpectedly, asking her to donate a kidney with a $25k offer. The author's response was a bit flippant, asking if the great-aunt is \"kind of old,\" which might come off as dismissive or insensitive. They also mentioned their insurance issues and being too high to discuss it, which could be seen as not taking the situation seriously.\n\nThe mom and grandma were upset and didn't talk to her for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about their reaction but is firm in not wanting to donate. \n\nNow, considering the context: the request was sudden and in a casual setting where the author wasn't in the right frame of mind. They were under the influence, which might impair their ability to handle such a serious topic. The grandma's direct approach could have been unprepared, leading to the author's offhand comment. The author is not wrong for refusing to donate, as it's a personal medical decision. However, their reaction might have been inappropriate given the emotional weight of the situation. \n\nBut then, the grandma walked away, indicating she was hurt. The author's flippant remark might have been uncaring, even if they were under the influence. The key here is whether the reaction was disrespectful or if the context (being high and unprepared) excuses it. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the situation was unprepared, and their response was honest given their state. However, the way they phrased it could be seen as dismissive. But considering the context, it's more about the circumstances than the author being the asshole. So, answer B.\n"
