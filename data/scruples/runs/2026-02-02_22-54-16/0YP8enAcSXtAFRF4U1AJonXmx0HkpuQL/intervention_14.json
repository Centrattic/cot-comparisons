Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney. The situation is that the author was at a party, a bit tipsy and had taken some weed, when their grandma suggested they get tested to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was shocked and responded with a question about the aunt's age and concerns about their own health insurance, and also mentioned being too high for the conversation. The family members then walked away and didn't talk to them the rest of the night. The author feels they might be AITA for their reaction, even though they don't want to donate a kidney.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence of both alcohol and cannabis, which might have affected their ability to handle a serious conversation. The family brought up a significant request\u2014organ donation\u2014which is a major decision. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own financial concerns. It's important to note that donating a kidney is a big commitment with potential risks. The author's reaction seems honest but perhaps not delivered in the best way.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they were in a compromised state mentally. People often react differently when not in a sober state. The author didn't agree to donate, which is their right, but their tone and the comment about being too high might have been unhelpful. However, the family's approach might also be questionable. Pressuring someone into such a life-altering decision without proper consideration of their state of mind isn't ideal. The author's right to set boundaries is valid, and their concerns about health insurance are legitimate. The family might have mishandled the situation by bringing it up in a social setting when the author wasn't in the right frame of mind. So, while the author's reaction could have been more tactful, the main fault might lie with the family for the inappropriate timing and pressure. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
