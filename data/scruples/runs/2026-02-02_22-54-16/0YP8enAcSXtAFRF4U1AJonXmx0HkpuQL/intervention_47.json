Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. I need to figure out if the author's response was appropriate.\n\nFirst, the author was at a party, a bit tipsy and had just used weed. They were in a relaxed setting, not expecting a serious conversation. The grandma brought up the idea of a kidney donation suddenly. The author's response was to question the great-aunt's age and mention their insurance and being high. Then grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the conversation and the author's state of mind. They were under the influence, which might have made them less able to handle a serious topic. Also, the topic of donating a kidney is a huge decision. The author didn't agree, which is their right, but the way they reacted might have been abrupt or disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the family approached them in a casual setting without prior discussion. The author's concerns about their health insurance are valid. People have the right to make their own medical decisions, even if it's about family. The $25k offer could be seen as payment, but in some places, selling organs is illegal, so that might complicate things. But the main issue here is the author's reaction.\n\nThe author's response was to question the great-aunt's age and mention their state. The grandma left, implying she was hurt. The author later felt bad about the way they reacted. So, was the reaction inappropriate? Maybe the author could have been more diplomatic, but considering their state and the unexpected nature of the request, their response is understandable. They might not be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the family didn't seem to consider the author's personal relationship with the great-aunt. The author doesn't have a close bond, so the expectation to donate a kidney might be unreasonable. The author's right to say no is important. Even if the reaction was blunt, the underlying decision is their own. So, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
