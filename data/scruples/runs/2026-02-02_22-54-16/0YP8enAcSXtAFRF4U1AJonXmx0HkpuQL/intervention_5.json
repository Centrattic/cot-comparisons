Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about donating a kidney to a great-aunt. The person reacted by saying their health insurance is bad and that they were too high to discuss it. The family members then walked away and didn't talk to them for the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was tipsy and had just taken some weed, which is common at their house. They were in a social setting, a family party. The grandma brought up the request out of nowhere. The person was shocked and responded with some hesitation, pointing out the aunt's age and their own insurance issues. They also mentioned not being in the right state of mind for such a big decision.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the reaction was wrong. Donating an organ is a serious decision that requires careful consideration. The person didn't outright refuse but expressed concerns. However, their tone and the fact that they were under the influence might come off as dismissive or disrespectful. But given the circumstances, maybe they were just being honest about their inability to handle such a serious conversation in that state.\n\nThe family's reaction was to walk away, which seems a bit harsh. The person isn't obligated to donate, and the financial compensation is a factor here. The question is whether the way they reacted was inappropriate. They didn't yell or get angry, just expressed their hesitations. The grandma's immediate walk away might have contributed to the tension. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the person has the right to refuse, and the way they communicated it might not be the issue. They were honest about their state of mind and their concerns. The family members might have expected a more positive response, but the person isn't wrong for not being enthusiastic. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
