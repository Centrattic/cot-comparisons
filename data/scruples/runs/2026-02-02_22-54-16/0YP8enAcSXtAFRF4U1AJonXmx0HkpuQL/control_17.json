Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted to being asked to donate a kidney. The situation involves the author being tipsy and high when their mom and grandma brought up the request.\n\nFirst, the author's state of mind: they were under the influence of weed, which might affect their ability to have a serious conversation. They responded with a comment about the aunt's age and their own insurance, which could come off as dismissive or insensitive. The grandma walked away, and the author feels guilty about the way they handled it.\n\nNow, considering the ethics: donating a kidney is a major decision. The author isn't obligated to do it, especially since their relationship with the aunt isn't close. The financial incentive of $25k might be a factor, but the author's main concern is their own health and financial security. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to decline and their communication style. While the author has the right to say no, the way they expressed it\u2014being flippant about the aunt's age and mentioning their high state\u2014could have been more respectful. However, the main issue was the inappropriate timing and the author's state of being. They didn't outright refuse but raised valid concerns. \n\nThe family might have approached the topic in a sensitive way, but the author's reaction wasn't malicious. They were honest about their concerns and the situation. The grandma's reaction of walking away might have been more about the tone than the content. \n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" the author isn't wrong for not wanting to donate. The way they reacted could have been handled better, but given their state and the suddenness of the request, it's not entirely their fault. The answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because they have the right to decline and their concerns are valid, even if the delivery was less than ideal.\n"
