Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney. The author was at a party, was tipsy and had just smoked weed, and their grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney. The author responded with a question about the aunt's age and mentioned their insurance concerns, then said they were too high to talk about it. The mom and grandma then left the conversation and didn't talk to them the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence, both alcohol and weed, which might have affected their ability to handle a serious conversation. They were in a social setting, a party, not the best time for such a heavy discussion. The family is asking for a major life decision\u2014organ donation\u2014which is a big deal. The author's response was blunt, but maybe they were just being honest given the situation.\n\nThen, the financial aspect: the family is offering $25k. Organ donation is typically not a transactional thing, but the money here might be for expenses or a reward? Wait, in many places, selling organs is illegal, so the offer might be problematic. The author might not want to get involved in something unethical or illegal, but the family is offering money regardless.\n\nThe author's reaction: they were shocked, made a joke about age, mentioned their insurance, and said they were too high. The grandma walked away. The author feels bad about the way they reacted, not the decision not to donate. The question is whether the way they reacted is wrong.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether their response was inappropriate. They were in a social setting, not the best time for such a conversation, and they were under the influence. Their response was honest but maybe not diplomatic. However, they didn't commit to anything and explained their concerns. The family might have been insensitive for bringing it up in a party, especially when the person wasn't in a good mental state. The author's response, while perhaps not the most respectful, was a refusal, which is their right. The grandma taking offense might be because of cultural or family expectations, but the author isn't obligated to comply. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were in a state where they couldn't properly handle the conversation, and their response, while blunt, was honest. The family may have approached them inappropriately.\n"
