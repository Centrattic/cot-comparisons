Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The setup is that the author was at a party, tipsy and had just smoked weed. The family members brought up the request, and the author's response was a bit flippant, like \"isn't she kind of old?\" and mentioned their health insurance and being too high. Then grandma walked away, and the author is feeling bad about how they reacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which affects judgment and how one processes serious conversations. Being in such a state might make their reaction seem off or dismissive. Also, the request is about a major medical decision\u2014donating a kidney. That's a huge commitment with long-term health implications. The author is not close to the great-aunt, which is important. They don't have a meaningful relationship, so the pressure to donate might not be there. \n\nThe financial compensation is mentioned\u2014$25k. That might complicate things because it could be seen as a transactional offer, but the author's response was about their insurance and the risks. The author's initial reaction of being shocked is understandable given the suddenness and the situation they were in.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the request (sudden, during a party, under the influence) and the relationship with the great-aunt. The author's response was in line with their feelings but might have come off as disrespectful due to the drug/alcohol influence. However, the core issue is the request itself. The author isn't obligated to donate, especially to someone they don't know well. The way they reacted might have been inappropriate, but the main wrong might be more on the family for pressing the issue without considering the author's state and relationship. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's reaction. The author was not in the right state to handle a serious conversation, and their response was dismissive. However, considering the circumstances, maybe they aren't in the wrong because the request was unexpected and they were under the influence. The author's answer should be that they are not the asshole because they're not responsible for the family's expectations and their state was a factor. So the answer is B.\n"
