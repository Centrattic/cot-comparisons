Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted to their family asking them to donate a kidney. The story is from the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, so the user wants to know if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had smoked weed. Their mom and grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney to a great-aunt. The author responded with some sarcastic remarks and mentioned their health insurance, then said they were too high to talk about it. The family was upset, and the author feels bad about their reaction but not about the decision itself.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's emotional state during the conversation (under the influence), their response, and the family's reaction. The author is questioning if their reaction was inappropriate, even though they believe their decision to not donate is valid.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nI should consider the context. The author was under the influence and in a family setting. The family approached them about a serious decision, which is a major life choice. The author's response might have come off as dismissive or uncooperative, but given their state, maybe they were just being honest. However, the way they reacted\u2014especially in a social setting\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. But the author's reasoning for not donating is valid (health insurance concerns), and they did express that. The grandma walked away, which shows the conversation was tense.\n\nIn AITA situations, the community often considers intentions and the context. The author wasn't being malicious, just perhaps not in the right state to handle the conversation. The family might feel blindsided, but the author has the right to decline. The way they reacted might not be the best, but it's not necessarily wrong. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
