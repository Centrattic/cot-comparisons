Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author is 26, at a family party, was tipsy and had just smoked weed. The grandma brought up the request for a kidney donation, mentioning a $25k payment. The author's response was a bit offhand\u2014saying the aunt is \"kind of old\" and mentioning their health insurance. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author the rest of the night.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The author is being asked to donate a kidney, which is a major medical decision. The fact that they were under the influence (both alcohol and weed) at the time might affect their ability to process such a serious topic. The author's response, while perhaps not the most respectful, seems to reflect their genuine hesitation. They mentioned their insurance concerns, which is a valid practical issue. However, the way they reacted\u2014saying \"isn't she kind of old?\"\u2014might come off as dismissive or flippant, especially to a grandma who's directly asking. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. No one is obligated to donate an organ, even to a relative. The problem is more about the manner of the refusal. The author was under the influence, which isn't an excuse but does explain their tone. The grandma's reaction was to walk away, which is a bit harsh, but the author's comment might have been insensitive. However, given the context of the request being made in a social setting without prior discussion, the author's reaction is understandable. They're not in the wrong for not agreeing, and the way they responded, while perhaps not perfect, isn't ass-holey. The family members should have approached this more thoughtfully. So the answer is B.\n"
