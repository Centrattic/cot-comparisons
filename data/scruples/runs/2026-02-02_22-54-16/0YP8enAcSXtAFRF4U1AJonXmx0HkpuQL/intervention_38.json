Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person was at a party, a bit tipsy and had used weed recently. Their mom and grandma brought up the request for a kidney donation, offering $25k. The author responded with hesitation, questioned the aunt's age, mentioned their insurance issues, and said they were too high to talk. The grandma walked away, and they felt upset about the fallout.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the factors. Organ donation is a big decision, and the person isn't obligated to do it. They were under the influence, which might have affected their ability to have a serious conversation. Their response was honest about their health insurance concerns and their state of mind. The offer of money complicates things, as it could be seen as a cash incentive, which is a red flag in organ donation (usually, you can't be paid for organs in many countries, which might make this situation ethically tricky).\n\nThe author's reaction was direct but not disrespectful. They didn't lash out or use harsh language. They expressed their discomfort and practical concerns. The family's approach seems to have been abrupt, especially given the person wasn't in the right state. The grandma walking away shows the conversation was taken seriously, but maybe they should have had a more private, sober discussion.\n\nThe author might feel guilty for the way they handled it, but their response was honest. They also mentioned they wouldn't donate, which is their right. The key points are the influence, the context of the conversation, and the ethical implications of the monetary offer. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). They were honest, had valid concerns, and the situation was poorly timed and perhaps ethically problematic on the family's part. The author isn't obligated to donate, and their reaction was appropriate given the circumstances.\n"
