Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family member asking them to donate a kidney under less-than-ideal circumstances.\n\nFirst, the author was at a family party, tipsy and had just smoked weed. That's important because it's not a situation where someone is in a clear headspace to discuss such a major decision. Kidney donation is a serious medical procedure with long-term consequences. Being under the influence could impair judgment and the ability to have a rational conversation.\n\nNext, the author's grandmother brought up the request in the middle of a social gathering. The way it was introduced seems abrupt and possibly without prior discussion. The amount of money offered ($25k) might also be a factor here, as it could imply a financial incentive, which might be a controversial aspect in organ donation scenarios. However, the author's main concerns were about their health insurance and the risks involved. Those are valid points because donating a kidney can lead to medical issues, and without good insurance, the financial burden could be significant.\n\nThe author's response was to question the age of the great-aunt and mention their health insurance and being high. The grandmother then walked away, and the family stopped talking to them. The author is feeling bad about the way they reacted, not the decision to not donate.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key here is the appropriateness of the request and the context. The family didn't approach the author in a proper setting, and the author was not in a suitable state to discuss such a thing. The author is within their rights to refuse, especially since they're not close to the great-aunt. The financial offer might also be a red flag, as it could pressure someone into a decision they might not make otherwise. However, in some countries, monetary compensation for organs is illegal, so maybe that's a family's own issue.\n\nThe author's response, while maybe not diplomatic, was honest. They pointed out their own limitations (being high) and the potential risks. The grandmother's reaction was to walk away, which is a bit harsh too. The author isn't obligated to donate, so their refusal isn't wrong. The way they said it might have been abrupt, but given the context, it's understandable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
