Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a family member asking her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt. She was under the influence of alcohol and weed when this conversation happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was not in a sober state, which might affect her judgment and how she responded. She was shocked and gave a flippant reply about the aunt being old. Then she mentioned her insurance concerns, which are valid. But the way she reacted might have hurt her grandma's feelings, leading to them avoiding her for the rest of the party.\n\nThe key points: The author is not obligated to donate a kidney. She made that clear. The problem is whether her reaction was inappropriate. The grandma was upset, so maybe the author could have handled it better even in her impaired state. But she was under the influence, which might explain her tone. Also, the financial incentive of $25k might not be the right approach, but that's the family's perspective.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong for declining. However, the manner of her response could be seen as dismissive. But considering her state at the time, maybe it's understandable. The user thinks she's not in the wrong, and maybe that's correct. The answer is B.\n"
