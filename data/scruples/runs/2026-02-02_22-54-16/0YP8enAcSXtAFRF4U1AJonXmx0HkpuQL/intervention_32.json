Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for their reaction to being asked to donate a kidney. I need to decide between A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was at a family party, a bit drunk and high. Her mom and grandma asked her to consider donating a kidney to her great-aunt, offering $25k. She responded with hesitation, questioned the age, mentioned her insurance issues, and said she was too high to talk. Then her grandma walked away, and they didn't talk to her for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about her reaction but not about refusing the donation.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let's break it down. Organ donation is a big decision. The author is not obligated to donate, especially since her relationship with the great-aunt isn't close. The family is asking her to make a life-altering choice on the spot while she's under the influence. That's not a good situation for making such a decision. Her response was honest about her current state and concerns about her own health insurance. She didn't commit to anything, just expressed reluctance. The grandmother's reaction of walking away seems harsh, but the author's response was appropriate given the circumstances. She wasn't rude beyond stating her position and current inability to engage seriously. The financial incentive might also be a factor, as it's not typical for family to offer money for organ donation, which could complicate things. The author's feelings of being upset but also justified in her stance make sense. The key points are the lack of a close relationship, the inappropriate timing and state of mind, and the author's right to say no without being confrontational. So, I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
