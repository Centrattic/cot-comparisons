Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, which means they were under the influence. In that state, they were approached about donating a kidney. The author responded with some flippant remarks, like asking if the great-aunt wasn't too old, and mentioned their insurance issues and being too high. The grandmother walked away upset, and the author feels bad about the way they reacted.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't agree to donate the kidney, which is their right. The question is whether their reaction was wrong. The grandmother and mom were very direct, offering money, which could be seen as a bribe. The author's response was perhaps not the best in terms of tone, but given the context\u2014being under the influence and the unexpectedness of the request\u2014it's understandable. They did express concerns about their own health insurance and the appropriateness of the timing.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they know they're not wrong for not donating, but unsure about their reaction. The problem is whether the way they reacted was inconsiderate. The grandmother got upset and walked away, so the author might feel guilty. However, the request to donate an organ is a huge decision, and the author had every right to be cautious and to refuse. The fact that they were under the influence could have affected their judgment, but they did voice their concerns and made their position clear.\n\nIn such situations, it's important to consider the ethical implications of pressuring someone for an organ donation, especially with a financial incentive, which is actually illegal in many places. The author's response, while maybe not the most tactful, shows they were thinking about their own health and the appropriateness of the conversation. The grandmother's reaction might be more about the tone than the content.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for refusing to donate, and while their reaction could have been smoother, the context (intoxicated, unexpected request) mitigates their responsibility. The real issue might be the family's approach in making such a request in the first place, especially with money involved. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No.\n"
