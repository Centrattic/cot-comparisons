Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and the person reacted by saying the aunt is old and mentioning their health insurance and being high.\n\nFirst, the author was in a social setting, tipsy and had just smoked weed. That's important because it's not a great time for serious conversations. The grandma brought up the kidney donation out of nowhere, which is a big, life-altering request. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own financial situation. They also pointed out they were not in the right state to discuss it. \n\nThe family then distanced themselves, and the author feels bad about the reaction. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nDonating a kidney is a major decision. The author has the right to refuse, especially since they don't have a close relationship with the aunt. The financial compensation is mentioned, but even with money, the health risks are significant. The author's response was honest about their current state and concerns. They didn't agree, but they expressed valid reasons. The family shouldn't have sprung such a big request in a casual, intoxicated setting. The author's reaction was appropriate given the circumstances. They didn't act out of malice but were straightforward. So, I think the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
