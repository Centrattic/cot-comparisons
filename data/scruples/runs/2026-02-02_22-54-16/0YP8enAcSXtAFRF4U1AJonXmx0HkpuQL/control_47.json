Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and the author's reaction was to question the aunt's age and mention their own insurance issues, plus being high at the time.\n\nFirst, the author was under the influence of weed and alcohol. That's a key point because it might have affected their judgment and how they communicated. Being in a tipsy state isn't a great time for serious discussions, especially one as major as organ donation. The author did acknowledge they weren't in the right state of mind, which is honest.\n\nThen, the conversation started. The grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney. The author's first response was, \"Umm... isn't she kind of old?\" That could come off as dismissive or insensitive, but considering the context, maybe they were just reacting impulsively. The mom countered by saying the aunt could live to 90 or 100, which seems hopeful.\n\nThe author then mentioned their health insurance being bad, which is a valid concern. Organ donation can have risks and post-surgery complications, so being worried about debt is understandable. Plus, they added they were too high to have the conversation, which is also true because being impaired isn't conducive to thoughtful discussion.\n\nThe grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about the way they reacted. Now, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. \n\nOrgan donation is a big decision, and the author is 26, so they have the right to say no. The motivations here: the family is pushing for them to donate, possibly out of desperation for their great-aunt. The author's response, while maybe not the best phrased, is about valid concerns. However, the way they phrased the first part could have been more compassionate. Instead of saying \"kind of old,\" maybe they could have expressed their concerns more sensitively. But given the context of being high and not wanting to give a kidney, which is a personal and significant choice, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The family might have approached the topic without considering the author's state and readiness to discuss it. The $25k offer complicates things a bit, but the user didn't mention that in the answer options. The main issue is the reaction during the conversation. \n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole for refusing to donate, but maybe the way they said it could have been better. However, since the situation was caught in the moment (intoxicated) and they did voice their concerns, the answer would likely be B (No). The family should have been more considerate of the author's state and not sprung such a big request during a social gathering. The author's response was honest, albeit blunt, but their health and personal choice are important. So the answer is B.\n"
