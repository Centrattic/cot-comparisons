Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author being asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt, and they responded in a way that upset their family.\n\nFirst, the author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. That's a key point because being impaired might affect their judgment and how they handled the situation. The family brought up the request unexpectedly, and the author's reaction was to question the aunt's age and mention their financial concerns. The mom and grandma took offense, and the author is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nThe main issues here are consent, the appropriateness of the setting, and the state of mind during the conversation. Donating an organ is a major decision, and it's not something that should be discussed in a casual, impromptu setting, especially when the potential donor is under the influence. The author isn't obligated to donate a kidney, so their refusal is understandable. However, the way they reacted\u2014making a comment about the aunt's age (\"isn't she kind of old?\") and mentioning being high\u2014could be seen as dismissive or flippant, which might have hurt the family's feelings. \n\nBut considering the context, the author was in a party environment, not a serious discussion. The family members may have approached the topic without proper preparation or sensitivity. The author's concerns about health insurance and financial risk are valid reasons to be cautious. The offer of $25,000 is also a red flag, as organ donation should not be monetized. \n\nSo, while the author's tone might have been inconsiderate, the underlying reasons for their refusal are valid. They were not in the right state of mind, and the approach by the family was inappropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for declining, and the way they reacted, while maybe not the most diplomatic, isn't deserving of blame given the circumstances. The family should have discussed such a serious matter more thoughtfully and at an appropriate time.\n"
