Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a family party where the author's mom and grandma asked her to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was tipsy and had just smoked weed, which probably affected her judgment. She reacted with a dismissive comment about the aunt's age and her insurance, and her grandma walked away. Now, the author is wondering if she's the asshole for her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence, which might have made her less composed. The request was sudden and serious, and she wasn't in the right state to handle it. The family is asking for a major, life-altering decision without proper discussion. The payment of $25k raises questions\u2014should money be involved in organ donation? That's a red flag. The author's response was blunt but honest. She mentioned her health insurance concerns, which are valid. The grandma's reaction was to walk away, which is also a bit harsh.\n\nThe main question is about the author's reaction. Was it wrong? The author was in a vulnerable state (drugged and drunk) and the topic was heavy. Her response, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was a genuine expression of her unwillingness. The family, on the other hand, brought up a serious request during a social event without considering the author's state. The grandma's immediate reaction to walk away suggests that the conversation wasn't handled well by either side. \n\nAlso, the payment aspect complicates things. Organ donation should ideally be altruistic. Offering money might be a factor in the family's approach, which is ethically questionable. The author's refusal is valid, and her reaction, while perhaps not the best, is understandable given the circumstances. The main issue is the family's approach, not necessarily the author's response. So, the answer is likely B. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
