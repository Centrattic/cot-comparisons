Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney. I need to figure out if the answer is A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, the situation: the author was at a family party, a bit under the influence of alcohol and weed. Their grandma brought up the topic of donating a kidney to a great-aunt. The author responded with hesitation, mentioned their insurance issues, and said they were too high for the conversation. The mom and grandma were upset and didn't talk to them the rest of the night.\n\nSo, the key points here are the context of the conversation (the author's state of mind), the nature of the request (donating a kidney is a major, life-changing decision), and the appropriateness of the family bringing up such a serious topic in a casual setting, especially when the person is not in a good mental state.\n\nThe author's response was to express confusion and concern about their health insurance and the appropriateness of the conversation. They didn't immediately refuse, but pointed out valid concerns. Also, they were honest about not being in the right state to discuss something so serious.\n\nNow, considering the family's reaction, the mom and grandma were upset. But was the author's reaction inappropriate? The author was under the influence, which might have made the conversation more difficult, but they were clear in their hesitation. The family members might have approached the topic in a way that was too abrupt or didn't consider the author's state. \n\nKidney donation is a major decision with significant health and financial risks. The author has the right to be cautious and to not feel pressured into such a life-altering choice, especially when not sober. The offer of $25k could be seen as a financial incentive, which might complicate the situation, as organ donation is typically voluntary.\n\nThe author's response, while maybe a bit blunt or sarcastic (like \"isn't she kind of old?\"), was a valid initial reaction. The family might have been more sensitive in how they approached the request, considering the author's state and the suddenness of the topic. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't obligated to donate, and their reaction was honest. However, the way they responded, especially being under the influence, might have been seen as dismissive. But given the seriousness of the topic and the context, it's more about the family's approach being inconsiderate. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
