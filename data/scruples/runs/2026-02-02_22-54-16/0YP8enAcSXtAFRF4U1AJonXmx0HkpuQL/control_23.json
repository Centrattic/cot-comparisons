Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The story says the author was tipsy and had just smoked weed, which affected their judgment. They responded with a comment about the aunt's age and their own insurance, then said they were too high for the conversation. The family members were upset and didn't talk to them the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The author was under the influence of both alcohol and cannabis, which they admit is normal in their household. Being in a social setting, maybe the party atmosphere contributed to the casual approach they took. The family is asking for a major, life-changing decision\u2014organ donation\u2014which is serious. The author's response was flippant, especially the \"isn't she kind of old?\" line, which could come off as dismissive. However, they did back it up with concerns about their insurance and the state they were in. \n\nBut the key points are: the author was not in a right state of mind, they were honest about their objections, and they didn't commit to anything. The family's demand for a kidney donation is a big ask, especially from someone who isn't close to the relative. The author's reaction, while maybe not the most tactful, was honest and they weren't pressured into any commitment. The money offer might also be a factor, which could complicate things if the family felt it was a transactional offer.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it more respectfully. The comment about the aunt's age might have been insensitive. But given the influence of substances and the author's right to make their own medical decisions, they have a valid stance. The question is whether their reaction was wrong. Since they didn't agree and were upfront about their state and concerns, it's more about the tone rather than the decision itself. The family's reaction was to walk away, which suggests they were hurt, but the author's position is defensible. So the answer would lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
