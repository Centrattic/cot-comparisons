Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, which affected their judgment. The conversation started with discussing the great-aunt's health, and suddenly the grandma suggested the author donate a kidney, offering $25k. The author was shocked and responded with a question about the aunt's age and concerns about their own insurance and the timing of the conversation. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about the reaction.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider a few points. The author was under the influence, which might have impaired their ability to handle a serious conversation. They expressed their discomfort and valid concerns about health insurance and the situation. The family brought up the topic rather abruptly, possibly without giving the author time to process. The financial incentive might be a red flag, as it could pressure the decision. The author isn't obligated to donate, and their reaction, while maybe not tactful, was honest about their state and concerns. The grandma's immediate walkaway seems harsh. \n\nThe main question is whether the author's reaction was wrong. The author's response was direct and included their current state and worries. Even though it might have come off as dismissive or disrespectful, given the context (impaired state, sudden pressure), it's understandable. They didn't agree to donate, which is their right, and their concerns are legitimate. The family's approach was probably abrupt and possibly inconsiderate. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
