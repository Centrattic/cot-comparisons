Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for her reaction when her family asked her to donate a kidney. The situation involves her being tipsy and high when the conversation happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence of alcohol and cannabis, which might have affected her judgment and how she responded. Her family brought up the request in a casual party setting, which isn't the best environment for a serious discussion about organ donation. \n\nThe author's response was to question her great-aunt's age and her own health insurance. It's reasonable for her to express concerns about the financial implications and her own well-being. Organ donation is a major decision with long-term consequences, and it's important that it's done with full consent and understanding, not under the influence. \n\nHer mom and grandma reacted negatively, not talking to her for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about how she handled it, but she's not willing to donate. The key points here are consent and the appropriateness of the situation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, organ donation should always be voluntary and not pressured. The family offered money, which could be seen as adding pressure or even implying a transaction. The author was not in a state to make such a decision, so her reaction, while maybe abrupt, is justified given her mental state at the time. \n\nAlso, considering the relationship with the great-aunt, the author doesn't have a close bond, which might make the request seem more out of the blue. She has the right to prioritize her own health and financial stability. \n\nThe author's main mistake might have been the way she responded, but given her state, it's understandable. The family should have approached the topic in a more respectful and appropriate setting. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
