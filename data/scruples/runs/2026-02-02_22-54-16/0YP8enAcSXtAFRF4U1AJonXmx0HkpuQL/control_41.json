Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction when family members asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. \n\nFirst, the author was in a social setting, had been drinking and smoking weed. They were not in a serious frame of mind. The request was pretty sudden and unexpected. The author's response was to question the age of the aunt and their own health insurance issues, and admitted they were too high to discuss it. The family members took offense, and the author feels bad about the way they reacted.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author had the right to say no to donating an organ. They were under the influence, which might have affected their communication style. The question is whether the way they expressed their refusal was wrong. \n\nThe author didn't lash out or be disrespectful. They were honest about their state and concerns. The grandma walked away, but the author's response was factual (insurance issues) and a bit blunt, maybe. However, considering the context of being impaired, the author's reaction is understandable. Family can be pushy, and the author's right to set boundaries should be respected. \n\nIn general, people shouldn't be pressured into organ donations, especially not to a distant relative they don't know well. The offer of money complicates it further, but in the US, you can't sell a kidney legally. The author's concerns about their own health and financial stability are valid. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to donate, and the way they reacted, while maybe not the most tactful, is within their right. The answer is B.\n"
