Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted to their family's request to donate a kidney. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person is 26, at a family party, under the influence of alcohol and weed. Their mom and grandma ask them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, offering $25k. The person reacts with shock, makes a comment about the aunt's age, and mentions their health insurance issues. The grandma walks out, leading to tension.\n\nThe key points to consider here are the context of the conversation and the person's state. They were under the influence, which might have affected their judgment and ability to handle a serious topic. Also, the family is asking for a significant sacrifice\u2014donating a kidney\u2014without considering the person's feelings or circumstances. The payment of $25k seems like a bribe, which is actually illegal in many places, so that adds another layer of ethical issues.\n\nThe person's response does come off as dismissive, but given their state, it's understandable. They were shocked and didn't handle it gracefully, but the main issue is the family's approach. They brought up the request in a casual setting without respecting the person's autonomy. The person isn't obligated to give a kidney, especially to someone not close to them. The way they reacted might have been inappropriate, but the fault isn't entirely theirs. The family should have approached this more sensitively and not in a party setting while the person was impaired.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's approach was poor, and the author's reaction, while not perfect, was a valid expression of their discomfort and shock under the circumstances.\n"
