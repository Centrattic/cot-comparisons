Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (ITA). The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and the author's reaction was to question the aunt's age and express concerns about their health insurance and being high. The author is wondering if they were an asshole for reacting that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. That's important because it might explain their immediate, perhaps less considerate response. But the grandma's request was pretty sudden and maybe not discussed in depth beforehand. The author didn't outright refuse but questioned the age and health insurance issues, which are valid practical concerns. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about the way they handled it.\n\nOn one hand, the author's reaction was in a less-than-optimal mental state. They were high, so their response might not have been as thoughtful as it should have been. But they did raise valid points about the risks involved in donating a kidney, especially with their health insurance situation. The offer of $25k might also be a point of contention\u2014maybe the author felt pressured or that the financial incentive was improper, though in reality, paying for organ donations is illegal, so that might be a red flag.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't show a lot of empathy in the moment. They said \"isn't she kind of old?\" which could come off as dismissive. Even if the author was high, the way they phrased their response might have been hurtful. However, the grandma brought up the request in a party setting, which isn't the best time for such a serious conversation. The author's right to set boundaries and express concerns is important.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author's state of mind, the validity of their concerns, the appropriateness of the setting for the conversation, and the fact that they didn't outright refuse but had valid reservations, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to decline or ask questions about donating an organ, especially when it's not a close relationship. The way they reacted might have been harsh, but given the circumstances and their state, it's understandable. The main issue here is the grandma and mom's approach, not the author's response.\n"
