Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, which they found unexpected and reacted to while under the influence of alcohol and weed.\n\nFirst, the context: the author was at a family party, had consumed alcohol and marijuana, and was in a relaxed, not serious state. The family members brought up the donation request without prior notice. The author's initial reaction was to question the aunt's age and their own health insurance concerns, which are valid points. They also mentioned being too high for the conversation, which shows self-awareness about their state.\n\nThe family's reaction was to walk away, and the author feels bad about how they responded. The key points here are the timing and the author's state of mind. Being under the influence might have affected their ability to respond appropriately, but they did express their concerns. The offer of $25k for a kidney could also be a red flag, as organ donation should be altruistic, not transactional. However, the author didn't agree to donate, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nThe author's response was honest about their feelings and the practical issues involved. They didn't outright refuse rudely but instead expressed their confusion and concerns. Given the context of the situation\u2014unexpected request during a social event, under the influence\u2014it's reasonable to think they weren't in the right frame of mind for such a serious discussion. The family members initiating the conversation without considering the author's state might also be part of the problem.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their reaction, while perhaps not the most composed, was honest and based on valid concerns. The family might have handled the request more sensitively, but the author's response was a genuine expression of their feelings and practical considerations.\n"
