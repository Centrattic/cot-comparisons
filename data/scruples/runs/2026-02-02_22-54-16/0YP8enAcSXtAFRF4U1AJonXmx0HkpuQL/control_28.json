Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction when family asked them to donate a kidney. The situation involves the author being under the influence of weed and alcohol during a family party. The key points to consider are the author's state of mind, the appropriateness of the family's request, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the author was tipsy and had recently used a dab, making them not in the right frame of mind for a serious conversation. That's a red flag because important decisions, especially ones involving major surgery and organ donation, require clear thinking. The family brought up the request in a casual setting without prior discussion, which might have been abrupt.\n\nThe author's response was direct but maybe not the most diplomatic. They questioned the aunt's age and mentioned their insurance concerns, which are valid points. However, the way it was phrased could come off as dismissive or flippant, especially given their state. The grandma's reaction of walking away shows the conversation was tense.\n\nThe family didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night, indicating hurt feelings. The author is now conflicted about whether their reaction was inconsiderate. The offer of $25k for donation is also a bit odd because organ donation is illegal to be bought/sold in most places, which might complicate things ethically.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing to donate, but their reaction could be seen as insensitive due to their impaired state and the context. However, they have a right to decline, and the family's approach might have been inappropriate too. The main issue is the author's state during the conversation and the way they communicated their refusal. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the refusal is personal and the main fault isn't entirely on the author.\n"
