Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for their reaction to being asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The context is that they were tipsy and high when the conversation happened, which might have affected their judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author was in a social setting, not in a clear-headed state, and was approached with a significant and serious request. The family offered money, which adds a layer of complexity. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and express concerns about their own health insurance and being too high to discuss it. The family then walked away, leading the author to feel bad about their reaction.\n\nEthically, donating an organ is a major decision. The author has the right to say no, especially given the potential risks involved. The fact that they were under the influence at the time could have contributed to their flippant or dismissive tone. However, the pressure from family to make such a life-altering decision in the moment is also questionable. The family should have approached this with more sensitivity and given the author time to consider without being in a compromised state.\n\nThe author's concerns about their health insurance are valid because medical debt is a real issue. The financial compensation offered might not be enough to cover potential long-term costs. Also, the family's reaction\u2014walking away and not talking to the author\u2014suggests they may have overreacted. The author's main mistake might be responding in a way that was unkind or dismissive, but their right to refuse remains intact.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author's right to decline, the influence of substances, the validity of their concerns, and the family's approach, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to express their discomfort and the situation was not handled well by the family either.\n"
