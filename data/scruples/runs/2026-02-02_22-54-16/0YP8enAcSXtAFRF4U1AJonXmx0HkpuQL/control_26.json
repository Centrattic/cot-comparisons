Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves family members asking her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt, which she refuses. The main points to consider are her reaction, the context, and the family's response.\n\nFirst, the author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. That's mentioned as a reason she wasn't in the right state of mind. People do sometimes make snap decisions or say things they regret when impaired, so that's a factor here. She responded with a question about the aunt's age and then mentioned her health insurance and being high. The mom and grandma took it in a bad way, and the grandma left.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, donating a kidney is a huge decision. The author isn't obligated to do that, especially for someone not close to her. The fact that they offered money complicates things, but maybe that's just the family's way of trying to make it easier. However, the way she reacted might have been abrupt. She was under the influence, so maybe she didn't handle it as gracefully as possible. But on the other hand, she's not wrong for not wanting to donate a kidney. The question is whether the reaction was inconsiderate.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is at fault for her response. She did express her concerns, but maybe in a dismissive way (\"isn't she kind of old?\") which could have been hurtful. However, given the circumstances (impaired state, lack of close relationship with the great-aunt), her refusal is understandable. The family's reaction might be overblown, but the author's response could have been more diplomatic. Still, she's not wrong for not wanting to donate. So the answer is B.\n"
