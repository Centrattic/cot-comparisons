Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt by their mom and grandma during a family party. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened, which might have affected their judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was not in the right state of mind\u2014tipsy and high. That's a key point. When someone is under the influence, their responses can be impulsive or inappropriate, not necessarily malicious. The author did express their concerns about health insurance and the timing of the conversation, which seems reasonable. They also mentioned that the great-aunt isn't a significant part of their life, so the expectation for a kidney donation might be unreasonable from that angle.\n\nThe relatives' reaction was to walk away and not talk to the author for the rest of the night. The author feels guilty about their reaction, which was a bit dismissive (\"isn't she kind of old?\") and maybe sarcastic. However, the author is clear they don't want to donate, which is their right. The question is whether the way they reacted makes them the asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the author was under the influence, which can lead to poor communication. But on the other hand, the request came up suddenly in a family setting, and the author's response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, was honest. They also mentioned health concerns, which are valid. The monetary incentive of $25k might be a factor in the family's approach, but the author isn't obligated to comply. \n\nThe grandma's reaction of walking away might be more about hurt feelings than the content of the response. The author is questioning if they were rude, but given the circumstances, it's a complex situation. The key is whether the author's response was unkind or unnecessarily harsh. The line \"isn't she kind of old?\" could be seen as insensitive, but considering the context of being high and the sudden, serious topic, maybe it's understandable. The author's main point was to decline, which they have the right to do. So, the author might not be in the wrong, as they're protecting their own interests and health. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
