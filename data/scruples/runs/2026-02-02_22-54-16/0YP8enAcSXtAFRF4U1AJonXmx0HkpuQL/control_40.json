Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had just smoked weed. That's a key point. Being under the influence probably affected their ability to handle a serious conversation. The family brought up the great-aunt's health and suggested the author donate a kidney. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and mention their insurance concerns, plus they said they were too high to discuss it. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about their reaction.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author's reaction was inappropriate. On one hand, they were in a state not conducive to serious discussions, which could explain their flippant or dismissive comments. On the other hand, the family was bringing up a serious medical decision that could save a life, which might require a more respectful or thoughtful response. However, the author clearly wasn't in the right mindset, and they also expressed valid concerns about their own health and financial situation. The grandma walked away, which might indicate she was hurt, but the author's response was partly a reaction to the unexpected and heavy request in a social setting where they weren't prepared.\n\nThe key points to consider: the author's state (under the influence), the suddenness of the request, the validity of their concerns about their own health and finances, and the appropriateness of the family bringing up such a serious topic in that context. Also, the author did communicate their refusal, which is their right. The way they reacted might have been harsh, but given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. The question is whether the author is the asshole for the reaction, not for refusing to donate. The author is not obligated to donate, and the family's approach might have been inconsiderate by bringing it up in that setting and while the author was impaired. So, likely the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author's reaction was a result of being in a compromised state and expressing valid concerns, but they might need to apologize later. However, the initial reaction itself, under those circumstances, isn't entirely their fault.\n"
