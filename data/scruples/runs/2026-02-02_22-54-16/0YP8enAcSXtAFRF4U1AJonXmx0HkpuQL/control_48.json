Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The situation is that the author was tipsy and had just smoked weed when their mom and grandma brought up the request. The author's response was a bit flippant, first questioning the aunt's age and then mentioning their insurance and being high. The family members then left the conversation, leading to tension at the party.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's reaction was inappropriate. They were under the influence, which might have affected their judgment. The family approached them in the middle of a party, which isn't the best time for such a serious discussion. The author's response about the aunt being \"kind of old\" and mentioning their own financial concerns could come off as dismissive or disrespectful, especially given the emotional weight of organ donation. However, the author is under no obligation to donate a kidney, and their concerns about health insurance and financial consequences are valid. The family's approach seems to have been unprepared for the author's potential refusal and didn't handle it well either. The grandma walking away might indicate she felt disrespected, but the author's right to say no is important. The key points here are the context of being high, the appropriateness of the timing and setting, and mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing, but their delivery could have been more considerate. However, given the circumstances, the answer likely leans towards B (No), as the author isn't the asshole for not wanting to donate, even if the manner was a bit off. The family also shares some responsibility for bringing up such a serious topic in a casual, party setting while the author was under the influence.\n"
