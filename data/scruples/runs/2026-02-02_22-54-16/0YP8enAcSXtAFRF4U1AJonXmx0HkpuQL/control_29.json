Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. \n\nFirst, the context: The author was at a party, had been drinking and using weed, and was caught off guard by the request. The family offered $25k for the donation. The author was shocked and responded with some questions about the aunt's age and their own health insurance. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author the rest of the night.\n\nThe author feels bad about their reaction, thinking maybe they were too harsh. But the key points here are the circumstances. The author was in a compromised state (tipsy and high), the request was sudden and unexpected, and the conversation was in a social setting. They didn't say yes, which is their right. They also raised valid concerns about their own health and financial situation. \n\nThe grandma walked away first, implying they were upset by the author's response. But the author's reaction seems honest and practical. They were not in a good state for a serious conversation, which is acknowledged. The family is asking for a major organ donation, which is a huge decision. The author is not obligated to do it, especially since their relationship with the great-aunt isn't close. \n\nThe payment of $25k might be a red flag too, as organ donation is typically not monetized. But the author's main issue was the way they reacted, not the refusal itself. Their response was to express confusion and concerns, which is reasonable. The family's reaction (not talking for the rest of the night) seems harsh, but the author isn't wrong for standing their ground.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for reacting how they did given the situation. They were in a bad state, the request was sudden, and they had legitimate concerns. The family should have approached this more sensitively and not in a party setting while the author was under the influence.\n"
