Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt while under the influence of weed. \n\nFirst, the author was tipsy and had just used a dab, which might have affected their judgment. They were in a social setting, a family party. The request came up suddenly from the grandma and mom. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and express concerns about their own health insurance. Then they mentioned they're too high to discuss it. The family members walked away, and the author feels bad about how they reacted.\n\nI need to consider the factors here. The author wasn't in a clear state of mind when the serious question was brought up. Their response was defensive and maybe abrupt. But on the other hand, the request is a huge decision, and the author had legitimate concerns. The offer of $25k might complicate things\u2014motives could be questioned here, but the author isn't obligated to accept.\n\nFamily dynamics matter. The author isn't close to the great-aunt, so their lack of willingness isn't unreasonable. However, the way they responded might have been dismissive. The grandma was hurt, and the mom was upset. But the author was under the influence, which might have made them less articulate or more blunt than they intended. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for the way they reacted? Well, maybe they could have handled it more gracefully. But considering the context\u2014being under the influence, the suddenness of the request, and their valid concerns\u2014it might not be entirely their fault. They have the right to refuse, and the manner of refusal could be seen as a mistake, but not necessarily being in the wrong. \n\nSo, probably answer B, not in the wrong. The key points are the impaired state, the sudden pressure, and the valid personal concerns. The author isn't obligated to donate, and the way they responded, while perhaps hasty, isn't malicious. The family's reaction is also a factor, but the author's actions aren't the main issue here.\n"
