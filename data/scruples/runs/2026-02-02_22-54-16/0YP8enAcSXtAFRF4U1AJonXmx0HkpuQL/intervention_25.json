Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The person was tipsy and had just used weed when the conversation happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know the great-aunt well. The family offered $25k, which might be a red flag because organ donation should be altruistic, not for money. The author's reaction was to question the aunt's age and their own insurance. They also mentioned being high, which makes the conversation inappropriate.\n\nThe question is about whether the reaction was wrong. The author was in a state where they couldn't think straight. They had a right to be honest about their feelings and the risks involved. The family didn't approach the topic sensitively, and the author's response was a genuine expression of their concerns. The fact that the family didn't talk to them afterward suggests they were upset, but the author's honesty might be justified given the circumstances. Also, offering money for a donation is unethical. So the author's way of reacting, while maybe blunt, is understandable. They shouldn't be blamed for not wanting to donate and for speaking up in a moment they were unprepared for.\n"
