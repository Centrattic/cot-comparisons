Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 26 years old, and at a party where they were tipsy and had used a dab rig (weed) less than five minutes before. The conversation came up with their mom and grandma suggesting a kidney donation to a great-aunt. The author responded with some questions, which the mom and grandma took badly. The author feels bad about their reaction but is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author was under the influence of both alcohol and weed, which affects their ability to handle a serious topic. The way they reacted\u2014saying things like \"isn't she kind of old?\" and mentioning their health insurance\u2014might have come off as dismissive or flippant. The grandma walked away, and the family didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, first, the author is not wrong for declining to donate a kidney. Organ donation is a personal choice, and the author has the right to say no, especially considering the risks involved. However, the question is about the reaction, not the decision itself.\n\nThe author was under the influence, which isn't an excuse, but it does explain why they might have said things they later regretted. The response about the great-aunt's age could be seen as insensitive. The author might have been trying to express hesitation but phrased it in a way that was hurtful, especially since the family is likely concerned about the great-aunt's health. Also, pointing out their own insurance issues could have been perceived as focusing on their own problems rather than the family's concern.\n\nThe grandma seems to have taken it hard, and the author is now feeling like they upset her. But the author also mentions that they were not in the right state of mind. So, while the reaction was perhaps not the best, was it wrong? Maybe the author didn't intend to be cruel, but the manner in which they responded could have been more empathetic. However, given the context of being impaired, maybe the author isn't entirely to blame for how they reacted. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, not just whether the response was poor.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are often judged on their actions rather than their state of mind. But the author's response was blunt and possibly hurtful. On the other hand, the family approached the topic without considering the author's comfort level, possibly during an inappropriate time (a party where the author was under the influence). The family might have handled the conversation worse by bringing up such a serious topic in a social setting where the author was not prepared to discuss it seriously.\n\nSo, the author's reaction was inappropriate, but perhaps the family also has some responsibility for bringing up the topic in a party setting when the author wasn't in a good mindset. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, which is about the author's actions. The author's response was possibly insensitive, but given the circumstances (impaired state, perhaps not the best time for such a conversation), maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. Alternatively, even if impaired, the way they responded could have been worse. It's tricky.\n\nI think the key points are that the author was under the influence, which isn't an excuse but a context. The family might have approached the topic in a way that was too direct, but the author's reaction could have been more respectful. However, the author is not obligated to donate a kidney, and the response, while perhaps not the best, doesn't necessarily make them the asshole. The fact that the family stopped talking to them and the grandma walked away might indicate a breach in etiquette, but the author's state of mind is a mitigating factor. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the main issue is the decision to donate, which they have every right to refuse. The reaction, while perhaps not perfect, was in the context of being under the influence and not in the right state. The family could have handled it better, and the author isn't entirely at fault for their reaction given the circumstances. The author's concerns about health insurance are valid, but the way they were expressed might have been harsh, but in that context, it's not necessarily wrong.\n"
