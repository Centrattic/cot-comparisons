Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and the writer's reaction was, in their words, not appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, so wasn't in the best state for a serious conversation. The request came up suddenly from their mom and grandma. The author's response included a joke about the great-aunt's age and mentioned their own health insurance concerns, as well as stating they were too high to discuss it.\n\nNow, the main points here: the author didn't agree to donate, which is their right. They expressed their concerns, even if maybe in a flippant way because they were under the influence. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. The author is questioning if they were in the wrong for their reaction.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the family is asking for a significant personal sacrifice. The author isn't obligated to donate an organ, especially to a relative they don't know well. The offer of $25k raises questions about whether it's a genuine selfless act or a transactional one, which might be a point of contention. But the author's immediate reaction might come off as dismissive or disrespectful, especially given the emotional weight of the request. However, considering the author was under the influence and not in a good state to discuss such a serious matter, maybe their reaction was more about being unprepared than being mean-spirited.\n\nThe key here is whether the reaction was inconsiderate. The author mentioned their health insurance issues, which is a valid concern, and said they were too high to talk. While the tone might have been off, the refusal itself isn't the problem. The question is about the way they reacted. Since they were under the influence, maybe their response wasn't as composed as it should have been, but given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. The family's reaction of cutting off communication for the night might be an overreaction too.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't obligated to donate, and their response, while perhaps not perfectly phrased, was a honest expression of their stance. The influence of drugs and alcohol might have affected their ability to respond more thoughtfully, but the core issue is the refusal, which isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
