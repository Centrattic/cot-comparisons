Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a woman being asked to donate a kidney to her great-aunt. She was under the influence of alcohol and weed when this conversation happened. She reacted by saying the great-aunt is old and mentioned her health insurance issues. Her grandma walked away, and they didn't talk to her for the rest of the party. She's wondering if she's the asshole for her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was tipsy and had just taken a hit of weed, which means she wasn't in a completely sober or composed state. That might affect her ability to handle a serious conversation appropriately. Also, the request was unexpected and pretty heavy. Donating a kidney is a big decision with medical, financial, and personal implications. The family offered $25k, which could be seen as a financial incentive, but maybe that's not the main point here.\n\nThe user's reaction was to question her age and mention her health insurance. She was honest but maybe not diplomatic. However, given her state at the time, it's understandable that she didn't phrase it tactfully. The grandma's reaction was to walk away, which is hurtful, but the initial question is about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Was she wrong to decline the donation? Probably not. 2) Was her reaction inappropriate? Maybe, but considering her state and the suddenness of the request, her response might be seen as a valid expression of her feelings. The family didn't give her time to process or discuss the matter properly. Also, the financial aspect of the offer might be a red flag, but that's more about the family's approach.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author didn't force anyone to take her side. She expressed her concerns, albeit perhaps bluntly. The family's reaction was also harsh, walking away and not engaging further. The author's main issue is feeling like she upset her grandma. However, the question is about whether she is in the wrong. Given the circumstances, her reaction, while maybe not the most polite, is understandable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
