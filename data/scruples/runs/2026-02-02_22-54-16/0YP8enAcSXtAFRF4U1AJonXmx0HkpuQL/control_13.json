Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the author was at a family party, tipsy and had just used weed. They were in a state where they weren't fully composed. The grandma and mom brought up the request out of nowhere. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and mention their health insurance concerns, and also said they were too high for the conversation. The family then gave them the cold shoulder for the rest of the night.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, donating a kidney is a huge decision. The author isn't obligated to do it, especially since they don't have a close relationship with the aunt. Their response might have been blunt, but it's understandable given the context. They were under the influence, which could have affected their reaction. Also, they did express their concerns about health insurance, which is a valid point. The family's reaction was to stop talking, which seems harsh. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to refuse, the context of being under the influence, and the suddenness of the request. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to donate, and their reaction, while maybe not the most tactful, is justified given the circumstances. The family putting pressure on them without considering their readiness or the situation might be the bigger issue here. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
