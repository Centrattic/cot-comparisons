Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a family member wanting to donate a kidney to a great-aunt but reacting in a way that upset her family.\n\nFirst, the person was at a family party, tipsy and high. They were asked to consider a kidney donation, which is a huge decision. The person responded with a question about the aunt's age and mentioned their health insurance issues. The grandmother left, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. The person is now questioning if they were in the wrong for their reaction.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the person was not in a good state of mind (tipsy and high), the question was brought up suddenly, and their response might have been inappropriate or hurtful. The family might have expected a more respectful or thoughtful response, especially considering the context of the party and the relationship with the family members involved.\n\nBut on the other hand, the person is not obligated to donate a kidney, especially to someone they don't know well. The offer of $25k could be seen as a bribe, which might complicate the situation. The person's response about their insurance is a valid concern. However, the way they reacted\u2014maybe being dismissive or making a joke about the aunt's age\u2014could be seen as insensitive. They were under the influence, which might explain the reaction but doesn't necessarily excuse it.\n\nThe key factors are: the appropriateness of the question in the setting, the person's state of mind, the validity of their concerns, and the manner in which they expressed them. The family might have approached the topic in a way that was sudden and possibly overwhelming, especially given the person's state. However, the person could have handled the conversation more diplomatically to avoid hurting their family's feelings. It's a balance between personal autonomy and family dynamics. Since the person clearly isn't the \"asshole\" for not donating, but the way they reacted might have been hurtful, the answer might lean towards them not being in the wrong, but there's some nuance here.\n"
