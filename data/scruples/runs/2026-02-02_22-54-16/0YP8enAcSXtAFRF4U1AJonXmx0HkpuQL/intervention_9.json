Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, and was caught off guard by the request. They responded with hesitation, questioned the aunt's age, mentioned their financial concerns, and said they were too high to discuss it. The mom and grandma then left them in silence, which the author feels bad about.\n\nFirst, donating a kidney is a huge decision. The author clearly isn't comfortable with it, and they have valid concerns about their health insurance and financial stability. It's their body, and they have the right to say no. The fact that they were under the influence might have made them more unprepared for the conversation, but that doesn't mean their response was wrong. They were honest about their stance and their current state of mind. \n\nThe grandma and mom might have been hurt, but the author isn't obligated to be the donor. Reacting with shock and stating their reasons isn't unreasonable. The family brought up the request unexpectedly, and the author's response was direct and honest. They also mentioned the financial incentive, which adds a layer of potential pressure. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy over one's body, the right to decline, and the appropriateness of the conversation given the author's state. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and expressing their discomfort. The family's reaction is their own, but the author's response was justified.\n"
