Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked to donate a kidney. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the person was at a family party, tipsy and had just smoked weed. Their grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney to a great-aunt. The author's response was a bit off, asking if the aunt is too old, implying maybe it's not worth it. Then they mentioned their insurance being bad and not wanting to be in debt. The grandma was upset and walked away. The author is worried about being the asshole for the way they reacted, not the decision itself.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author was under the influence, which might have affected their judgment and how they communicated. They were offered $25k, which is a significant amount. The main issue is whether their reaction was inappropriate, not the decision to refuse. \n\nIn terms of social norms, bringing up such a serious medical decision during a party, especially when someone isn't in the right frame of mind, isn't ideal. The author's response was direct but maybe lacked sensitivity. They were honest about their state and concerns, but the timing and context (tipsy, high) might have made the conversation more confrontational than necessary. \n\nHowever, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to donate a kidney. People have the right to refuse medical procedures, even for family. The problem is how they communicated their refusal. The grandma was upset, which the author acknowledges. But considering the situation, the author's state at the time (high and tipsy) could be a mitigating factor. They were honest about their condition and their concerns about insurance. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more gracefully, even if they were under the influence. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for their reaction. The answer probably hinges on whether the reaction was inappropriate given the circumstances. Since the author was not sober, perhaps their response was understandable, even if it could have been better phrased. \n\nIn AITA contexts, people are often judged on their intent and the context. The author's intent was to refuse, which is their right, and they were upfront about their state. The grandma walking away might have been because of the tone rather than the content. But the author isn't the asshole for the refusal or the reaction, especially under the influence. So the answer is B.\n"
