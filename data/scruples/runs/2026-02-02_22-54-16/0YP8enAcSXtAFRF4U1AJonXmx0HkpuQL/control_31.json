Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt when they were under the influence of weed and alcohol. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was at a family party, had been drinking and smoked weed. The conversation came up with their mom and grandma, asking about donating a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was shocked and responded with a question about the aunt's age and their own insurance concerns. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about how they reacted.\n\nNow, considering the context. The author was not in a clear state of mind due to alcohol and weed. That's important because being under the influence might affect how someone processes a serious conversation. The request to donate a kidney is a huge decision, and the author's reaction seems to be from shock and trying to clarify the situation. They mentioned their insurance issues, which is a valid concern when considering major surgery.\n\nFamily dynamics here matter. The great-aunt isn't a close part of the author's life, so the expectation to donate might be unreasonable. The offer of $25k for a kidney also raises ethical questions because selling organs is illegal in many places, so that's a red flag. The author's mom and grandma might have approached them in a way that was abrupt and without considering the emotional state of the author.\n\nThe author's response was to question the age and their own financial concerns. While the phrasing might have been blunt, given the situation and their state, it's understandable. The grandma walking away shows that the conversation was hurtful, but the author's priorities were their health and finances, which are valid. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't obligated to donate an organ, especially under such circumstances. The way they reacted might be seen as dismissive or unkind, but considering the context of their state and the sudden, serious nature of the request, it's a reaction to a stressful situation. The family's approach might be more at fault for bringing up such a heavy topic during a party when the author was under the influence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not wanting to donate, and their reaction was a response to being blindsided in a compromised state. The family's approach was also questionable. So the answer is B.\n"
