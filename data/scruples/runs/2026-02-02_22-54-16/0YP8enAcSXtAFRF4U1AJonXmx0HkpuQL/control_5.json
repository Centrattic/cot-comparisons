Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their reaction when asked to donate a kidney. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had used weed. The grandma and mom brought up the great-aunt needing a kidney. The author is 26, and the aunt is in her late 70s. The family is offering $25k. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own health insurance issues, then mention they were too high for the conversation. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad for how they reacted.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is not being asked to do something they're comfortable with, which is donating a kidney. That's a huge decision, and they have the right to say no. But the question is about the way they reacted. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for their reaction.\n\nLooking at the reaction: the author was honest about their state (tipsy and high), which is important because it's not a good time for serious conversations. They also raised valid concerns about their own health insurance and financial risks. The grandma walked away, but the author feels they might have been too dismissive or hurtful.\n\nNow, considering the family context. The author doesn't have a close relationship with the great-aunt, which might affect their emotional readiness to make such a sacrifice. The financial incentive is mentioned, but the author is concerned about potential medical debt. That's a practical concern.\n\nThe way the conversation started was abrupt. The grandma \"slipped it in\" during a party. Maybe the family should have approached this more carefully, especially with someone who was under the influence. The author's response was honest but maybe not the most respectful. They said \"isn't she kind of old?\" which could come off as insensitive. The mom's response about living to 100 is a bit of a counter, but the author's reply about their insurance and being high is a valid excuse for not engaging further.\n\nThe author's apology is in the question, acknowledging that the way they reacted might be the issue. The key here is whether the tone was inappropriate. Being under the influence could affect their ability to respond calmly, but they did express their reasons. The grandma walking away might indicate that the conversation wasn't handled well by either side.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't obligated to donate a kidney. They have the right to refuse. However, the manner in which they refused could be seen as dismissive or hurtful, especially towards the grandma. The comment about the aunt's age could be viewed as ageist or insensitive. The mention of being high is a valid reason to disengage, but maybe they should have handled it with more empathy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's refusal is justified, but the way they expressed it might have been harsh. The answer hinges on whether the reaction was appropriate given the context. Since the author was under the influence and in a social setting, their response might not be in the wrong, but there's room to argue that they could have been more tactful. However, the main issue is the family's approach, perhaps, without considering the author's state and relationship with the aunt. The author isn't the asshole for not donating, but maybe the reaction's tone is questionable. However, given the circumstances (being high, not close to the aunt), the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong for their reaction.\n"
