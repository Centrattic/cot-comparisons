Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt when they were under the influence of alcohol and weed.\n\nFirst, the author was tipsy and had just taken a hit of weed, so they weren't in a clear state of mind. Their family brought up the topic suddenly during a party. The author's response was a bit off, like asking if the aunt is old, which might have come off as dismissive or insensitive. But considering their state, maybe they couldn't think straight.\n\nThe mom and grandma reacted by not talking to them for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about the way they reacted but is firm in not donating the kidney. So, the key points are: under the influence, unexpected request, and the response might have been inappropriate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, donating a kidney is a big decision, and the family approached them without much prior discussion. The author's response was maybe not the best, but given their state, it's understandable. They were also upfront about not wanting to proceed. The financial incentive (25k) might be a red flag, but that's more about the family's approach. \n\nThe main issue here is the author's reaction. They said \"isn't she kind of old?\" which could be seen as flippant. However, considering the context of being high and not prepared for such a serious conversation, maybe they're not entirely at fault. The family might have handled it better, approaching the author in a more sober and thoughtful environment. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's response could have been more diplomatic, the circumstances (being under the influence, sudden request) mitigate their responsibility. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but the reasoning is nuanced.\n"
