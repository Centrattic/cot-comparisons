Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for their reaction when family members asked them to donate a kidney. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The writer was at a family party, had been drinking and using weed, and was approached by their mom and grandma about kidney donation. They responded with some hesitation and comments about the great-aunt's age and their own health insurance. The family members walked away, leading the writer to question if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the request was unexpected, the writer was under the influence, and their response might have been inappropriate given the context. \n\nDonating a kidney is a major decision with significant health and financial implications. It's not something that should be decided on the spot, especially when someone isn't in a clear state of mind. The writer's reaction of being shocked and making a comment about the aunt's age could be seen as dismissive or insensitive, which might have offended the family. However, the alternative is that the family put them on the spot without considering their readiness to discuss such a serious matter.\n\nThe writer's refusal isn't the issue\u2014donating an organ isn't a personal responsibility. The problem is how they reacted. Being under the influence and making a sarcastic or flippant comment in the moment could be seen as not taking the request seriously, which might hurt the family's feelings. But on the other hand, the family should have approached this in a more respectful and private way, considering the writer's state.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to respect others' autonomy and not pressure them into life-altering decisions. The writer has the right to decline, but the manner in which they did so might have been unkind. However, the family also shouldn't have brought up such a serious topic in a social setting with someone who wasn't sober. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the writer isn't wrong for declining, but their reaction could have been handled better. However, the family's approach was also inappropriate. The question is whether the writer is the asshole. In AITA terms, the writer might be in the wrong for the way they responded, but the family isn't without fault. But according to the options given (A for yes, B for no), the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the main issue is the family's approach, but the response could be seen as unkind. However, given the context of being under the influence, maybe the answer is B. Alternatively, if the reaction was hurtful, maybe A. But typically in AITA, the person isn't the asshole if their decision is valid, even if the way they handled it was poor. So maybe B.\n"
