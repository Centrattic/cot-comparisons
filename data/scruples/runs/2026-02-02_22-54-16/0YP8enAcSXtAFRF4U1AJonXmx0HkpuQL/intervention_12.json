Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and they reacted in a way that upset their family, particularly their grandma. The author is wondering if their reaction was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had taken a dab of weed. During the conversation, the grandma brought up the idea of the author donating a kidney to their great-aunt, offering $25,000. The author responded with hesitation and concern about the aunt's age and their own health insurance. The grandma then walked away, and the author feels bad about how they handled it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Now, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\n1. **Context of the Conversation**: The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which might have affected their composure. While being in a different state of mind isn't an excuse for being rude, it's a factor that might explain their reaction.\n\n2. **Nature of the Request**: Donating a kidney is a major decision. The author's concerns about health insurance and financial burden are valid. The offer of $25,000 might seem like a payment for the donation, but in reality, kidney donations are typically not paid for ethically. The fact that the family is offering money could indicate a problematic approach, possibly seeing the author as a resource rather than considering their well-being.\n\n3. **Author's Response**: The author's initial reaction was to question the aunt's age and their own health insurance. This is a reasonable concern. The author didn't outright refuse but expressed valid worries. However, the tone might have been perceived as dismissive or uncooperative, especially given the grandma's reaction.\n\n4. **Family Reactions**: The grandma walked away, indicating she was hurt. The author is now worried they upset her. However, the pressure to donate an organ without proper consideration of the author's feelings and circumstances is a significant issue. The family's expectation that the author should comply without hesitation might be unrealistic.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: The author has the right to refuse organ donation. The family's approach, especially offering money, could be ethically questionable. The author's hesitation is justified, and their reaction, while perhaps not perfect in delivery, is understandable under the circumstances.\n\n6. **Communication Issues**: The author might have been more direct or calm in their response. However, given the stress and the nature of the request, their reaction is not necessarily wrong. The family's lack of prior discussion about this request is also a point to consider. Bringing up such a life-changing decision in a party setting, especially when the person is under the influence, is not appropriate.\n\nPutting this all together, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to donate and expressing concerns. The family's approach was flawed, and the author's response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, is justified. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
