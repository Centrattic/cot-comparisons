Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was at a family party, probably in a relaxed state, having some weed, and then their grandma suddenly suggests they donate a kidney to a great-aunt they don't know well. The author responds with a bit of confusion, mentions the aunt's age, the financial aspect of their own health insurance, and that they're too high to handle the conversation. The mom and grandma then stop talking to them for the rest of the night, and the author feels bad about how they handled it but not about the decision itself.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author is being asked to make a major, life-altering decision on the spot, especially when they're under the influence. The family offered money, which might raise some ethical questions\u2014should someone be paid to donate an organ? But in some contexts, people do receive compensation for things like plasma donations, though kidney donations are usually altruistic. However, the author's main issue is the way they reacted, not the decision itself.\n\nThe author's response was to question the age of the recipient and their own financial risks. They also stated they're too high to have that conversation. The mom and grandma were upset. But is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is not obligated to donate an organ. They have the right to say no, and to express their concerns. The problem here is the timing and the context\u2014being under the influence and a party setting isn't the right time for such a serious conversation. However, the author had the right to voice their discomfort and refusal. The way they reacted might have been blunt, but given the circumstances (being high, unexpected request), it's understandable. The family could have approached the topic more sensitively, perhaps after discussing it more thoroughly with the author in a sober, appropriate setting. The author isn't in the wrong because they're not responsible for the family's expectations or the way the conversation was presented. Their response was honest, and they clearly communicated their reasons for declining.\n"
