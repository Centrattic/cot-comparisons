Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 26-year-old woman at a family party, where she's tipsy and just smoked weed. Her mom and grandma bring up the topic of her donating a kidney to her great-aunt, who's in her late 70s. They even offer $25,000. The author responds by saying the aunt is kind of old and mentions her insurance concerns. Then her grandma walks away, and they don't talk to her the rest of the night. She's wondering if she was an a**hole for reacting that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author wasn't in a good state to have a serious conversation\u2014she was under the influence of both alcohol and weed. That's a key point. People make uninformed or inappropriate comments when they're not sober, so it's understandable she might not have handled it well. But was her reaction in the wrong?\n\nShe expressed hesitation about donating a kidney, which is a major surgery. Mentioning insurance issues is a valid concern. The financial compensation part is interesting. Legally, you can't sell a kidney in the US, so offering $25k might be a way to cover costs, but it's still a sensitive topic. The author's mom and grandma might have thought the money was a way to encourage her, but bringing it up could have seemed like a bribe or downplayed the seriousness of the donation.\n\nThe author's response was a bit dismissive when she said, \"isn't she kind of old?\" But she was stoned. Maybe she was trying to deflect or not fully grasping the gravity herself. Then she states her insurance concerns and admits she's too high. Her grandma walked away, which indicates being upset. The author feels bad about making them upset, even though she's not willing to donate.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, donating a kidney is a huge decision. The family approached her in a situation where she wasn't in a good mental state. She's under no obligation to donate, even to a relative. Her right to make her own medical decisions is important. The way she reacted might have been unkind or unthoughtful because of being under the influence, but the core issue is about her autonomy. The family's pressure could be seen as inappropriate, especially bringing up money. The author's honest (if blunt) response about her state and concerns is a valid reaction, even if delivered poorly.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She has the right to refuse, and her state affects her ability to engage properly. The family's approach might be questionable too, especially the financial incentive. While her tone could have been better, the main issue is the pressure on a personal decision.\n"
