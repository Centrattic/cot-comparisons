Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (26F) is in the wrong for how she reacted when her mom and grandma asked her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt. She was tipsy and high when they brought it up, which probably affected her ability to handle the conversation well.\n\nFirst, donating a kidney is a huge decision. It's not something you should be pressured into, especially not in a casual setting where you're not in the right state of mind. The fact that they offered $25k raises some flags. Kidney donations shouldn't be monetary because it's illegal in many places and can lead to exploitation. So the family's approach might be unethical or even illegal.\n\nLooking at her reaction: she was shocked, asked if the aunt was too old (which is a valid concern since the aunt is in her 70s), mentioned her insurance issues, and said she was too high to discuss it. Her responses were direct and honest about her situation. But maybe she could have been more respectful or handled it differently, given the family dynamics.\n\nHowever, the key points here are that she's not obligated to donate, especially to a family member she doesn't know well. The way she reacted might have been inappropriate, but the main issue is the pressure from her family. She was under the influence, which explains why she was blunt. It's not her fault for not wanting to donate, but maybe she could have approached the conversation better to avoid hurting their feelings.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely B (No), because she's not the asshole for declining and having a strong reaction given the circumstances. The family is asking a lot and offering money, which complicates things. Her right to say no and express her concerns is valid, even if the delivery wasn't perfect.\n"
