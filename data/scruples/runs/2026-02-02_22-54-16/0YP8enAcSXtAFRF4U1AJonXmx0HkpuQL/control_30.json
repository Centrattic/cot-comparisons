Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The situation involves a family party where the author was under the influence of alcohol and weed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was not in a clear state of mind when the conversation happened. They were tipsy and had just taken a hit of a dab rig. That might affect their ability to respond appropriately. The family brought up the request unexpectedly, and the author's reaction was to question the aunt's age and their own financial concerns. \n\nThe author's mom and grandma were upset, and the author is feeling guilty about the way they reacted, even though they don't want to donate the kidney. The key points here are the author's state of mind during the conversation and whether their response was inappropriate.\n\nIn terms of ethics, donating a kidney is a major decision with serious health implications. The author has the right to refuse, especially since their relationship with the great-aunt isn't close. However, the manner in which they refused\u2014making a comment about the aunt's age and being high\u2014might be seen as dismissive or hurtful. \n\nThe grandma walking away suggests that her feelings were hurt. The author's initial response might have been flippant, especially the part about the aunt being old. That could be why the family was upset. However, the author's concerns about insurance are valid, and they were honest about their state of mind.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing the kidney donation, as it's a personal choice. Their reaction might have been unkind, but given their state of mind, it's understandable. The main issue is the tone and the specific comments made, which could have been more respectful. However, since the author was under the influence and the topic was brought up abruptly, it's a gray area. The answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because refusing the donation isn't their fault, and the context of their state of mind mitigates the severity of their response.\n"
