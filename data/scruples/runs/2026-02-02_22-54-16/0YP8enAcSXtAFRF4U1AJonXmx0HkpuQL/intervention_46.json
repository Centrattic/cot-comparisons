Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they reacted to their family asking them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. \n\nFirst, the context: the author was at a family party, tipsy and had just smoked weed. They don't have a close relationship with the great-aunt, who isn't a significant part of their life. The family offered $25k for the donation, which might be a point to consider. \n\nThe author's response was to question the aunt's age and mention their insurance concerns. The grandma walked away, and the author feels bad for upsetting their mom and grandma. They know they don't have to donate, but are worried about their reaction.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, donating a kidney is a big decision. The family brought it up during a social event where the author was under the influence. The author's response was honest about their state and health concerns. They didn't say yes, which is understandable given the personal and financial risks. \n\nThe grandma's reaction of walking away might be a sign of being hurt, but the author's initial question about the aunt's age could come off as dismissive or insensitive. However, considering the context (tipsy, not a close relationship), it's possible the author was just trying to be realistic. The mention of insurance is valid because medical costs can be overwhelming without proper coverage. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a family matter where the author is not obligated to donate. The way they reacted might have been abrupt, but given the circumstances, they were probably not in a good state to handle a serious conversation. The key point is that the author is not the one who asked for the kidney; they were being pressured by their family. They expressed their concerns, even if it might have been blunt. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing and stating their concerns, even if the timing and tone were awkward. They have the right to prioritize their health and financial stability, especially when the relationship isn't close. The family should have approached this more sensitively and at a better time.\n"
