Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had smoked weed not long before. Their mom and grandma brought up the topic of donating a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was shocked and responded in a way that made their family upset. The author now feels bad about their reaction, even though they don't want to donate the kidney.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was under the influence, the topic came up suddenly, the author expressed their concerns about health insurance and not being in the right state of mind. The family then distanced themselves. The author is questioning if their reaction was wrong.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was inappropriate. They were in a state of being tipsy and high, which might affect their ability to handle a serious conversation. They voiced their concerns about financial risks and their current state. But maybe the way they said it was dismissive or hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the family brought up a serious medical decision in a social setting without prior discussion. The offer of $25k might also complicate things, possibly implying an expectation. The author's hesitation is understandable because donating a kidney is a major decision, and they need to consider their own health and financial stability.\n\nThe author's reaction included making a joke about the aunt's age and mentioning their high state. That might have been seen as flippant. However, under the influence, their judgment was impaired. Also, the financial offer could be seen as a bribe, which is a red flag in organ donation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't obligated to donate. The way they reacted might have been abrupt, but the context of their state and the suddenness of the request could mitigate that. The family's approach might have been insensitive, bringing up such a serious topic without prior discussion, especially in a social setting.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's reaction was in self-defense, expressing their discomfort and concerns. They were not in the right state to discuss it, and their response was honest. The family might have been overreaching in their approach. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
