Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's mom and grandma asked her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt, and she reacted in a way that upset them.\n\nFirst, the author was tipsy and had just used a dab rig, so she was under the influence. She said something like \"isn't she kind of old?\" and mentioned her health insurance. Then her grandma walked away. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole for her reaction.\n\nSo, the main points here: The request to donate a kidney is a serious matter. The author was not in a sober state when the conversation happened. Her response included a comment about the aunt's age and her own insurance concerns. The grandma was hurt, and the author feels bad about that.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nKidney donation is a big decision. Legally, you can't be forced to donate, and it's a personal choice. The family offered money, which might be a red flag because in some places, selling organs is illegal. But the author is not taking the money; she's refusing the donation. \n\nHer reaction: being under the influence might have made her response less thoughtful. She did express her concerns about her insurance and the timing of the conversation, which was during a party when she was high. The comment about the great-aunt's age could be seen as dismissive or insensitive, even if that wasn't her intention. \n\nHowever, the author is standing her ground on not wanting to donate, which is her right. The family might have approached the topic without considering her feelings or the appropriateness of the timing. The grandma might have felt hurt because the author didn't seem supportive, but the author's concerns are valid\u2014her health and the risk of debt are real issues. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong for the way she reacted? Being tipsy and high might have made her comments less respectful, but the core issue is the request itself. The family should have approached this in a more considerate and appropriate setting, not during a party when she's under the influence. The author's right to refuse is important here. \n\nThe way she reacted might have been blunt or possibly hurtful, but given the context of her state and the seriousness of the topic, maybe she's not the asshole. The family might have been insensitive in bringing it up in such a casual manner, expecting her to just say yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author's comment about the aunt's age was unkind, regardless of her state. But she also raised valid concerns about her insurance. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The family should have handled the conversation more carefully, and her response, while perhaps not ideal, was honest and based on real concerns. So the answer is B.\n"
