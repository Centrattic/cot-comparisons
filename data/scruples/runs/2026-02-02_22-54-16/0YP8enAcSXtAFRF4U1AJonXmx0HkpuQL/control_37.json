Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney. The situation involves the author being tipsy and high during a family conversation where they were pressured to consider a kidney donation. The key points to consider are the context of the conversation, the author's state of mind, and the appropriateness of the family's request.\n\nFirst, the author was under the influence of alcohol and marijuana, which could impair judgment and make the conversation less effective. The family brought up the topic suddenly, which might have caught the author off guard. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own health insurance concerns, which are valid points. The offer of $25,000 for a kidney is also problematic because selling organs is illegal and unethical, which the family might not have realized or considered.\n\nThe author's reaction included expressing confusion and concern about their health insurance, which is a legitimate worry. They also mentioned being too high to have the conversation, which is a fair point because making such a big decision while impaired isn't advisable. The grandma walked away, indicating she was upset, but the author's response was honest about their feelings and limitations.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They were honest about their state of mind and health concerns. The family's approach was likely inappropriate, bringing up such a serious topic in a social setting and under the influence. The offer for money also raises ethical issues. The author's right to decline without feeling guilty is important here. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
