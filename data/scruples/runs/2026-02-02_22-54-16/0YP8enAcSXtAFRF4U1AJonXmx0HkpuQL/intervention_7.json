Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was at a party, tipsy and had just taken some weed. The conversation came out of nowhere, and the author's response was a bit abrupt and maybe not the most respectful. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author wasn't in a sober state, which might affect their judgment and how they communicated. Their family brought up the request suddenly, which can be a lot to process at any time, let alone when under the influence. The author's response about the aunt's age and their health insurance concerns are valid points. They're not wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and financial stability.\n\nBut the way they reacted\u2014saying \"isn't she kind of old?\" and then the grandma walking away\u2014might come off as dismissive or insensitive. The grandma might have felt hurt, especially if she was trying to be helpful or concerned. The author later acknowledges that they upset their grandma, which shows some awareness of the impact of their words.\n\nHowever, the core issue is the request itself. Donating a kidney is a huge decision, and it's not the author's responsibility to do so. They have the right to refuse, regardless of the financial incentive. The author's main mistake was reacting in the moment without considering the emotional impact on their family, especially under the influence. But that doesn't make them the \"asshole\" for saying no. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for declining the request, but the delivery could have been kinder. The answer should be B (No), because the author isn't the asshole for not donating and expressing their concerns, even if the delivery wasn't perfect.\n"
