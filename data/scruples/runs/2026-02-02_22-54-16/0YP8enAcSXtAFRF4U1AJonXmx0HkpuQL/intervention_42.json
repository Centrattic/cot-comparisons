Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney. The situation is that they were at a party, a bit tipsy and had smoked weed, when their mom and grandma suggested they donate a kidney to their great-aunt, offering $25k. The author responded with some confusion and concerns about their health insurance and being too high, which upset their mom and grandma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was under the influence of both alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. That can affect their judgment and ability to engage in serious discussions. But they did mention they were aware they weren't in the right state for such a conversation. The question is about whether their reaction was in the wrong.\n\nThe author's response was to question the age of the great-aunt and express concerns about their own health insurance. They also stated they were too high to have the conversation. The mom and grandma took offense, especially the grandma walking away. The author feels bad about how they reacted but isn't sure if they're in the wrong.\n\nI think the key points here are the influence of substances and the appropriateness of the request. Asking someone to donate an organ is a huge decision and should be discussed in a serious, sober setting. The fact that the author was under the influence might make their response seem flippant, but they did try to express their concerns. However, their initial reaction could have been more respectful. Saying \"isn't she kind of old?\" might come off as dismissive or insensitive, even if they were high. The author could have handled the conversation better by saying they weren't comfortable discussing it in their current state and maybe suggested talking later when they were more sober.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's approach might also be questionable. Suggesting a kidney donation at a party, especially without prior discussion, is a lot to drop on someone. The author wasn't the one to bring up the topic. They were caught off guard. The offer of money could also be seen as a financial incentive, which might complicate the ethical aspect of organ donation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't entirely at fault. They were in a situation where they were not in the right state, and the family might have handled the request inappropriately. However, their reaction could have been more respectful and less direct. They might not be in the wrong, but they could have approached the situation differently. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but with some nuance.\n"
