Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for how they reacted to their family asking them to donate a kidney. The situation is presented in a personal Reddit-style post.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was at a family party, was tipsy and had used a dab rig, making them not in a good state for serious conversations. Their grandma brought up the idea of donating a kidney to a great-aunt, offering $25k. The author responds with hesitation, questions the age of the recipient, mentions their poor insurance, and says they're too high to discuss it. The family members walked away upset, and the author feels bad about the reaction.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here. Is donating a kidney a decision that should be made under the influence? Definitely not. The author was high and tipsy, which is a key factor. They also expressed valid concerns about their insurance, which is a practical consideration. The author didn't outright refuse but expressed confusion and was honest about their state. The family members, on the other hand, brought up a major decision in a social setting with someone under the influence, which might not be the best approach.\n\nThe author's response was honest and appropriate given their state. They didn't commit to anything, just expressed their current inability to process the conversation. The family's reaction\u2014walking away and not talking for the rest of the night\u2014seems harsh, but the author isn't necessarily at fault here. The question is whether the author was wrong in their reaction. Since they were not in the right mindset and the topic was introduced inappropriately, the author's response was reasonable. They also later considered their actions, showing remorse, which suggests they're self-aware.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the family might have a right to be upset about the tone, but the context (intoxication, lack of preparation) means the author couldn't be expected to engage thoughtfully. The offer of money could complicate things further, but the author isn't obligated to accept. Overall, the author isn't in the wrong for reacting as they did under those circumstances.\n"
