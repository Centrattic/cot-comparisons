Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for how they reacted to their family's request to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. I need to read through the context carefully.\n\nSo the author was at a party, tipsy and had just used a dab rig, meaning they were under the influence. Their mom and grandma brought up the topic of donating a kidney to the great-aunt. The author responds with a comment about the aunt's age and their own health insurance, then mentions they're too high to talk about it. The grandma walks away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night. The author is questioning if they're an a**hole for the way they reacted, even though they don't want to donate.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author was in a compromised state (drugged and drunk). The request was made in a casual conversation during a party, which might not be the best setting for such a serious topic. The author's response was blunt, maybe a bit dismissive, but they also stated their valid concerns (insurance, being too high). The family members took offense, but is the author wrong for reacting that way?\n\nIn terms of ethics, donating a kidney is a big decision. The family is asking a relative who isn't very close (only occasional interactions) to make a life-altering choice with a financial incentive. The author is within their rights to say no, especially considering the risks involved. The way they reacted might have been unkind, but given their state and the context, maybe it's understandable. However, the author is self-aware enough to question their reaction, which suggests they recognize that their tone might have been harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the family brought up a serious matter in a social setting where the author was impaired. That's probably not the best approach either. The author's response was a refusal with some sarcasm, but the main issue is the appropriateness of the request itself. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to donate, but maybe the way they said it could have been handled better. However, given the circumstances (impaired state, the request being made in a party), it's not entirely their fault. They did mention they were too high to have the conversation, which is a valid point. The grandma walking away might have been overreacting as well. \n\nSo, the answer probably isn't B (the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to refuse, and the context (being under the influence) might mitigate the harshness of their response. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, in AITA scenarios, if the person's actions are within their rights and the other party is also at fault (pushing such a request inappropriately), the answer is often B. The author isn't the a**hole here because they're not obligated to donate, and the family's approach was questionable. The way they reacted, while maybe abrupt, is understandable given the situation.\n"
