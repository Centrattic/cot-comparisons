Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reacting the way she did when her family asked her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt.\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The author was at a family party, had been drinking alcohol and smoking weed, which affected her judgment. Her grandma brought up the request to donate a kidney, which was financially incentivized with $25k. The author's response was initially dismissive and made a joke about the aunt's age, then mentioned her insurance concerns and that she was too high. After that, her grandma walked away, and the family didn't talk to her the rest of the night.\n\nNow, considering the context. The author had no close relationship with the great-aunt, so the request isn't coming from someone she's close to. The request is significant\u2014organ donation is a major medical procedure with lifelong consequences. The financial incentive adds a layer of pressure or potential ethical issues, though the legality of paid organ donations varies by country. However, in many places, it's illegal, so the offer of $25k might be problematic.\n\nHer reaction: She was under the influence, which might have affected her ability to handle a serious conversation. She made a joke about the aunt's age, which could be seen as insensitive. Then she brought up her insurance concerns, which are valid but maybe not the best approach in the moment. Also, stating she was too high might come off as dismissive or disrespectful.\n\nBut considering her state at the time, being under the influence might mitigate the bluntness of her response. She's also asserting her own health and financial boundaries, which is important. The way she reacted, while maybe not the most tactful, is understandable given the unexpected and high-stakes nature of the request in an inappropriate setting (a party, while under the influence).\n\nThe grandma's reaction of walking away suggests that the conversation was not handled well, but the author's refusal isn't the issue\u2014it's her manner. However, given the circumstances (intoxicated, unexpected request, financial incentive), it's debatable whether she's the asshole for not handling it more diplomatically in that moment.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to donate a kidney, and while her reaction could have been better, the context of being under the influence and the inappropriate timing of the conversation makes her reaction understandable. The real issue might be the family's approach in bringing up such a serious request in a casual, influenced setting.\n"
