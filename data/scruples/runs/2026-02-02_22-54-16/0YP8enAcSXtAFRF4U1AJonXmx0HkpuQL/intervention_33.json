Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for their reaction when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was at a family party, tipsy and had just used a dab rig (weed), so they were not in a clear state of mind. Their mom and grandma brought up the topic of the great-aunt needing a kidney, and the author responded with shock and some hesitant comments. They mentioned their insurance being bad and not wanting to be in debt, and also said they were too high to discuss it. Then the grandma walked away, and the rest of the night was awkward. The author is unsure if their reaction was wrong, even though they don't plan to donate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user's opinion is that the author is not in the wrong, but they want validation or another perspective.\n\nLet me consider the key points. The author was under the influence, which is important because it's a party setting and their family is aware (they smoke weed often). They were asked to donate a kidney on the spot, which is a huge decision. The author's response was to question the age of the great-aunt and their own health insurance, which are valid concerns. They also pointed out they were not in the right state for such a serious conversation, which makes sense. The grandma then walked away, indicating possible hurt feelings.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't obligated to donate an organ, even to a family member. The offer of $25k is also a red flag because organ donation should not be for money; it's illegal in many places and considered unethical. The author's hesitation is understandable. Also, being under the influence doesn't mean they deserve criticism for a blunt response. The family might have approached the topic inconsiderately, given the author's state. The author's concerns about their insurance and financial burden are practical and responsible, which shows they're thinking about their own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's initial reaction was abrupt. They might have come off as dismissive or unemotional. However, considering the context (tipsy, not serious conversation, sudden and unexpected request), their response is justified. They didn't say 'no' outright but expressed their inability to engage in the discussion properly. The grandma's reaction could also be influenced by her own stress or expectations about the situation.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They handled a difficult and unexpected request as best as they could under the circumstances. Their concerns are valid, and the family should have approached the topic with more sensitivity. The answer is B.\n"
