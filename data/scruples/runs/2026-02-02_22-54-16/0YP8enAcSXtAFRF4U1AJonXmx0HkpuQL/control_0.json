Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt by their mom and grandma during a family party. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when this conversation happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a relaxed setting, not in a serious state of mind. They didn't know their great-aunt well, and the request came out of the blue. The offer of $25k is mentioned, which might be relevant. The author's initial reaction was to question the aunt's age and their own insurance issues, which seems like a valid concern. They also mentioned being too high to discuss it, which shows they were aware of their state.\n\nNow, the question is whether their reaction was wrong. The author didn't outright refuse immediately. They asked questions and expressed concerns. However, the grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. The author is questioning if they were in the wrong for the way they reacted.\n\nPossible points to consider: Was the author respectful? They did ask questions and didn't say no immediately. They also stated their health concerns, which are legitimate. The fact that they were under the influence might have affected their response, but it doesn't necessarily make it wrong. Family dynamics play a role here. The author might feel pressured, and their reaction was a way to set boundaries. On the other hand, the family might have expected more consideration or a different approach.\n\nThe offer of $25k could be seen as payment for the donation, which might be ethically questionable, but that's more about the family's decision. The author's right to refuse is a key point. The way they reacted includes being honest about their state and concerns, which seems reasonable. They didn't lash out but rather expressed confusion and worry. So, considering all that, the author's response was within their rights and not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
