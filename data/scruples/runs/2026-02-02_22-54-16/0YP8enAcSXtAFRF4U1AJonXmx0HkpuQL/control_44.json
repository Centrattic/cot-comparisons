Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt and how they reacted.\n\nFirst, the author was at a party, tipsy and had just used a dab rig, so not in a serious state of mind. The grandma brought up the idea of kidney donation, and the author responded with a question about the aunt's age and concerns about their insurance. Then the grandma walked away, and the author feels bad about their reaction.\n\nThe main points to consider are the appropriateness of the request and the reaction. Organ donation is a big decision, and the author is 26, not a close relative. The offer of $25k might be for expenses, but it's not legal to sell organs in the US. The author's response was blunt and maybe hurtful, but they were under the influence and in a social setting. They also raised valid concerns about their health insurance and the seriousness of the situation. \n\nGrandma's reaction was to walk away, which seems hurt. The author might be in the wrong for being dismissive, but the question of whether they should donate a kidney at all is another matter. The user is asking if the reaction was wrong, not the decision to not donate. The author's immediate response could have been handled more sensitively, even if they were high. \n\nBut the root issue is that bringing up a kidney donation in a casual, social setting while the person is under the influence isn't appropriate. The author's concerns are valid, and the way they expressed it, while maybe impolite, is understandable given the context. They clarified they weren't ready to discuss it seriously. The family members should have had that conversation in a more suitable, sober environment. So the author isn't in the wrong for their reaction, just perhaps could have been more diplomatic.\n"
