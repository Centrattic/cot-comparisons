Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and the response given was dismissive and maybe a bit rude, especially considering the context.\n\nFirst, the author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when the conversation happened. That's a key point because being impaired might affect how someone responds. They mention that it's normal in their household to use weed, so maybe the family is more accepting of that. However, discussing a serious medical decision while under the influence might not be appropriate.\n\nThe author's reaction included making a comment about the great-aunt's age and their own insurance issues. The line \"isn't she kind of old?\" could come off as insensitive or flippant, especially to someone who's family and in need. The mom's response tries to counter that by saying she's not too old, which shows the family's hope for her recovery. The author then brings up their own financial concerns, which is a valid point but perhaps not the best approach in that moment.\n\nGrandma walking away indicates she was hurt by the comment about age. The author later feels bad about the way they reacted, not necessarily the decision to not donate. The question is whether the reaction was wrong. \n\nFactors to consider: The author was impaired, which might affect their judgment and tone. However, the initial question was about donating a kidney, which is a major decision. The author had the right to say no, but the manner in which they did so might have been inconsiderate. The financial offer of $25k might add pressure, but the author isn't obligated to accept. \n\nThe key here is whether the response was disrespectful. The comment about age could be seen as dismissive and hurtful. Even if the author was high, being respectful in serious family matters is important. The author's concerns about insurance are valid, but bringing them up in that context without considering the emotional impact might have been part of the issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author did have the right to refuse the donation, but the way they expressed their refusal, especially the age comment, might have been inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is somewhat at fault for the tone and content of their response, but not for refusing to donate. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because the reaction was inappropriate given the circumstances.\n"
