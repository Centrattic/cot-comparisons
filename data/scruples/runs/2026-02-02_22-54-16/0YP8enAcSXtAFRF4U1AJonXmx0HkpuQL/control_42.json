Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about being asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, and the author's reaction. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was at a family party, was tipsy and had just smoked weed, which probably affected their judgment. The grandma brought up the request to donate a kidney, offering $25k. The author responded with a question about the aunt's age and their own health insurance concerns, and mentioned being too high. Then the grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to the author for the rest of the night.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is not in the wrong for refusing to donate a kidney. That's a personal choice, and people aren't obligated to donate organs unless they've signed up for that. But the question is about the reaction. \n\nThe author was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which might have affected their ability to have a mature conversation. However, they did express their concerns, even if in a shocked and perhaps dismissive way. The grandma's request was sudden, and the author's response was honest about their state of mind and the risks involved. \n\nThe author might have handled it better, maybe by saying they needed to think about it or speak to someone, but their reaction was in the moment and under the influence. The grandma walked away, which might indicate she was upset by the author's tone or question, but the author's response was straightforward. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't obligated to agree, and the way they reacted, while perhaps abrupt, was honest. The family should have considered the author's state of mind and the suddenness of the request. So the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
