Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user, a 26-year-old female, was at a family party where her mom and grandma asked her to donate a kidney to her great-aunt. She was under the influence of alcohol and weed, which probably affected her judgment and ability to have a serious conversation. She responded with some hesitation, mentioning the aunt's age and her own insurance issues. Her grandma walked away, and the family didn't talk to her for the rest of the night. She's feeling guilty about her reaction and is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the context of the conversation, the state of the person when the conversation happened, and the actual content of the response. The person was not in the right state of mind, which is important. The request to donate a kidney is a major, life-altering decision that should be made carefully. Asking someone in a compromised state (under the influence) is inappropriate. The person's response was to question the age and their own insurance, which seems reasonable given the circumstances. The grandma's reaction was to walk away, which might indicate she was upset, but the initial request was made in a context that wasn't conducive to a thoughtful discussion.\n\nThe user is feeling like they're in the wrong for how they reacted. But considering they were under the influence, it's understandable they might not have handled it perfectly. However, the main issue here is the family's approach. They brought up a serious medical decision in a casual setting where the person wasn't sober. The user's response, while maybe not the most tactful, was honest and raised valid concerns. The financial incentive (25k) also adds a layer of complexity, as organ donation shouldn't be about money.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the family members should have approached the situation more thoughtfully, ensuring the person was in a suitable state to discuss such a major decision. The user, while perhaps not handling it perfectly, isn't in the wrong given the context. The main fault lies with the family for making the request during a party when the person was under the influence and not in a position to give a considered response.\n"
