Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked for a kidney donation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was at a family party, a bit tipsy and had used weed. The conversation turned serious when grandma asked if the author would donate a kidney to the great-aunt. The author responded with a comment about the aunt's age and their own health insurance issues, then mentioned they were too high for the conversation. The mom and grandma were upset and didn't talk to them the rest of the night.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author was under the influence, which might affect their judgment and tone. But they were honest about their feelings. The family's request was sudden and serious, especially given the author's current state. The author had a right to express their discomfort and concerns. However, the way they phrased it\u2014saying the aunt was \"kind of old\"\u2014might have been dismissive or insensitive. The grandma walking away suggests she felt disrespected.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, you can't be forced to donate an organ, even to a relative. The offer of $25k is problematic because in the US, selling organs is illegal. So the family's approach might have been unethical.\n\nThe author's reaction, while maybe not the most tactful, was about expressing refusal. They were honest about their state of mind and concerns. The family's reaction might be harsh, but the author isn't obligated to comply. The question is about being in the wrong for the reaction. The author's response was a bit off-hand (\"isn't she kind of old?\") but given the situation and their state, it's understandable. The core issue is the refusal, which isn't the author's fault. The way they reacted might have been abrupt, but considering the circumstances, it's not necessarily wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
