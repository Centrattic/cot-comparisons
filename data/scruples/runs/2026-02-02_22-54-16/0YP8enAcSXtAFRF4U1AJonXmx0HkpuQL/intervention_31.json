Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their family asked them to donate a kidney to their great-aunt. The author was tipsy and had just smoked weed, which might have affected their judgment. They were caught off guard by the request, which is a big deal. The family offered $25k, which complicates things because it's not just a matter of altruism.\n\nFirst, the author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own health insurance. That seems like a reasonable concern. People have the right to be cautious about their health and financial stability. The author also mentioned they were not in the right state of mind, which might explain why their response was blunt. However, the grandmother walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them for the rest of the night. The author feels bad about hurting their feelings but isn't sure if they were in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the conversation (impromptu, under the influence), the significant request (organ donation), the financial aspect, and the emotional reactions. Organ donation is a huge decision, and the author rightly points out the risks and financial burden involved. The family's approach seems a bit abrupt, especially given the lack of a close relationship with the great-aunt. The fact that money is involved could be seen as problematic, as it might influence the decision inappropriately. \n\nThe author's reaction, while maybe not the most tactful in the moment, was honest and highlighted valid concerns. They didn't lash out or be disrespectful; they expressed hesitation and pointed out practical issues. The grandmother's reaction was to walk away, which suggests she was more upset by the refusal than the tone. In such sensitive situations, approaching the topic when everyone is sober and prepared for a serious discussion is important. The author's state of mind (tipsy and high) wasn't ideal, but they did voice their concerns upfront. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to be cautious and express their hesitation. The family should have approached the topic more sensitively and not sprung it on them in a casual, party setting under the influence. The author's response was honest and appropriate given the circumstances.\n"
