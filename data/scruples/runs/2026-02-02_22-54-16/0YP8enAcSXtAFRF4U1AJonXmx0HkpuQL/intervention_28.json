Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (26F) is wrong for how they reacted when their family asked for a kidney donation. They were at a party, a bit tipsy and high, and the conversation came up. The family suggested the kidney donation with $25k, and the person responded with shock and sarcasm (\"isn't she kind of old?\") and mentioned their health insurance and being high. The mom and grandma then ignored them for the rest of the night.\n\nFirst, the author is being asked to donate a kidney, which is a major medical decision. It's not a trivial request. The author is not obligated to do this. The family offered money, which might be a red flag, but maybe they're trying to cover costs. However, the author is within their rights to decline. \n\nThe reaction: the author was under the influence, which might have affected their judgment. But they were honest about their state and their reasons for not wanting to. The sarcastic comment about the aunt's age was probably hurtful, but given the context of being high and stressed, it might be understandable for a spontaneous reaction. The author also mentioned their health insurance concerns, which is a valid point about the risks involved.\n\nThe family's response was to walk away and ignore them, which suggests they were upset. The author is feeling guilty about the way they reacted, not the decision itself. The key point is whether the reaction was inappropriate. The author wasn't aggressive, just expressed their stance in a way that might have come off as dismissive or flippant. However, given the circumstances (being high, the suddenness of the request), it's a natural response. They didn't lash out or yell, just made a joke and stated their concerns.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not donating, and the reaction, while perhaps unthoughtful, doesn't make them an asshole. The family's expectations might be unrealistic, and the author is allowed to prioritize their own health and financial security. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
