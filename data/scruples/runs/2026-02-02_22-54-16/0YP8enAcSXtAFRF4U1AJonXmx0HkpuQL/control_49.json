Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was asked to donate a kidney to their great-aunt by their mom and grandma during a family party. The author was under the influence of alcohol and weed when this happened. They responded with a question about the aunt's age and their own health insurance issues, and then their grandma walked away, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was not in a clear state of mind due to being tipsy and having used weed. That might affect their ability to engage in a serious conversation. The request to donate a kidney is a huge decision with medical, emotional, and financial implications. The family members brought it up suddenly during a social gathering, which might not be the best time for such a discussion.\n\nThe author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own financial concerns. That seems like a reasonable reaction because they are expressing valid concerns about the risks involved. The monetary aspect (getting $25k) might be a factor, but the main issue here is the right to make such a personal decision without pressure.\n\nThe grandma walked away, showing that she was hurt. However, the author didn't outright refuse immediately; they asked questions. Maybe the grandma expected a more respectful way of declining. But considering the author's state of mind and the suddenness of the request, their reaction might be understandable. \n\nAlso, the author isn't obligated to donate an organ, especially to a relative they don't have a close relationship with. The fact that they didn't say \"no\" but instead asked questions could be seen as trying to engage in dialogue, even if it was awkward. The family's reaction to not talk to them for the rest of the night seems harsh, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing their ground.\n\nIn summary, while the author's delivery might have been abrupt, their concerns are valid, and the situation was not ideal for such a serious conversation. The family might share some responsibility for bringing up the topic during a party and not approaching it more sensitively. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
