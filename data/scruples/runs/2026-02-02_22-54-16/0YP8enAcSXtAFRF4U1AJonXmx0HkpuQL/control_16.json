Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their reaction when family asked them to donate a kidney.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was at a party, had been drinking and smoking weed, which affected their judgment. The family members brought up the request in the middle of a social gathering, not a serious discussion. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and express concern about their health insurance, plus mention being too high. The grandma walked away, and the mom and grandma didn't talk to them the rest of the night.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The key points here are consent and context. Organ donation is a major decision that shouldn't be made under pressure or in a compromised mental state. The family approached the author in a party setting, which isn't appropriate for such a serious topic. The author's reaction was to express hesitation and practical concerns, which is reasonable. They also mentioned not being in the right state of mind, which is valid given their intoxication.\n\nThe grandma's immediate walkaway suggests they were caught off guard by the author's response. The offer of $25k might complicate things, as payment for organs is illegal in many places, but the family is still pushing for a donation. The author's refusal, especially under the circumstances, isn't unreasonable. They have a right to prioritize their own health and financial stability.\n\nThe author is questioning if they were an asshole for their reaction. The reaction was direct but not disrespectful. They didn't outright refuse without considering, but raised valid concerns. The family's approach was likely abrupt and possibly insensitive, given the setting and the author's state.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The family may have mishandled the situation, and the author's response was honest and appropriate given their state and the context. The answer should be B.\n"
