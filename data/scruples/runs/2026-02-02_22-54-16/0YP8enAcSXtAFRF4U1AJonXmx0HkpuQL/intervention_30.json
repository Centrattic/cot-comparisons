Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author, a 26-year-old woman, was at a family party where her mom and grandma brought up the topic of donating a kidney to her great-aunt. The aunt is in her late 70s and has been ill on and off for years. The author was tipsy and had just taken weed, so she wasn't in the best mental state. She responded with a question about the aunt's age and mentioned her insurance concerns, then said she was too high to discuss it. Her grandma walked away, and they didn't talk to her the rest of the night. The author is now wondering if she's the asshole for reacting that way, even though she's sure she's not wrong for not wanting to donate.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points: the request for a kidney donation, the author's state of mind, and her response. Kidney donation is a major medical decision with significant risks. The author is not close to the great-aunt, so the emotional connection might be lower. The fact that her family offered $25k is important. In many places, paying for organ donations is illegal, as it's considered a form of human trafficking. So the family's offer might be against the law, which the author might not have realized, but the family definitely shouldn't be offering money for a kidney.\n\nThe author's reaction: she was shocked and made a sarcastic or humorous comment about the aunt's age, then raised practical concerns about her insurance and her current state. Then she said she's too high to talk. The grandma walked away, which the author feels upsets her. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, organ donation is a serious matter, and bringing it up at a party while the person is under the influence is not appropriate. The family members should have approached this in a more respectful and sober setting. The author's response was direct and honest about her state of mind and her concerns. She didn't commit to anything and made it clear she wasn't ready to discuss it. Also, the financial incentive is problematic. The author is not obligated to donate an organ, especially to a distant relative she's not close to. \n\nHowever, maybe the way she phrased her response could have been more tactful. Saying \"isn't she kind of old?\" might come off as dismissive or insensitive, depending on how it's said. But given her state, it's understandable she was flustered. The main issue here is the family's approach: pressuring her in a social setting where she's not in the right frame of mind, and offering money, which is against the law in many cases. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for declining the donation or for expressing her concerns. The family is in the wrong for the manner in which they approached her, especially under the influence. So the answer should be B.\n"
