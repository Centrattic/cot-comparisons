Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for how they reacted when family asked them to donate a kidney. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author is at a family party, tipsy and high. Their grandma brings up the idea of donating a kidney to a great-aunt, offering $25k. The author responds with hesitation, mentions their insurance issues and being too high for the conversation. The family then ignores them the rest of the night.\n\nThe key points here are consent, mental state, and the pressure involved. The author was under the influence, which might have impaired their judgment. They also mentioned that they don't have a close relationship with the great-aunt. The offer of money complicates things because organ donation shouldn't be incentivized with cash, which is illegal in many places. \n\nThe author's response was to question the appropriateness of the request given their health insurance and state of mind. They didn't outright refuse immediately but expressed concerns. The family's reaction was to withdraw, which could be seen as holding the author accountable for not being more supportive.\n\nBut considering the author's state when the conversation happened, they might not have been in a good position to make such a serious decision. Also, the monetary incentive is problematic. The author isn't obligated to donate, especially since their relationship with the recipient isn't close. The way they reacted, while maybe blunt, was honest about their state and concerns. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to set boundaries and express their limits. The family might need to reflect on how they approached such a sensitive topic in a social setting, especially given the author's condition at the time.\n"
