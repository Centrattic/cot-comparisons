Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they were asked to donate a kidney to a great-aunt, which is a big decision. They were under the influence of alcohol and weed when this conversation happened, which probably affected their judgment. \n\nFirst, the author reacted with a comment about the great-aunt's age, saying \"isn't she kind of old?\" That might come off as dismissive or insensitive, especially to the grandmother who was advocating for the aunt. Then the author brought up their own health insurance concerns, which is a valid point but maybe not the best way to approach the conversation while impaired.\n\nThe mom's response about the aunt living longer is a hopeful take, but the author's reply focused on their own potential financial issues. Also, the author admitted they were too high to handle a serious conversation. This shows they weren't in the right state to make such a big decision. \n\nThe grandmother walked away, and the author feels bad about the way they reacted. The key points here are that the donation request is a major commitment, and the author was not in a clear state of mind to discuss it. Plus, the way they responded might have been hurtful, especially bringing up the aunt's age. \n\nHowever, the author isn't wrong for not wanting to donate their kidney. They have the right to say no, especially considering the risks and their own health. The problem is more about the manner of the response rather than the refusal itself. Since they were under the influence and the conversation was handled poorly, the author might be in the right for not being the asshole here. So, probably answer B.\n"
