Full disclosure, I was tipsy and on top of that had just taken a hit of a dab rig (weed) less than 5 minutes before this happened so I was definitely not in the right state of mind for serious conversation. Don't worry that's normal at my house, I smoke weed with my mom pretty often.\n\nMy mom and grandma start the conversation off talking about my great-aunt who has been ill on an off for the past few years. I don't really know her that well, growing up she would send me and my siblings small Christmas presents and every few years we'd get lunch together with my mom and grandma but it's safe to say she is not part of my life in a meaningful way. \n\nOut of nowhere my grandma slips it in to the conversation that  she wants me (26F) to get tested to see if I might be a match for my great-aunt (late 70s) so I can donate a kidney. They would give me $25,000 if I agree. I stood there shocked for a moment before I managed my reply, \n\nMe: Umm... isn't she kind of old? \n\nMom: Not that old! With a new kidney she could live to be 90 or even 100! \n\nMe: My health insurance is crap, if there are any post surgical problems I would be in debt the rest of my life. And to be honest I am way too high to be having this conversation right now.\n\nGrandma: I'm going to walk away now. \n\nAfter this interaction my mom and grandma didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I can tell I upset my grandma very much. I know I'm not the asshole for not wanting to give up my kidney (definitely not doing that) but I feel like the asshole for the way I reacted. \n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their reaction when family asked them to donate a kidney to a great-aunt. The author was at a party, under the influence of alcohol and weed, and the conversation came up. They reacted with shock, made a comment about the aunt's age, mentioned their insurance issues, and said they were high. The mom and grandma then walked away and didn't talk to them the rest of the night. The author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was not in a clear state of mind when the conversation happened. They were tipsy and had just smoked weed. That might affect their ability to engage in a serious discussion. The family presented a major life decision\u2014organ donation\u2014without prior discussion, which is a big deal. The author's response was to question the aunt's age and their own financial concerns, which are valid points. Organ donation is a personal choice, and the author is under no obligation to do it, especially for someone they don't know well.\n\nThe family's approach seems sudden and perhaps insensitive. They offered money, which might be a red flag because organ donation should be altruistic, not for payment. The author's reaction, while maybe blunt, was a honest expression of their feelings and current state. They didn't commit to anything or say they would refuse outright, just expressed concerns. The family's reaction of walking away and cutting off conversation is also harsh.\n\nLegally, family can't force someone to donate an organ. Ethically, the decision should be voluntary. The author is within their rights to refuse. The way they reacted might not have been the most tactful, but given their state and the suddenness of the request, it's understandable. They're not in the wrong for setting boundaries and expressing their discomfort. So the answer is B.\n"
