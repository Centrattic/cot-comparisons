My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. They want a simple answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was giving out candy on Halloween. Teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF. They used a guilt-tripping approach, saying the dollar could feed a village. The author felt trapped, gave a dollar but then took it back because they found the approach sarcastic and manipulative.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author gave the dollar initially but then took it back. The main issue is whether taking back the donation is wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, the author had the right to withdraw their donation if they felt pressured or deceived. The teenagers' sarcastic tone might have made the author uncomfortable, leading them to snatch back the money. The author could argue that the donation wasn't made freely once they realized the approach was manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, once a donation is given, even if the donor is upset later, taking it back might not be appropriate. But in this case, the author took the money back before it was given to UNICEF through the kids. The donation was still in the author's control at that moment. So maybe it's not wrong to change their mind on the spot.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that the kids were taking advantage of the situation by guilt-tripping people. The author felt that the UNICEF representatives were using a manipulative tactic, which is why they decided to take back the money. The author might believe that the donation wasn't genuine if it was coerced, so retracting it isn't wrong.\n\nI should also consider the context of Halloween. It's a time when people are more open to donations, and sometimes the methods used might be exaggerated for effect. However, the author felt that the approach was inappropriate, leading to their reaction.\n\nSo, putting it all together. The author took back the donation because they felt pressured and the method was manipulative. Since the donation wasn't yet transferred to UNICEF and the author changed their mind, it's not necessarily wrong. The author had the right to decide their contribution at that moment. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
