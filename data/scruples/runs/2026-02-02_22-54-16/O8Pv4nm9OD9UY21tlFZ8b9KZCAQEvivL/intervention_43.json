My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation involves a Halloween scenario where the author gave out candy while their family was away. Teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author gave a dollar but then snatched it back, feeling that the approach was manipulative and not genuine. They admitted feeling guilty afterward but justified their actions due to the perceived exploitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they were approached unexpectedly by teenagers collecting for UNICEF. The teens used a manipulative tactic, emphasizing poor kids in other countries to pressure for a donation. The author felt trapped and gave a dollar out of obligation, then took it back when they realized the sarcasm and the questionable method. \n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the use of guilt-tripping by the teens and the author's reaction. The author's action of taking back the money might be seen as impolite or aggressive, but the context is important. They felt manipulated and decided to reclaim their money. The question is about whether the author overreacted or acted appropriately in that moment. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, donating to UNICEF is generally seen as a positive act, but the method of collection here was questionable. The teens' sarcastic remarks and the pressure tactic could be considered unethical. The author's reaction, while perhaps abrupt, was a response to feeling coerced. It's possible that the author is justified in their frustration, especially if they believe the collection method is exploitative. \n\nHowever, taking back the donation after giving it might be seen as a breach of trust or impolite. But given the circumstances, the author might argue that they were not given a choice and felt the need to reclaim their money. The key is whether the author's action was a reasonable response to perceived manipulation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, interrupting or snatching money isn't ideal, but the situation might have been a spur-of-the-moment reaction. The author's admission of feeling like an asshole later shows self-awareness, which could mitigate blame. \n\nSo, balancing the pressure tactics of the teens and the author's reaction, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The manipulation by the teens plays a significant role here. Therefore, the author's actions, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, are a response to a coercive situation.\n"
