My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author stayed home to hand out Halloween candy while their family went trick-or-treating. They mention they usually have a bowl of candy for kids to grab, and they love seeing the kids get full-sized candy bars. Then, two teenagers show up asking for donations for UNICEF, saying it's for poor kids in other countries who can't trick or treat. The author gives them a dollar but then takes it back when the teens are sarcastic about it, saying they could feed a village, and then compares it to the cost of local candy. The author feels bad but thinks UNICEF is guilt-tripping people.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nSo, what's the crux here? The key points are: the author gave a donation, then took it back when they felt the collectors were being sarcastic and using guilt. The author's actions were defensive, reacting to what they perceived as manipulation. \n\nPossible arguments for the author being wrong (A): Donations are voluntary, and once given, taking them back might be seen as aggressive. The UNICEF collection is a charitable effort, and the author's response was confrontational. The teens might have been doing their job, even if they were being sarcastic. The author could have just not donated without resorting to snatching the money back.\n\nArguments for the author not being wrong (B): The author felt pressured and used guilt by the collectors. The initial donation was under duress, so retracting it could be justified as correcting a mistake. The author's response was a reaction to what they saw as exploitation of the Halloween tradition for fundraising. The sarcastic comment might have been the catalyst for the author's frustration.\n\nLegally, taking back a donation after it's been given might not be possible, but ethically, it's more about the situation. The author's justification is that they felt tricked into giving more than they intended, especially since the candy cost pennies. They also mention that the collectors were teenagers, which adds context\u2014they might not have been the most professional in their approach.\n\nAnother angle: The author's right to refuse to donate in the first place. They could have declined the donation without giving, but once they gave, taking it back might be seen as a breach of social norms. However, if the donation was made under false pretenses (like the sarcasm implying the dollar isn't enough), maybe the author had a right to retract it.\n\nAlso, cultural context. UNICEF's Halloween collection is a known tradition, but if the author wasn't aware of that, they might have misunderstood the intent. The teens might have been trying to make a point about the disparity in donation amounts versus candy cost, but their method was off-putting.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions stem from feeling manipulated and reacting to what they saw as an unfair comparison. While the action of taking back the money is confrontational, the underlying reason could be seen as self-defense against perceived pressure. The key is whether the author was justified in feeling pressured and whether retracting the donation was a reasonable response. Since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and considering the context of feeling trapped and the sarcastic remark, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, it's a bit of a\u7070\u8272 area. But given the options, B seems plausible.\n"
