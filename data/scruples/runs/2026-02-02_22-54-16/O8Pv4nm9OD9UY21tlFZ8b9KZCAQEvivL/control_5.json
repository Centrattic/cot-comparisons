My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves Halloween when they stayed home to hand out candy. They were approached by teenagers asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The person felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back because they felt the request was manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author gave the dollar initially but felt tricked by the teens' sarcastic remark about feeding a village. They took back the money because they didn't want to support what they saw as a scam. But UNICEF is a legitimate charity, so maybe the teens were just using a tactic that the author didn't like. However, the author had the right to take back the donation if they felt misled. \n\nNext, the intent. The author didn't want to give money to a cause they didn't believe in at that moment. The teens' approach was aggressive and sarcastic, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's reaction was strong, but they weren't violent\u2014just took back the money. \n\nAlso, the author admitted feeling like an asshole, showing remorse. But their rationale is that the teens were exploiting a situation, making people feel guilty. The question is whether taking back the donation was wrong. \n\nLegally, once the dollar was given, it's theirs, but since they took it back immediately, maybe it's different. Ethically, if the donation was made under false pretenses, the author might not be in the wrong for retracting. However, UNICEF itself isn't a scam, so the teens might have been misrepresenting it, but the author can't know that. \n\nIn the end, the author's action was a reaction to feeling manipulated. It's debatable, but the answer might hinge on whether the donation was voluntary and if the author had the right to retract it. Since the money wasn't given to UNICEF directly and the teens' approach was questionable, the author might not be wrong. So answer B.\n"
