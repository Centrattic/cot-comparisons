My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking back a UNICEF donation after a negative interaction with some teenagers.\n\nFirst, the author was at home giving out Halloween candy. Parents went trick-or-treating, and the author stayed to hand out candy. The usual setup is a bowl of candy, which is good because the neighborhood is popular for Halloween. Then, some older trick-or-treaters come, ask for a donation for UNICEF. The author gives a dollar but feels pressured. The teens respond sarcastically, and the author takes back the dollar, gets angry, and slams the door. Now, the author feels bad but thinks the UNICEF kids are guilt-tripping people. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider a few things. First, the context. The author was in their home, giving out candy as a service. The UNICEF kids approached during this time. The author mentions that they gave a dollar because they only had that in their wallet. Then, the interaction turned negative when the teens mocked the donation. The author took back the dollar, which could be seen as rude or abrupt.\n\nNow, legal or ethical considerations. The author isn't legally obligated to give money. They were free to decline the donation. However, once they gave the dollar, taking it back might be seen as impolite. But the author felt pressured and lied, which is a common criticism. The sarcastic comment from the teens might have crossed a line, making the author feel they were being manipulated. In such cases, people might feel justified in retracting their donation if they realize they were being manipulated or lied to.\n\nAnother angle is the right of the author to refuse their donation. Once a donation is given, the donor can usually take it back unless it's a formal contract. So legally, the author isn't wrong. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author felt they were being guilt-tripped and retracted the donation. The reaction might be harsh, but the author has the right to change their mind. The key here is the context of the pressure and the deceitful nature of the UNICEF kids' approach.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the teens were \"trapping people into feeling guilty.\" If the UNICEF kids were using manipulative tactics, then the author's reaction is a response to that manipulation. This could justify the decision to take back the money, even if the method was abrupt.\n\nIn summary, while the author's method might be seen as rude, the decision to retract the donation isn't necessarily the author's fault if they felt they were being deceived. The ethical issue lies more with the UNICEF kids' approach than the author's response. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
