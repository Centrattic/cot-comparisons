My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The story is about someone who donated a dollar but then took it back because they felt tricked.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person was at a Halloween event, gave out candy, and then two teenagers showed up asking for a donation for UNICEF. They gave the dollar but then felt uncomfortable when the teens were sarcastic. The person took the dollar back, got angry, and shut the door.\n\nSo, the main points here: Did they have the right to take back the donation? Donations are usually voluntary and given with the intention to support a cause. Once given, even if the recipient acts disrespectfully, does the donor have the right to take it back?\n\nBut wait, the person gave the dollar, then took it back. The question is whether that action was wrong. Legally, once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction. But morally, is there an issue here?\n\nThe person felt manipulated and used guilt-tripping tactics. The UNICEF representatives might have been using a common fundraising method, but the way they presented it was sarcastic and possibly insincere. The donor felt pressured and then took back the money. \n\nIs the donor at fault? The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the donor might have felt disrespected, but taking back the money after giving it might be seen as ungrateful or rude. On the other hand, if the donation was given under pressure and in a way that wasn't genuine, maybe the donor isn't in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they realized they felt like an asshole later. This shows some self-awareness. The key here is whether the initial donation was made with genuine intent. If the donor felt coerced, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, taking back the money after the fact could be seen as inappropriate because once given, it's theirs. \n\nBut there's a nuance. If the donation was given under false pretenses or the recipient was being dishonest, that could justify retracting it. However, in this case, the UNICEF representatives were just using a common method, even if their tone was off. The author might feel the method was unethical, but taking back the money could still be seen as a breach of the donation's intent.\n\nAnother angle: the author took back the dollar because they felt it was being used in a way that wasn't respectful. But the act of taking back a donation after it's been given is a contentious action. It could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. However, the author's motivation might be a valid reason to not support a cause they feel is being exploited.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the donation was given voluntarily. If the author felt pressured, they might not be in the wrong. But taking back a donation after the fact is generally not done. However, the tone and context of the donation matter. If the method was manipulative, maybe the author is justified. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's a close call. The key points are the pressure felt and the insincerity of the donation method. So maybe answer B (No).\n"
