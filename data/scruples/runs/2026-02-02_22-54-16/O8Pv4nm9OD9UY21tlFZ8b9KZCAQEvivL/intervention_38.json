My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, the situation: During Halloween, the author stayed home to hand out candy. A group of teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping language. The author gave a dollar, felt uncomfortable, then took it back and shut the door.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the donation and the manner in which the donation was solicited. The author gave a dollar because they felt pressured, which they later realized was due to the teenagers' sarcastic and manipulative approach. The author then reclaimed the dollar, feeling that the donation wasn't genuine and that UNICEF was being used inappropriately in that context.\n\nI need to consider if taking back the donation is justified. If the donation was made under duress or with the understanding that it was for a specific purpose (like buying candy for local kids), but then the author realized it was for a different cause presented in a manipulative way, then retracting it might be acceptable. Also, the teenagers used a tone that made the author feel trapped, which could imply that the initial donation wasn't voluntary. \n\nHowever, once a donation is given, even if the method was questionable, taking it back might be seen as rude. But in this case, the author took it back immediately, which might mitigate that. The author's reasoning is that the donation was given under false pretenses (thinking it was for candy costs) and that the cause was being misrepresented (third world kids not celebrating Halloween). \n\nSo, considering the context, the author's actions seem like a reasonable response to feeling manipulated. They corrected their mistake on the spot. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
