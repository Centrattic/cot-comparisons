My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author taking back a donation they made to UNICEF through trick-or-treaters. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author stayed home to hand out Halloween candy while their family went out. Teenagers came trick-or-treating for UNICEF, asking for donations. The author gave a dollar but then felt manipulated because the teens were sarcastic and exaggerated the impact. The author took back the dollar, accused them of guilt-tripping, and shut the door.\n\nNow, to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's actions and the context. The author initially donated a dollar, which was their choice. However, upon realizing the donation might be used in a way they disagree with (like UNICEF's approach), they took back the money. \n\nDonations are typically considered gifts, so once given, the recipient can't take them back. But in this case, the donation was made on the spot. The author's motivation for taking it back was feeling tricked by the teens' manipulation. The question is whether the author was wrong to retract the donation.\n\nPossible legal angle: If the donation was made and handed over, the recipient could keep it, even if the donor later regrets it. However, the author might argue that the donation was under duress due to the manipulation. But in most cases, such small, one-time donations aren't legally binding, so the recipient could return the money, but the donor can't force it.\n\nEthically, the author might feel justified if they believe the UNICEF representatives were using guilt-tripping tactics. However, the author could have chosen not to donate in the first place if they were uncomfortable. Taking back the money after giving it might be seen as a breach of trust, even if the initial donation was under questionable circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction could be seen as standing up against manipulative tactics. The sarcastic response from the teens might have made the author feel coerced, leading to a justified retraction of the donation.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's actions are seen as a right to retract a donation under duress or a breach of trust. In many cases, once a donation is given, it's considered a gift and can't be taken back, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by taking back the money. However, if the donation was made under pressure or deception, the author might have a valid reason. But legally and ethically, retracting a donation after giving it might not be justified unless there was a clear agreement to do so.\n\nThe answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because donations are typically final, and retracting them after the fact, especially in a confrontational manner, is not acceptable. However, there's a counterargument that the author felt manipulated, which complicates things. But overall, the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
