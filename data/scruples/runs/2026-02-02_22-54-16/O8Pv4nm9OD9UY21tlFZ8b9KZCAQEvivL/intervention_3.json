My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author gave out candy on Halloween while their family was out. Some teenagers came trick or treating, but they asked for a donation for UNICEF. The author had only a dollar in their wallet, gave it, but then the teens responded sarcastically, making a comment about feeding a village. Offended, the author snatched back the dollar and shut the door. Now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: The donation was made in a specific context\u2014Halloween, when people usually give candy. The UNICEF collectors used guilt-tripping, which made the author uncomfortable. The author then took back the money, feeling it was a scam. The question is about whether this action was wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, I don't think the author is in the wrong. Once you give something as a donation, it's generally considered a completed transaction. However, there might be some nuances here. But the user is probably more concerned with moral or ethical judgment rather than legal.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author felt manipulated and decided to take back the money. The UNICEF collectors might have been using a tactic to solicit donations, which could be seen as misleading. The author's reaction was impulsive, but they felt justified because the context was different\u2014Halloween is for candy, not donations. The sarcastic comment from the teens might have pushed the author's buttons.\n\nAnother angle: UNICEF often uses door-to-door collections, especially during Halloween. Some people might see this as a legitimate charity effort, while others argue that it's exploiting the holiday for fundraising. The author's decision to retract the donation could be seen as a response to perceived manipulation, making their action morally acceptable in their eyes.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once the money was given, taking it back was inconsiderate. But the author was in a vulnerable situation, possibly pressured into a donation. The key here is whether the author had the right to take it back after giving it. Since the donation wasn't a contract, the author wasn't obligated to give, and could take it back if they felt misled. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted based on feeling manipulated, and the context of Halloween being about candy, not donations. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
