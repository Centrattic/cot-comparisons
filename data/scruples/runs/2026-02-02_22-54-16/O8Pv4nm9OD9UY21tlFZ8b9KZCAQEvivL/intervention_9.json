My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they were giving out Halloween candy and a group of teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back after the kids made a sarcastic comment. The author is wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a position where they were expecting to give out candy to kids, which they do as a friendly gesture. The teenagers, however, were using the opportunity to solicit donations. The author felt that the approach was manipulative, especially the sarcastic remark about feeding a village with a dollar. That probably made the author feel uncomfortable and maybe even tricked, hence the reaction of taking back the dollar.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. When someone makes a donation, it's typically a voluntary act. If the author initially gave the dollar but then took it back because they felt coerced or lied to (if the UNICEF representatives were misleading about how the dollar would be used), maybe there's a case for the author being justified. The sarcastic comment might have felt like an insult, leading to an emotional response.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once the donation was given, taking it back could be seen as impolite or breaking a social contract. But the key here is the context of the donation. If the author was tricked into giving under false pretenses (like the sarcastic remark implying the dollar wouldn't actually help), then perhaps the author had a right to retract the donation. Also, the author points out that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, which might indicate they felt the approach was inconsiderate or using a sensitive issue for their own gain during a time when people are giving for a different reason.\n\nAnother angle is that the teenagers were acting on behalf of UNICEF. If the organization's representatives were being unprofessional or making false claims, then the author's reaction might be understandable. However, if the organization's approach is standard and the author overreacted, that could be a different take. But the story suggests the author felt trapped and was clearly annoyed by the manipulation.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the author's primary issue was feeling pressured and then realizing the donation might not be used as claimed. Taking back the money in that situation could be seen as a reasonable response to being misled, even if it's unconventional. People have the right to retract a donation if they feel it was given under false pretenses.\n\nSo considering all this, the author's actions seem justified. They were in a situation where they felt manipulated, and the sarcastic comment likely added to that feeling. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
