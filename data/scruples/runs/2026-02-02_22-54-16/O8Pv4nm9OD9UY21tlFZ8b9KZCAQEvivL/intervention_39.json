My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person stayed home to give out Halloween candy. When a group of older trick-or-treaters showed up, they asked for a donation for UNICEF. The writer gave a dollar but was upset when the teens mocked the donation, saying it could \"feed a village\" sarcastically. The writer then took back the dollar and shut the door. Now they're wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the writer justified in taking back the donation after the sarcastic comment? Did the UNICEF teens have a right to ask for donations in that context? And is the writer in the wrong for reacting that way?\n\nHmm. The writer gave the dollar initially, which was a voluntary donation. Then, when the teens responded sarcastically, the writer felt tricked into donating. They took back the money, which could be seen as reclaiming a gift. But is that allowed? If someone donates something, can they take it back if they feel pressured later? That's a tricky point.\n\nAlso, the UNICEF collectors might have been using guilt-tripping tactics, which is a common criticism. The writer felt trapped and then reacted emotionally. The question is whether the collectors' approach was appropriate. If they were using manipulative language to get donations, maybe the writer's reaction is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer did give the dollar first. After the interaction, they took it back, which might be seen as rude or breaking a social contract. But if the collectors were being sarcastic and disrespectful, maybe the writer had a right to feel that the situation wasn't genuine.\n\nAnother angle: the writer didn't have much money and gave what they had. The collectors' sarcastic remark might have been a way to mock people's generosity, which is unfair. The writer's response was to take back the money and leave, which could be seen as self-defense against manipulation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about intent. The writer didn't mean to donate; they felt pressured. The collectors might have been using a strategy that's common in fundraising, but if it's done in a disrespectful way, the writer's reaction is justifiable. Also, the writer's comment about third-world kids not celebrating Halloween might be a valid point, but that's more about the collectors' approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer might not be in the wrong because they felt manipulated and had a strong emotional reaction. They reclaimed their money after being treated disrespectfully. The answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
