My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about taking back a UNICEF donation after the trick-or-treaters were sarcastic.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly. The author stayed home to hand out Halloween candy. When some teenagers came asking for a UNICEF donation, they gave a dollar but were snatched and mocked. Then the author took the dollar back and shut the door, feeling conflicted afterward.\n\nThe key points here are: the author didn't want to donate, felt pressured by guilt-tripping, and reacted strongly by taking back the money. The main question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nLegally, once you give money as a donation, you can't typically take it back. But morally, it's more nuanced. The author felt manipulated and decided to reclaim the money. The teenagers' sarcastic comment might have been a tactic to pressure donors. The author's reaction could be seen as standing up against manipulation, but maybe also as being rude or inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone is donating under duress and then changes their mind, it's a gray area. The author might argue that the donation wasn't genuine because it was forced by guilt-tripping. However, others might say that once a donation is made, retracting it isn't appropriate, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the context of UNICEF's work is for children in need. The author's argument is that the method of fundraising is exploitative. But perhaps the teenagers were just acting as part of their job. The author's right to withdraw the money could depend on local laws, but generally, once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were justified. If the donation was given under false pretenses or manipulation, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the act of taking back money after giving it could be seen as unethical or rude. But given the context, maybe it's understandable. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to decide between A and B.\n"
