My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation is that during Halloween, the author gave out candy but was approached by older trick-or-treaters asking for donations for UNICEF. The author gave a dollar, but then the teens acted sarcastically, leading the author to snatch the dollar back and shut the door.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author felt pressured by the UNICEF collectors, who used guilt-tripping. The sarcastic behavior of the teens made the author uncomfortable. The author then took back the money, which raises the question of whether that was wrong.\n\nSo, considering the circumstances: the author was in a vulnerable situation, being approached unexpectedly. The collectors might have been overstepping, using manipulative tactics. The author's reaction, while perhaps abrupt, could be a justified response to feeling coerced. However, taking back the donation after giving it might be seen as dishonest if the initial donation was made with the intention of contributing to UNICEF's cause.\n\nBut the author mentions that the donation was made under duress, feeling trapped. If the donation wasn't given freely, then the author isn't obligated to keep it. However, once the money was given, taking it back could be seen as breaking a social contract, even if the initial conditions were uncomfortable.\n\nUNICEF's role here is important. If the collectors were acting on their behalf, then the author's action might be problematic. But if the collectors were using inappropriate tactics, the author's response is understandable. The author's argument is that the approach was manipulative, targeting people in a situation where they might feel forced to donate.\n\nAnother angle is the right to retract a donation. If someone donates under false pretenses or coercion, they might have the right to take it back. However, this is more about the moral obligation rather than legal. Socially, people might expect that once a donation is given, even if done under pressure, it's not appropriate to take it back.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they felt manipulated. The sarcastic comment from the teens likely exacerbated the situation. The author's reaction, while harsh, stems from a desire to not support what they perceived as exploitative tactics.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted on their discomfort and the feeling of being coerced. However, the act of taking back the money might be seen as rude or dishonest by some. But considering the context, the author's actions are more about reclaiming agency in an uncomfortable situation.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author was responding to a situation where they felt manipulated, and retracting the donation in that context is understandable.\n"
