My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation is during Halloween when they were handing out candy. Some older teens showed up asking for donations for UNICEF with a bit of sarcastic flair. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar, then took it back when they felt the approach was manipulative.\n\nFirst, the context is important. Halloween is a time for kids to collect candy, and the author is in a position where they're giving out candy. The trick-or-treaters here are older, teenagers, not typical kids. They mention \"trick or treat for UNICEF,\" which is a common way to collect donations, but the author felt it was being used to guilt-trip people. The author gave the only dollar they had, but then took it back because they felt manipulated.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the nature of the solicitation. The author felt they were being pressured into donating, and when the teens acted sarcastically, it made the author feel that the donation wasn't genuine. The author then decided to retract the donation. \n\nIn terms of rights, once a donation is given, can it be taken back? Legally, a donation is a gift and once given, the recipient can keep it. However, the author took it back before the transaction was complete. They snatched the dollar back immediately. The question is whether this action is considered wrong.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that the solicitation was manipulative and that they wanted to support local kids by giving candy but didn't want to support a cause they felt was misusing the opportunity. They felt the UNICEF representatives were exploiting the Halloween tradition for their own fundraising, which they found unethical.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author acted on their discomfort with the pressure and perceived sarcasm. They may have felt that their initial donation wasn't a genuine choice. However, in social interactions, once you give something, even if you later regret it, taking it back can be seen as impolite. But if the donor feels coerced, they might have a justification for retracting their donation quickly.\n\nThe author's actions were impulsive, but they were in the moment. Considering the situation, the author isn't in the wrong because they were reacting to feeling pressured and manipulated. They took back the donation before it was finalized, and their intent was to not support the method of fundraising they found unethical. Their explanation shows they considered the local versus global context and felt the approach was inappropriate.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were acting on their belief that the donation was being forced in a manipulative way, and they retracted it immediately, which in the heat of the moment is understandable.\n"
