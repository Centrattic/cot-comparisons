My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The scenario is that during Halloween, they gave out candy while their family was out. Some older trick-or-treaters came, asked for a donation for UNICEF, and the author felt they were being guilt-tripped. The teens acted sarcastically, which made the author snatch back the dollar and shut the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they were handling candy for kids, and these older individuals approached with a donation request. The key points here are the intent behind the donation and the reaction to the perceived sarcasm. \n\nThe author gave a dollar initially but then took it back. The teens' behavior was mocking, which is a problem. If someone is being asked to donate and then feels manipulated or tricked, especially with sarcastic remarks, it's reasonable for the person to retract their donation. The author's frustration might be justified if they felt the donation was coerced or not genuine. \n\nHowever, there's a question about the appropriateness of taking back the money after it's already been given. But in many cases, if someone realizes they were pressured into a donation, they can retract it. The sarcastic comment might have crossed a line, making the situation uncomfortable. The author's response, while abrupt, could be seen as a reaction to being harassed rather than a refusal without cause. \n\nAnother angle is the purpose of the donation. If the teens were genuinely collecting for UNICEF, but their method was inappropriate, the author's action might still be understandable. The author might not be in the wrong because the issue was the manner in which the donation was solicited, not the act of taking back the money. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. If the author had already given the money, but then took it back aggressively, that could be seen as rude. However, the context of feeling trapped and the sarcastic remarks from the teens justifies the author's reaction. The key is whether the author had the right to retract the donation once given. Typically, donations can be taken back if the donor feels they were coerced. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They responded to a situation where they felt manipulated and the solicitation was done in a mocking way. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
