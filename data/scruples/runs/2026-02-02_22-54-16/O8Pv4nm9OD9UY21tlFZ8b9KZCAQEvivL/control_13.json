My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person offered to stay home and give out Halloween candy while their family went out. They usually have a bowl of candy, but then some teenage trick-or-treaters came asking for donations for UNICEF. The person had only a dollar, gave it, but then took it back because they felt the teens were being sarcastic and manipulative. They shut the door, feeling guilty afterward.\n\nSo, the key points here. The person gave the dollar initially but took it back. The question is about whether that action was wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, once you give money, it's theirs. Taking it back could be seen as rude or dishonest. But the context matters. The teens used guilt-tripping, said they could feed a village, which was sarcastic. The person felt trapped and didn't like being manipulated. They corrected the teens' statement about third-world kids celebrating Halloween, which might be a valid point. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were taking advantage of a situation (Halloween) to guilt-trip people for a different cause. The person felt they were being manipulated and wanted to correct the misrepresentation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, giving money is a choice, but once given, taking it back is problematic. However, the situation involved coercion and misinformation. The teens' sarcastic comment might have been a trick, leading the author to realize they were being manipulated. In that case, taking back the money could be justified as self-correction after realizing the mistake. \n\nBut legally or socially, once the money is given, it's theirs. However, if the donation was made under false pretenses (like the UNICEF representative being a scam), the person might have a case. The author might have felt deceived, which complicates the morality. \n\nThe author's action was impulsive. They took back the money and shut the door. But considering the manipulation involved, maybe it's understandable. The key is whether the author was wrong in taking back the donation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often don't like being guilt-tripped. The author's reaction, while perhaps rude, stems from feeling manipulated. The author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to a situation where they felt taken advantage of. \n\nSo, considering the manipulation and the realization that they were being tricked, the author's action could be seen as a reasonable response, not wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
