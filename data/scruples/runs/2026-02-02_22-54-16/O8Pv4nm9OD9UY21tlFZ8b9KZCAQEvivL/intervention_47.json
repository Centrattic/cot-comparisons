My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by taking back their UNICEF donation. The scenario involves a Halloween situation where the author stayed home to give out candy. Then, some teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar but then took it back when they realized the donation was being mocked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. There's no mention of any legal issue here. The author isn't breaking any laws by taking back their money. The problem might be more about social norms and ethics.\n\nEthically, the author felt pressured into donating. The teenagers used a guilt-trip, which can be coercive. The author then took back the dollar when they realized the donation was being mocked. This could be seen as a self-defense against manipulation. However, once a donation is given, even if under pressure, taking it back might be seen as rude or inappropriate. But the author's reasoning is that the donation was based on a false premise (mocking the amount) and that the UNICEF representatives were exploiting the situation.\n\nThe author's actions were impulsive but based on a feeling of being tricked. The key point is whether the donation was made under duress. If someone feels coerced into a donation, they might have the right to retract it. But in this case, the author physically took back the money, which could be seen as aggressive or confrontational.\n\nHowever, the context is important. The teenagers were acting in a way that could be seen as disrespectful, mocking the donation. The author's reaction was a response to that disrespect. The author might argue that they were protecting their own feelings and not being taken advantage of. \n\nSocially, there's a difference between donating out of genuine willingness and being guilt-tripped. The author's main issue was the manipulation tactics used by the UNICEF representatives. By taking the money back, the author is asserting their autonomy. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author feels they were not genuinely willing to donate, they aren't in the wrong for retracting. However, the method of taking back the money\u2014snatching it and shutting the door\u2014might be considered aggressive, but the underlying action of retracting a coerced donation is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They felt pressured, realized the donation wasn't genuine, and took back the money when confronted with mockery. The main issue is the ethical use of guilt-tripping, which the author objected to. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
