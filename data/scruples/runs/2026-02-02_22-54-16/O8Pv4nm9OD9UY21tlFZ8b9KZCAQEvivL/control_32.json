My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves Halloween trick-or-treating where the author offered to give out candy while their family left. Then, some older trick-or-treaters came asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then was upset when the teen reacted sarcastically. The author took back the dollar and shut the door.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author gave a donation but felt manipulated, and then reclaimed it. The question is whether that action was wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of donating and retracting a donation. Donations are typically voluntary, and if someone feels coerced, maybe they have a right to reconsider. But once given, is it possible to take it back? The author took the dollar from the teen after the sarcastic comment. That's a bit of a gray area. If the donation was already given, taking it back might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the teen had already accepted it. However, the author's action was based on feeling that the donation was made under pressure and misinformation. The story mentions the author realized that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, so maybe the UNICEF request was exploiting that misconception. \n\nAnother angle: the author gave a dollar but then assessed the situation and took back the money. Is that permissible? If the author felt they were misled, perhaps they were justified in retrieving the money. However, the act of taking it back might be abrupt and could be seen as unkind. But considering the context of a public charity like UNICEF, which is reputable, maybe the teens misused their association. The author's response was direct but maybe not entirely wrong. \n\nAlso, the author's initial donation was out of a situation where they felt cornered. It's important to note that donations should be voluntary, and if the request was manipulative, the author might have been justified in rethinking. The fact that the author gave the money first but then reclaimed it shows a change of heart, which can happen, but the method might be questionable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the donation was made with the intention to give, and if retracting it after the fact is acceptable. If the author felt they were pressured into a donation and realized it wasn't appropriate, maybe not in the wrong. But if the donation was already given, taking it back could be seen as impolite. However, the story mentions that the teens were using guilt-tripping and maybe even exaggerating the use of the donation. In that case, the author's action might be a valid response to what they perceived as manipulation. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards B: No, the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to withdraw their donation if they felt it was given under false pretenses or undue pressure. The sarcastic comment from the teen might have triggered the realization that the approach was inappropriate. While it's a bit of a strong reaction, the author's action was based on correcting a perceived mistake, which is understandable.\n"
