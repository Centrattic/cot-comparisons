My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nSo, the person was handing out candy on Halloween. They had a one-dollar bill in their wallet and donated it to a group of teenagers asking for UNICEF. The teens reacted sarcastically, saying the dollar could feed a village and mocked the amount. The person then took back the dollar and shut the door, feeling conflicted afterward. The question is whether they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once money is given as a donation, it's a completed transaction. But in this case, the donation was taken back immediately after being given. So technically, the person can reclaim the money since it wasn't actually donated yet. The moment they took it back, the donation was revoked. So legally, they're probably in the right.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The person felt pressured and mocked, which led them to take back the money. The UNICEF teens used guilt-tripping tactics, which is a manipulative approach. The author might feel that the donation was coerced, so taking it back as a reaction to the sarcasm is understandable. However, some might argue that once a donation is made, retracting it could be seen as dishonest, especially if there's no immediate reason like fraud.\n\nAnother angle is the context of Halloween. It's a time when people are expecting to give out candy, and the UNICEF teens are leveraging that to collect donations. The author's frustration stems from feeling that UNICEF is exploiting a cultural event (Halloween) to guilt-trip people into donating. This could be seen as valid criticism of how UNICEF is using the situation, rather than the donation itself being wrong.\n\nThe sarcastic response from the teens likely played a role in the author's decision. The author felt embarrassed or pressured into giving a small amount and then was mocked for it. Taking back the dollar was a reaction to that mockery, which might be justified as a defense of their own feelings rather than a malicious act.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author didn't have the right to take back the money once given. Donations are typically considered voluntary and final. The fact that the author had only a dollar in their wallet adds context\u2014the donation was minimal, and the author might have felt it was not a generous amount to begin with.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions could be seen as a justified response to being manipulated. They felt trapped and reacted impulsively, but the situation was emotionally charged. The key here is whether the donation was made under duress. If the UNICEF teens were using aggressive tactics, the author's decision to retract the donation could be viewed as a reasonable reaction.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are more about reclaiming a donation that was given under what they perceived as coercive and sarcastic circumstances. Legally and ethically, there's a case to be made that the author is not in the wrong because the donation was immediate and retracted before any actual contribution was made. The context of the situation, including the teenagers' behavior, supports the author's justification for taking back the money.\n"
