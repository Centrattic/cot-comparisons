My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about taking back a UNICEF donation after a negative experience with teenagers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author was giving out candy on Halloween, and some older trick-or-treaters came asking for a donation for UNICEF. They used guilt-tripping language, the author gave a dollar but then took it back because of the sarcasm and the way they presented the request. The author felt it was taking advantage, so he snatched the dollar and told them off.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author had the right to refuse to donate if they felt pressured. It's their money, and they can choose where to give. The way the teenagers acted\u2014sarcasm and maybe over-the-top statements\u2014might have made the author feel manipulated. Taking back the dollar could be seen as standing up for oneself.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author initially gave the dollar, then took it back. Is that acceptable? The act of taking back money after a donation could be seen as rude or impolite. However, the story mentions that the author felt trapped and the manner of the request was sarcastic. Maybe the initial donation wasn't made willingly, so retracting it isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nAlso, the teenagers might have been doing it as part of a school project or a way to collect donations. If they were acting in the name of UNICEF, perhaps they should have been more respectful. But the author's reaction was a bit aggressive, slamming the door. That could be seen as harsh, but the author's justification is that they felt pressured and the situation wasn't genuine.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about intentions and actions. The author had the right to decide where to give money, and if they felt coerced, they can retract. The teenagers might have overstepped with their approach. So the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
