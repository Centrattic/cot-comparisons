My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Halloween trick-or-treating where the author stayed home to hand out candy. Then some teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, making a sarcastic comment about a dollar feeding a village. The author took back the dollar, was harsh, and shut the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author gave a dollar initially but felt manipulated. The UNICEF collectors used guilt-tripping, which the author found offensive. On the other hand, UNICEF is a reputable charity, and their collectors might be doing their job to raise funds. The author's reaction was aggressive\u2014snatching the dollar back and yelling at them. \n\nIs it wrong to retract a donation? Normally, once you give money, you can't take it back, but maybe in this case, the author felt pressured. However, reacting with anger and slamming the door might be inappropriate. The collector's sarcasm might have escalated things, but the author's response was confrontational. \n\nThe key points are the pressure tactic from the collectors and the author's reaction. While the collectors' approach might be questionable, the author's method of taking back the donation was confrontational. They could have calmly refused instead of being aggressive. So maybe the author is in the wrong because of the hostile response, even if they felt pressured. Alternatively, if the collectors were using guilt-tripping, the author has a right to be upset. But the way they handled it might be the issue. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of their aggressive reaction, regardless of feeling pressured. However, others might argue that they had the right to retract the donation. But generally, once given, a donation is final, so taking it back is not acceptable. Hence, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
