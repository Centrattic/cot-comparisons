My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person offered to stay home and give out Halloween candy while their family went trick-or-treating. When some teenagers came, they asked for a donation for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping about poor kids not having Halloween. The person gave a dollar but then snatched it back because they found the approach manipulative and sarcastic. They shut the door, later feeling conflicted.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author gave the money initially but took it back. Was it wrong to take it back? Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one side, once you give a donation, even if it's given under pressure, you can't just take it back. That might be seen as unethical because it's about trust and integrity. The person might have agreed to give the donation, and retracting it could be considered a breach of that agreement. Also, the teenagers were acting on behalf of UNICEF, so treating them rudely by snatching the money and shutting the door could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt manipulated and didn't want to support an organization they felt was using guilt tactics. The sarcastic comment from the teens might have made the author feel they were being taken advantage of. The author might believe that the donation wasn't meant to be given, so taking it back was a way to not support what they thought was manipulation.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author took back the money after giving it. That's not just refusing to donate; it's taking back a gift that has already been given. Legally and ethically, once you give a donation, you can't reclaim it. The author's action might be seen as unethical because it's not just about the initial decision but also about taking back something that was already given.\n\nAlso, the manner in which they took the money back\u2014snatching it and being rude\u2014shows a lack of respect. Even if the author felt manipulated, a better approach might have been to refuse politely instead of being confrontational. The teenagers were volunteers, so the author's reaction could be seen as aggressive.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author had the right to change their mind, especially if they felt the donation was made under false pretenses. If the UNICEF collectors were being dishonest or manipulative, the author might believe they shouldn't support that. But the question here is about the action of taking back the donation, not just not giving it in the first place.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is in a tough spot. They might feel they were guilt-tripped, but once the donation is made, retracting it isn't straightforward. The author's justification is that the donation wasn't meant to be given, but that doesn't necessarily make retracting it right. It's more about how they handled the situation rather than the initial decision.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions could be seen as crossing a line by taking back the donation and being rude. They're not in the wrong in terms of their feelings of being manipulated, but the act of taking back the money after giving it is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
