My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about taking back a UNICEF donation. Let me break it down.\n\nThe person stayed home to give out Halloween candy while their family went trick-or-treating. They had a bowl of candy for kids to take. Then some teenagers came, asked for donations for UNICEF, and made a sarcastic comment about the dollar being enough to feed a village. The author took back the dollar, got angry, and shut the door. Now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, the author gave a dollar, which was all they had. The teens' response was sarcastic, which might have been offensive. The author felt trapped and then took their money back. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, once money is given, it's theirs to keep. But if the donation was made under duress or with a sense of being manipulated, maybe it's different. The UNICEF kids used guilt-tripping, which the author didn't like. The author's reaction was to take back the dollar and confront the teens. \n\nGuilt-tripping is manipulative, and the author felt uncomfortable. Taking back the money might be seen as reclaiming a donation that was given under pressure. But legally, once given, it's a donation and can't be taken back. However, morally, if the donation was coerced, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for retracting it.\n\nAlso, the author pointed out that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, so the use of the context was misleading. That could imply the UNICEF kids were exploiting the situation. The author's frustration might be justified.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author felt manipulated and corrected the situation. The sarcastic remark was offensive, and the author had the right to take back their money if they felt it was given under false pretenses. Although normally you can't take back donations, in this case, the circumstances of pressure and sarcasm might justify the action.\n"
