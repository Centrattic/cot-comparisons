My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves Halloween candy distribution and a UNICEF donation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's family was going to trick-or-treat, and they offered to stay home to hand out candy. Their neighborhood is upper middle class, so people from other areas come there for better candy. They usually have a bowl for kids to grab from. The author is there when two teenagers come, asking for a UNICEF donation, saying it's for poor kids who can't trick-or-treat because they live in poor countries. The author gives a dollar but feels uncomfortable, especially when the teens act sarcastic. Then the author takes back the dollar, says they could give the cost of candy instead, criticizes UNICEF's approach, and slams the door.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's actions and intentions. Let me consider the context. The author was in a situation where they were approached unexpectedly. The teens used guilt-tripping tactics, according to the author. The author felt trapped and then reacted by taking back the dollar, which was given under what they perceived as manipulative circumstances. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the donation was voluntary. If the author felt coerced or lied about the purpose (like the UNICEF part), then maybe they're justified. But wait, UNICEF does collect donations for children in need, so maybe the teens were being sarcastic, but the cause itself is legitimate. The author's reaction of taking the money back might be seen as rude or impulsive. However, the author might have felt they were being tricked into giving more than they intended. \n\nAnother angle: giving to UNICEF is a donation. If the author changed their mind after giving it, can they retract it? In terms of ethics, once a donation is given, it's generally considered a final act unless there's fraud or misrepresentation. By taking it back, the author is reversing the transaction, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the donation was obtained through misleading information or pressure, maybe the author has a point. \n\nThe teens' sarcasm about feeding a village might have been a joke, but the author found it offensive. However, the author's response was to snatch the money and criticize them. That could be seen as confrontational and possibly inconsiderate. The author might have handled it differently, like politely declining or explaining their stance without being confrontational. \n\nBut the author's main argument is that they felt guilt-tripped into giving more than they wanted. They compared it to the cost of candy given to local kids. So they're making a point about consistency in charity. The question is, is taking back the donation justified? \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. If the author didn't want to donate, they could have just refused without giving. But once they gave, retracting it might not be appropriate unless there was a misunderstanding. However, the initial donation was under pressure, which complicates things. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as a reaction to feeling manipulated. They took back the money to avoid supporting what they saw as a guilt-based fundraising tactic. Some might argue that the author had the right to change their mind, especially if they felt deceived. Others might say that once a donation is given, it's best to let it go, and taking it back is rude. \n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong because they were responding to a situation they found uncomfortable and felt coerced. However, their method of handling it was perhaps not the best approach. So, considering all angles, the answer might be B (No), they are not in the wrong, but there are arguments on both sides.\n"
