My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person stayed home to hand out Halloween candy while their family was out. Then, teenagers came trick-or-treating for UNICEF, asking for donations. The writer felt pressured, gave a dollar, but after the teens sarcastically commented about feeding a village, the writer took back the dollar and shut the door. Now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: The writer gave a dollar initially but took it back after feeling harassed. The question is about their right to do that.\n\nLegally, once you give money to someone, it's theirs. But in this case, the writer took it back immediately after giving it. So maybe there's an issue with revoking a donation. However, if the donation wasn't formal and was given under duress (the guilt-tripping), then maybe the writer has a point. But taking back the money by force isn't the best approach.\n\nEthically, the writer might feel they were manipulated and wanted to correct the donation. But UNICEF collecting donations through kids is a common practice. However, the teens' sarcastic remarks might have crossed a line. The writer's reaction was confrontational, which could be seen as rude, but maybe justified if they felt pressured.\n\nAlso, the writer's argument is that the donation was for UNICEF, which the writer believes isn't directly related to Halloween. But UNICEF does work with children in need, and the collection is a way to raise funds. The writer might not have agreed with the method, but taking back the donation could be seen as not supporting a good cause, but the way they did it was confrontational.\n\nSo, considering all angles: The writer wasn't in the wrong for not wanting to donate, especially if they felt the method was manipulative. But taking back the money after giving it might be an issue. However, the context of immediate revocation after feeling tricked could be seen as a mistake in handling the situation, but not necessarily being in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics here. Since the writer was defensive and maybe didn't handle it calmly, but the initial donation was under questionable circumstances, it's a bit of a gray area. But I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the person had the right to withdraw their donation if they felt pressured, even if the method was abrupt. The main issue is the pressure tactics, not the act of taking back the money.\n"
