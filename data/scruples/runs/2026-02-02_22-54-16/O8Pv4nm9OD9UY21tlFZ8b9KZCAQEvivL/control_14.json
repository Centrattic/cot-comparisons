My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Halloween trick-or-treating where the person stayed home to give out candy. Then some older kids came asking for a UNICEF donation. The author gave them a dollar but then took it back when the kids acted sarcastic. The author is asking if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Halloween is a time where it's common for kids to go door-to-door, and sometimes organizations like UNICEF collect donations. The author mentions that the trick-or-treaters are teenagers, which might be a bit old, but they still came in costume. The author gave a dollar but then felt manipulated because of the sarcastic comment. They took back the money and shut the door.\n\nIs the author wrong for taking back the money? Well, when you donate, you're giving voluntarily. If the person felt pressured or the donation was taken in a way they didn't intend, they might have the right to retract it. The key here is that the donation might have been made under a sense of obligation or guilt-tripping. The author changed their mind after realizing the context was different from their intention.\n\nOn the other hand, UNICEF volunteers are usually doing legitimate work, even if a few might be using the event for something else. The author's response was harsh\u2014snatching the money and shutting the door. That could be seen as rude, especially if the teens were just doing their thing. But if the author felt tricked, maybe they had a right to correct that.\n\nAlso, the author gave the dollar initially, but then realized it wasn't for candy or the usual donation. The sarcastic comment might have been a way to make the author feel bad, which is a form of guilt-tripping. The author's reaction was to take back the money and set boundaries, which could be justified if they felt coerced.\n\nHowever, taking back a donation after it's been given might not be the best approach. Maybe they should have refused to give in the first place instead of snatching it back. But in the heat of the moment, the author acted on impulse. The question is whether that action was wrong. Since the donation was made under pressure, the author might not be at fault for retracting it. The problem is the method they used\u2014maybe they should have handled it more politely, but the core issue is about feeling manipulated.\n\nAnother angle: The author's comment about third-world countries not celebrating Halloween might be a bit off. But the main issue is the donation retraction. If the author believed the donation wasn't being used as intended, they had the right to take it back. So, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B (No).\n"
