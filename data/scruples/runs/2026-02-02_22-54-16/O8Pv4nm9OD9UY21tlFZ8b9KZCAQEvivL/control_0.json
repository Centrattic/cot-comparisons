My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about donating to UNICEF during Halloween. The author gave out candy to trick-or-treaters, but a group of teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF. They used a guilt-tripping message about poor kids in other countries. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back because of the sarcastic comment from the teens. The author then slammed the door on them. Now, the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author initially offered to give out candy, which they normally do. The UNICEF collectors came in, asked for a donation with a specific message that made the author feel trapped. The author gave a dollar but took it back because the teens were being sarcastic. The author's reaction was to snatch the money and yell at them, then shut the door.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have the right to take back the donation? Was the UNICEF collectors' approach appropriate? Is the author justified in their actions?\n\nWhen you make a donation, especially in person, it's generally considered a completed transaction once the money is given. However, if the donation was made under duress or the donor realized they made a mistake, there might be different perspectives. The author felt tricked or guilted into giving, so they might feel it's their right to retract the donation. However, once the money is handed over, taking it back could be seen as impolite, especially if the recipient has already acknowledged it.\n\nThe UNICEF collectors' approach might be questionable if they were using manipulative tactics. However, UNICEF itself is a reputable organization, so their volunteers might be following a script or method. The teenagers' sarcastic comment could be part of how they were approaching donations, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's reaction.\n\nThe author's reaction was harsh\u2014snatching the money, yelling, and slamming the door. Even if they felt wronged, that's a confrontational and disrespectful response. The author might feel justified, but the way they handled it could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the teenagers were just doing their job, even if imperfectly.\n\nAnother angle: The author didn't have to donate in the first place. They could have said no. But once they gave the dollar, retracting it might be a breach of etiquette. However, if the donation was made under false pretenses (like manipulation), the author might not be at fault for correcting that.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were rude, but the initial decision to take back the donation might be understandable given the situation. The main issue is the manner in which they took back the money and the aggressive response. So, the author is not in the wrong for retracting the donation if they felt it was under coercion, but their method was poor. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If we focus on the action of taking back the donation, maybe they aren't. But if the focus is on the rude behavior, then they are. The answer likely hinges on whether retracting a donation is allowed, and the appropriateness of the response.\n\nIn many cases, once a donation is given, it's considered a gift and can't be taken back. But if there was a misunderstanding or coercion, some might argue the donor can retract. The author's justification is that the UNICEF collectors were using guilt-tripping and being sarcastic. However, the author's reaction was excessive. So, the author might not be at fault for wanting to retract the donation but is at fault for how they handled it. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author had the right to retract the donation if they felt it was given under duress, but their method was poor. But maybe the community would side with the author because the UNICEF collectors were unprofessional. Alternatively, others might think the author was rude regardless. It's a tough call. I think the key is whether the author is in the wrong for taking back the donation. If the donation was made under pressure, then the author isn't wrong. The act of taking back the money, while impolite, might not be morally wrong if the initial act was coerced. However, the way they did it was definitely inconsiderate. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is a moral judgment. So, the author isn't in the wrong for retracting the donation, but their behavior was inappropriate. Since the question is about the author's actions in general, maybe the answer is B because the author's intent was to correct a mistake, even if the method was poor. Alternatively, the answer might be A because they were rude. I'm a bit torn. But in AITA scenarios, people often consider the rightness of the action regardless of the method. If the author felt coerced, retracting the donation is okay. So answer B.\n"
