My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The person stayed home to give out Halloween candy while their family was out. Then, some teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, using a guilt-tripping approach. The author felt pressured and gave a dollar but later took it back because they felt the approach was manipulative.\n\nSo, the key points here are the pressure applied by the teenagers and the author's reaction. The author mentions that the teens used a sarcastic tone and exaggerated the impact of the dollar, which probably made the author feel uncomfortable. The reaction was to snatch the dollar back and shut the door.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author gave the dollar initially but felt coerced. Taking it back might be seen as a way to reclaim their decision once they realized they didn't want to donate under those circumstances. On the other hand, the teens were representing UNICEF, which is a legitimate charity. However, the method they used\u2014guilt-tripping and sarcastic remarks\u2014could be problematic. It's possible that the teens misrepresented the charity's intentions or were using an inappropriate tactic to get donations.\n\nThe author's anger at the manipulation might justify their reaction. They felt tricked into a donation, so reclaiming the money could be seen as a justified response to the pressure. However, the act of snatching the dollar back and shutting the door might come off as rude or aggressive. But considering the context, maybe the author's frustration was valid.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the author is responsible for the teens' behavior. Since they were acting on behalf of UNICEF, the charity itself might have issues with their canvassing methods. But the author isn't directly responsible for the teens' tactics. They're reacting to how they were approached.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author have the right to take back the donation? If the donation wasn't given under duress, maybe not. But in this case, the author felt pressured and later regretted it. So, the act of retrieving the dollar could be seen as correcting a mistake made under pressure. However, if the donation was already given and accepted, taking it back might be problematic. But the situation involved immediate retrieval before the money was transferred or processed, so there's wiggle room.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the donation amount\u2014mentioning that the candy given out costs 30-50 cents, implying the dollar might be excessive\u2014adds another layer. The author's critique of the UNICEF approach (that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween) suggests they felt the cause wasn't being represented accurately.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author's actions were a reaction to perceived manipulation. The key here is whether the manipulation was justified. If the UNICEF representatives were using misleading tactics, the author's response could be seen as a stand against that. However, the method of response\u2014snatching the money and shutting the door\u2014might not be the most constructive way to address the issue, but the intent was to reclaim the donation when realizing the pressure tactics.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions, while perhaps aggressive, were in response to feeling coerced and manipulated. The fault might lie with the UNICEF representatives for using pressure tactics, not the author for taking back the donation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
