My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves the author giving $1 to UNICEF trick-or-treaters but then snatching it back because they felt the collectors were being sarcastic and guilt-tripping. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author gave a dollar, which was the only money they had. The teenagers acted sarcastically, which annoyed the author. The author took back the dollar, criticized their approach, and slammed the door. The main issue is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel wronged by the UNICEF collectors' tone. The sarcastic comment about feeding a village with a dollar could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful. The author then took back the money, maybe to save face or because they felt pressured. But was that justified?\n\nOn the other hand, the UNICEF collectors were doing their job, trying to collect donations. Even if their method was pushy or sarcastic, the author gave the money initially. Taking it back might be seen as impolite or inconsiderate. However, the author had the right to change their mind, especially if they felt coerced. The sarcastic comment might have made the author feel uncomfortable, which influenced their decision.\n\nThe ethical angle here is tricky. The author isn't obligated to give money, and the collectors can't force them. However, the way the collectors approached could be unprofessional. The author's reaction might be seen as valid because they felt manipulated. But snatching the dollar back might be seen as rude, even if their feelings were hurt.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and the actions. The author's intent was to stop being manipulated, but their action was abrupt. However, given that the collectors were using guilt-tripping and sarcasm, the author's response is more about self-respect. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the author had the right to retract the donation if they felt pressured. The collectors' approach was questionable, and the author's reaction, while maybe impulsive, was a response to that pressure.\n"
