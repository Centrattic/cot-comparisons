My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe person gave out candy on Halloween while their family was out. They encountered some teenagers asking for donations for UNICEF, which they did by using a guilt-tripping approach. The author felt uncomfortable and gave a dollar, but then the teens acted sarcastically, making a big show of the dollar. In response, the author took back the dollar and shut the door, feeling conflicted afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were wrong. The key points are the initial donation and then reclaiming it. The author donated a dollar, which is a personal choice. However, after the interaction, they took it back. Legally, once money is given as a donation, it's usually a completed transaction. Taking it back might be an issue here. \n\nBut there's the context of the collectors being teenagers. In some places, there are rules about who can collect donations. Sometimes, it's required to have proper authorization. If these teens were not authorized by UNICEF, the author might have the right to reclaim the money. Also, the sarcastic comments could imply that the collectors weren't acting appropriately, which the author found off-putting.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of donations. Donations are generally voluntary. If the author felt pressured or tricked into giving, they might have a valid reason to ask for it back. But in most cases, once a donation is made, it's considered a gift and can't be taken back. However, if the collection was illegal or misrepresented, that could be different.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014snatching the money back and being confrontational\u2014might be seen as aggressive, but their motivation was feeling manipulated. The question is whether the author's actions were justified given the situation. The answer hinges on whether the initial donation was made under duress or misinformation and if the author had the right to reclaim it. If the collectors were legitimate, the author could be wrong. If they were not, the author might be in the right.\n\nI should also consider cultural or legal norms. In some regions, door-to-door collections, especially by youth, might not be allowed unless they have proper permits. If that's the case, the author could argue the donation wasn't valid. Additionally, the sarcastic response from the teens might indicate they weren't genuine, which the author had a right to question.\n\nSo, putting it all together, if the collectors were unauthorized, the author's actions could be justified. If they were authorized, the author might have acted wrongly by taking back the donation. The answer depends on the legitimacy of the collectors. Since the scenario doesn't specify, I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because of the pressure tactics used and the questionable behavior of the collectors.\n"
