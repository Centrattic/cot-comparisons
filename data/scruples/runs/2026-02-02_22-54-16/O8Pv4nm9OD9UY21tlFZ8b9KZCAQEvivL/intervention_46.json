My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation involves Halloween trick-or-treating where the author gave out candy and was approached by teenagers collecting for UNICEF. The key points here are the context of the interaction and the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the author was in the middle of giving out candy, which they enjoy doing. Then, the teens approached, presented the UNICEF donation as a \"trick or treat\" option, using guilt-tripping about poor children in other countries. The author says they felt trapped, gave a dollar, but then took it back after the teens mocked the donation. The author's reaction was defensive, feeling like they were manipulated.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they might have felt uncomfortable with the pressure to donate, especially if the teens were being sarcastic. The author's response was impulsive, but the question is whether that makes them at fault. On the other hand, the teens might have been doing their job as UNICEF ambassadors, though their sarcastic comment could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nThe author took back the dollar, which is a personal choice. Donations are voluntary, and the author isn't obligated to give. However, the situation might have escalated due to the teens' approach. The author's reaction could be viewed as justified if they felt pressured. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for reclaiming their money if they felt misled or uncomfortable. The guilt-tripping might have been the real issue here. So, leaning towards answer B.\n"
