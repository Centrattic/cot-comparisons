My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking back their UNICEF donation. They gave $1 to some teenagers trick-or-treating for UNICEF, but the teens were sarcastic about it. The person then snatched the dollar back and shut the door. They feel guilty afterward but are unsure if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the person was in a position where they were asked for a donation, gave $1, and then felt the teens were mocking them. The reaction of taking back the money might be seen as impulsive. However, the person might have felt disrespected or tricked into donating. \n\nUNICEF's program, like many fundraising efforts, often uses emotional appeals. The teenagers were acting on behalf of the organization, but their sarcastic comments might have been unprofessional or inappropriate. The person's reaction could be seen as a response to feeling manipulated. \n\nLegally, once a donation is given, it belongs to the recipient. So taking it back physically might not be legally correct, but the person might not have intended to keep it. The key issue is the context: the person felt pressured into giving and then had a strong reaction to the sarcasm. \n\nMoral responsibility is tricky here. While the donation was meant for a good cause, the method of collection might have been problematic. The person's frustration with being guilt-tripped could be a valid reaction. However, their response of snatching the money and yelling might have been rude or unnecessary. \n\nIn terms of social norms, interrupting and taking back a donation could be seen as poor conduct, but the initial pressure to donate might justify the reaction. The person might not be entirely at fault because the situation was uncomfortable and the teens' behavior was unprofessional. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards the person not being in the wrong (B), because they were reacting to feeling manipulated, even if their reaction was impulsive. But some might argue they should have handled it differently without taking the money back. However, the key point is the setup by the fundraisers, which could absolve the person's responsibility.\n"
