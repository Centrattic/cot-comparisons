My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe person stayed home to hand out candy on Halloween while their family went trick-or-treating. They encountered some teenagers asking for donations for UNICEF, saying it's for kids in poor countries. The person had only a dollar left and gave it, but the teens acted sarcastically, saying a dollar could feed a village. The author then snatched the dollar back, accused them of guilt-tripping, and slammed the door. Now they're wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the context of Halloween, the unexpected situation, the teens' behavior, and the author's reaction. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, the author wasn't obligated to donate. They offered to give a dollar, but when they saw the teens' sarcastic response, they took it back. That seems like a personal choice. The teens used guilt-tripping tactics, which might have crossed a line. The author felt trapped, which is a valid feeling. But does taking back the money make them wrong?\n\nWell, in terms of legality, there's no issue. Donations are voluntary, and the author can retract them. Morally, maybe the author felt wronged by the teens' approach. The UNICEF collectors might have been using a strategy that the author found manipulative. However, the author's reaction was abrupt and confrontational. Snatching the dollar and yelling might not be the best way to handle it, but does that make them wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author had every right to change their mind about the donation. On the other, their response was harsh. However, the situation might have been tense, and the author's frustration is understandable given the context. The teens' sarcasm could have been provocative. The author's decision to take back the money was a momentary reaction to feeling manipulated.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They acted on their feelings in the heat of the moment. The wrong might lie with the teens for their sarcastic approach. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
