My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. They provided the story where the author gave $1 but then took it back after feeling manipulated by the teenagers who were collecting for UNICEF. The author felt trapped and sarcastic comments from the teens led to their outburst.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they felt pressured into a donation. The teens used guilt-tripping by mentioning poor kids in other countries. The author then took back the dollar, which might seem abrupt, but the reasoning is that they felt manipulated. \n\nThe key points here are the feeling of being coerced and the author's response. The question is whether the author was wrong to take back the donation. On one hand, once you give a donation, it's generally considered a voluntary act. Taking it back could be seen as disrespectful or dishonorable. On the other hand, if the donation was given under duress or manipulation, the author has the right to retract their contribution. \n\nAlso, the teens' behavior\u2014being sarcastic and using a guilt trip\u2014might justify the author's reaction. However, the act of snatching the money back might come off as confrontational. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely at fault because they felt pressured. But taking back a donation isn't a common practice and could be seen as impolite. However, the story does highlight the issue of respectful fundraising practices. \n\nSo, considering that the donation was given under uncomfortable circumstances and the author had a valid reason to feel manipulated, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
