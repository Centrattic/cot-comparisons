My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person stayed home to hand out Halloween candy. Then some teenagers showed up for UNICEF. The person gave them a dollar they had, but then the teens acted sarcastic. The person took back the dollar, said some harsh things, and slammed the door. Now, they're questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main points here. The person initially donated a dollar, which they had on hand. They felt pressured by the teens' sarcastic comment. Taking back the donation after giving it seems a bit odd. But why?\n\nThe key here is the context. The donor had only a dollar, which they gave but then felt manipulated. The teens' behavior might have been inappropriate. Guilt-tripping people during Halloween? That could be a factor. The donor's reaction was strong, but maybe justified if they felt coerced.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong. Legally, once you hand over money as a donation, you can't typically take it back unless it's fraudulent. But this is more about social ethics. The donor's action of taking back the dollar could be seen as rude, but their reasoning was that they felt trapped into donating. Also, the teens' approach was questionable. They mentioned \"poor kids in other countries\" during a time when those kids don't celebrate Halloween. So maybe the donor is right to feel that UNICEF was exploiting the situation.\n\nBut then, is the donor in the wrong for taking back the donation? Well, if the donation was given under duress, maybe not. But the donor could have chosen to not give rather than take it back after. However, the fact that the teens were using a manipulative tactic might make the donor's decision defensible.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the donor felt coerced and the teens' approach was problematic. The donor's reaction, while strong, was a response to perceived manipulation. The main issue is the method of fundraising by the teens, not the donor's action of retracting the donation.\n"
