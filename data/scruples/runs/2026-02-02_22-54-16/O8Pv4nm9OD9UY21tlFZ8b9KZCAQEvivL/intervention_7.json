My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was trick-or-treating alone, gave out candy, and then encountered teenagers collecting for UNICEF. The author had only $1, gave it, but then the teens were sarcastic, which made the author uncomfortable. The author then took the dollar back, criticized their approach, and shut the door.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author gave a dollar, but felt manipulated. The teens' sarcastic comment about feeding a village might have made the author feel disrespected. The author's reaction was to snatch the money back and express frustration about UNICEF's methods. \n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to retract a donation if they felt pressured. It's their money, and they can choose how to use it. The sarcastic comment might have crossed a line, making the donation feel coerced. So, the author's action could be seen as a response to that pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, once the author gave the money, even if out of discomfort, taking it back might be seen as rude. The teens might have been doing their job, even if their tone was off. However, the author's reaction was in the moment, perhaps a split-second decision. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The key factors are intent and context. The author felt guilt-tripped, which is a common criticism of certain fundraising tactics. Retracting the donation isn't necessarily wrong if the donation was made under pressure. Also, the teens' behavior was unprofessional, which might justify the author's reaction.\n\nSo considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to change their mind, especially if they felt manipulated. The answer would be B.\n"
