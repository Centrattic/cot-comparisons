My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation.\n\nFirst, the context: The person was trick-or-treating alone and gave out candy. Then a couple of older teenagers came, asking for a donation to UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The person felt pressured, gave a dollar, then took it back because they felt it was a scam. They slammed the door and felt bad afterward. \n\nNow, the key points here. The author gave a dollar but then took it back. So the main issue is whether it's wrong to take back a donation once given. Also, there's the method they used\u2014snatching the dollar and shutting the door. \n\nLegally, once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction. Taking it back might not be allowed unless there was fraud. But UNICEF is a legitimate organization, so the problem here is more about the situation and the author's actions.\n\nEthically, the author was pressured by the collectors' approach. The collectors might have used manipulative language, which could make the author feel coerced. However, the author chose to give the dollar initially. Then, taking it back might be seen as breaking a commitment, which could be considered rude or dishonest. \n\nBut from another angle, if the donation was made under duress or the person felt tricked, they might have a right to retract it. However, once the dollar is given, it's theirs to take back if feasible. The problem is the aggressive way they took it back\u2014snatching it and slamming the door. That's confrontational and could be seen as rude or aggressive, even if they felt wronged.\n\nSo, the author's actions were impulsive and disrespectful towards the collectors. The initial donation was made, and then they retracted it in a manner that could be seen as dishonest or confrontational. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their behavior, even if they felt pressured initially.\n"
