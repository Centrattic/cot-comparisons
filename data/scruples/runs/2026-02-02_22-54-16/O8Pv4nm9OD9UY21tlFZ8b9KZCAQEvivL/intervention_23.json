My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was giving out Halloween candy while their family was out. Some teenagers came trick-or-treating but for UNICEF, trying to get donations by guilt-tripping about poor kids not having Halloween. The author gave a dollar, but the teens mocked it. Then the author snatched the dollar back and shut the door. Now they're questioning if they were wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author gave a donation, then took it back after being mocked. The UNICEF representatives were using guilt-tripping tactics, which the author found manipulative. The author felt uncomfortable and reacted emotionally. Some might argue that once a donation is given, taking it back is unkind or not charitable. Charities usually rely on donations, so reclaiming them could be seen as undermining their cause.\n\nOn the other hand, the teenagers were teenagers, possibly just doing their school project. The author felt tricked into donating with guilt, which is a common criticism of certain fundraising tactics. The mocking response from the teens might have justified the author's reaction. Also, the author pointed out that UNICEF's approach was exploitative, which is a valid ethical concern. People have the right to feel pressured into donating and to change their minds if they feel the method is unethical.\n\nConsiderations: Was the author's reaction proportionate? Taking back the dollar after giving it could be seen as a personal choice, especially if they felt manipulated. However, the act of snatching it back and shutting the door might come off as rude or abrupt. The key here is the context of the pressure and the teens' behavior.\n\nAlso, the author admitted to feeling like an asshole afterward, which shows some self-awareness. But the core issue is the ethics of the donation and the pressure applied. If the charity's method was indeed manipulative, the author isn't necessarily wrong for withdrawing support.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often react based on their feelings in the moment. The author acted on their discomfort with the pressure and the teens' sarcasm. It's a judgment call between respecting the charity's methods versus the donor's right to feel pressured.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reaction might have been impulsive, the underlying issue of being guilt-tripped into a donation is a common concern. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're reacting to what they perceived as manipulation. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
