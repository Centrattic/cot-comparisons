My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back a UNICEF donation they gave during Halloween. Here's the situation: They stayed home to give out candy while their family went trick-or-treating. When some older kids came asking for donations for UNICEF, they felt pressured, gave a dollar but then took it back when the kids mocked them with a sarcastic comment about feeding a village.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Donations are typically voluntary. The person gave the dollar initially, so that was a donation. But then they took it back because they felt tricked or manipulated. Is that allowed? Well, once a donation is given, it's supposed to be a gift. However, in this case, the person took the money back right after giving it, so maybe it's not a final transaction. The sarcastic comment might have been a factor in their decision.\n\nAnother angle: The UNICEF collectors used guilt-tripping tactics, which the person found manipulative. The collector's behavior (mocking the donation) might have been inappropriate, making the initial donation feel coerced. If the donation wasn't given freely, some might argue it's not valid. But the person's reaction of taking back the money could be seen as rude or confrontational. However, given the context, they might have felt disrespected.\n\nAlso, the person was alone, and the collectors were teenagers. Their emotional response to feeling trapped and then realizing the donation might be for a different purpose than they intended (since they mentioned third-world countries not celebrating Halloween) could justify their actions. \n\nBut then, is it right to take back a donation? Legally, maybe not, but morally, if the donation was made under duress, perhaps it's understandable. The person is conflicted, feeling like an asshole but also feeling manipulated.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the donation was given in a pressured situation and then retracted due to feeling manipulated. The collectors' sarcastic behavior justified the person's reaction. They had the right to retract the donation since it hadn't been handed over permanently and the context involved coercion.\n"
