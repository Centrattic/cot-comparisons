My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The person stayed home to hand out Halloween candy. They gave out a bowl of candy as usual. Then some teenagers came, asked for a donation for UNICEF, made a sarcastic comment about the dollar being enough to feed a village. The author then took back the dollar, said some harsh words, and slammed the door.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider different angles.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They were put on the spot, maybe felt pressured by the guilt-tripping comment. They might have felt disrespected by the teens' sarcasm. They gave a dollar but then took it back because they felt it was being misused. Also, they mentioned that the teens were using Halloween, which is a Western tradition, to solicit for a cause that's not directly related (since third world kids don't celebrate Halloween). That part could be a point about the relevance of the cause in that context.\n\nOn the other side, the teenagers were collecting for UNICEF, which is a legitimate charity. They might have been doing their job, even if their tone was sarcastic. The author gave the dollar, then took it back. Legally, once a donation is given, can you take it back? That's a question. If the author physically took back the money, that could be seen as theft, depending on the circumstances. But if they took it back immediately, maybe it's more of a retraction.\n\nEthically, the author might argue that they were misled or pressured into donating. The teenagers used guilt-tripping tactics, which could be seen as manipulative. However, the author could also be seen as rude for the way they reacted, slamming the door and using harsh language.\n\nAnother angle: The author's comment about the cost of candy vs. the donation. They gave $1, which they now want to re-evaluate based on the value of the candy. But once a donation is made, it's generally expected to be given in good faith.\n\nThe author's justification for taking back the money is that the teens were using guilt to get donations for a cause that's not directly related to Halloween. But UNICEF does work with children globally, and their collection during Halloween is a known tradition in some areas. The author might not have been aware that it's a common practice, but the reaction was confrontational.\n\nAlso, the act of snatching the dollar back could be seen as aggressive. Even if the author felt wronged, the method of taking back the money was rude and possibly illegal if the donation had already been transferred.\n\nBut in terms of moral responsibility, the author might feel justified if they believe the collection was exploiting the situation. However, others might argue that the teens were just doing their part for a good cause and the author had a right to decline donation in a polite manner instead of being confrontational.\n\nSo considering all this, the author's actions were rude and potentially illegal (if taking back a donated item), but their motivation was based on feeling misled. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on whether the act of taking back the donation is considered acceptable. Since once given, a donation is usually considered a completed transaction, taking it back could be seen as wrong. However, the initial donation was under duress, which complicates things.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to retract a donation they felt pressured into giving. However, the method was inappropriate. So maybe the author is in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if their feelings are understandable. So answer A (Yes) might be correct.\n"
