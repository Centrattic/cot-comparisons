My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who donated a dollar to UNICEF during trick-or-treating but then took it back because the teens were being sarcastic and guilt-tripping them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author gave out candy normally and then these older kids came asking for UNICEF donations. The author only had a dollar and gave it, but the teens mocked the amount. The author then took back the dollar and slammed the door. \n\nNow, the question is if the author was wrong. On one hand, the author had the right to decide how much to donate. They might have felt pressured and the teens' sarcasm was disrespectful. The author's reaction was to reclaim the money, which might be seen as impolite, but they also weren't obligated to give in the first place. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did give a dollar initially, then took it back. Maybe they felt manipulated and wanted to stand up for themselves. The UNICEF kids might have been doing their job, but the way they did it was sarcastic, which could justify the author's frustration. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't in the wrong because they had the right to retract their donation if they felt it was given under pressure. The teens' behavior was inappropriate, so the author's response, while maybe harsh, was a reaction to that. So the answer is B.\n"
