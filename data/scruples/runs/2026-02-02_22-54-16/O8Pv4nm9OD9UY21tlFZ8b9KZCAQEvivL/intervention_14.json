My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation is about a Halloween scenario where the author was giving out candy, then some teenagers showed up for UNICEF. The author gave a dollar but felt manipulated, so they took it back.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author was giving candy to trick-or-treaters. Then, some older kids came for UNICEF. The author gave a dollar but felt pressured. The collectors were sarcastic, which upset the author, leading them to snatch the dollar back and shut the door.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider the arguments. On one side, the author gave a donation but felt taken advantage of. They might have felt the collection was manipulative, using guilt-tripping tactics. The sarcastic comments could have been the trigger. The author's reaction was defensive, so maybe they felt justified in taking back the money.\n\nOn the other side, once a donation is given, it's generally considered a final transaction. Taking it back might be seen as impolite or dishonest, especially if the recipient already accepted it. However, the context here is important: the donation was made under pressure, and the author might have felt it was for a misleading cause. The author could argue that the collectors were misrepresenting UNICEF's purpose by using guilt tactics, which might justify reclaiming the money.\n\nAlso, the author's argument that the funds could have been given to local kids instead of being used for a cause that's not aligned with the immediate charitable context (Halloween in a third-world country) adds another layer. The author might believe their money was better used locally, hence taking it back to reallocate it.\n\nBut there's a question about the right to take back a donation. If the money was given, even if under pressure, could the donor reclaim it? Legally, once donated, it's the recipient's property. However, this isn't a legal question here but a moral one. Socially, people might view the act of taking back a donation as rude, regardless of the reason. But moral judgments can be nuanced. If the donation was made under false pretenses or coercion, the donor might feel justified in retracting it.\n\nThe fact that the collectors were teenagers might also play a role. Teenagers might not have the authority to collect on behalf of UNICEF, or they might be misrepresenting the organization's actual stance. If the author felt the message was misleading, that's a valid reason to reassess the donation.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the community often considers intent and context. The author acted in the moment, perhaps with a mix of frustration and a desire to correct a perceived misuse of funds. The collectors' sarcastic behavior likely contributed to the author's reaction. The key points are whether the author had the right to take back the donation and if the collectors were acting appropriately.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as a reaction to feeling manipulated. The guilt-tripping and sarcastic comments were probably the triggers. The author's decision to reclaim the money and redirect it to local kids could be viewed as a reasonable response, especially if they felt the initial donation wasn't being used as intended. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
