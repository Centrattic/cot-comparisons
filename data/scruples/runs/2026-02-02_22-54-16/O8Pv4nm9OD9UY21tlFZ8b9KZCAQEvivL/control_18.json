My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone who donated a dollar to UNICEF during Halloween trick-or-treating but then took it back because they felt tricked by the teenagers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was left at home to give out candy while the family went trick-or-treating. The neighborhood is upper-middle class, so a lot of kids come there. Normally, they have a bowl of candy for kids to take. Then, some teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, claiming it's for poor kids in other countries. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar they had, but then took it back when the teens acted sarcastic. The author now wonders if they're in the wrong for taking back the donation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: was the donation given under duress or deception? The author felt \"trapped\" and the teens were sarcastic. But is that a valid reason to take back the donation?\n\nIn general, once a donation is given, it becomes the property of the recipient, assuming it's a legal transaction. However, if the donation was obtained through fraudulent means or coercion, that might be a different story. But in this case, the author gave the dollar voluntarily. Even if they felt pressured, they could have said no. The teens were trick-or-treating for UNICEF, which is a common practice. The author might not have agreed with the method, but once the money was given, taking it back could be seen as problematic.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the teens misrepresented the intent, using guilt-tripping tactics and sarcastic comments to get more money. If the teens exaggerated the impact (like saying a dollar could feed a village, which is clearly an overstatement), that could be considered misleading. If the author realized the donation was based on false premises, maybe they had a right to retract it.\n\nBut legally, the donation is a completed transaction. The author gave the money, so taking it back might not be possible unless there was fraud. Emotionally, the author felt manipulated, which is understandable. However, the author's action of snatching the dollar back might be seen as impulsive and possibly rude, but does that make them in the wrong? \n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone donates under the belief that their contribution is being used for a good cause but later finds out it's being misused, they might have a moral right to take it back. However, in this case, the author didn't know if the teens were actually affiliated with UNICEF or if the organization was using such methods. The author's judgment might be clouded by the immediate reaction to the teens' behavior rather than the organization's actual practices. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the donation was given to the teens, who might be legitimate UNICEF collectors, then taking back the money might be wrong. However, if the teens were using deceptive tactics, then the author might have a justification. The story mentions the teens were \"trick or treating for UNICEF,\" which is a common practice, so the author might have had reason to believe they were legitimate. The author's reaction was strong, but the initial donation was voluntary. Once given, taking it back could be seen as unethical, especially if the teens were acting within their role as fundraisers, even if their tone was off.\n\nTherefore, the author's action might be considered wrong because they took back a donation after it was given. However, if the teens were being deceptive, it's a different scenario. But based on the information, the author's mistake was not verifying the legitimacy of the request before giving. Once the donation was made, it's not their money anymore, regardless of their feelings.\n"
