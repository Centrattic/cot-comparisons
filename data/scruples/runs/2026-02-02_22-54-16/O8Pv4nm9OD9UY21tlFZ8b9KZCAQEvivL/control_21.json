My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation in the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author was staying home to give out Halloween candy while their family was out. When two teenagers came trick-or-treating, they asked for a donation for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping language. The author gave a dollar but then took it back after the teens mocked the donation. The author felt justified but is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author gave a donation, then took it back after the teens' sarcastic comment. The core issue is whether the author had the right to retract the donation once it was given.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction. The author can't take it back unless there's some specific agreement allowing that. Ethically, it's about whether the author was under pressure or manipulation.\n\nThe UNICEF representatives used guilt-tripping, which might have made the author feel coerced. However, the author chose to give initially. Even if they felt pressured, once the money was handed over, taking it back might not be acceptable. The author could have refused to give in the first place if they felt uncomfortable. But after giving, retraction could be seen as inappropriate unless there was a mistake or fraud, which isn't indicated here.\n\nAnother angle is the teens' behavior. Their sarcastic remarks were disrespectful. The author's reaction might be defensible as a response to that. However, the donation was already made, so taking it back might not be justified.\n\nThe author could argue that the donation was made under duress, but that's a legal term that usually requires a more direct threat. Here, it's more about emotional pressure. Even so, once the money is given, the author can't take it back. The author's mistake was not standing their ground initially.\n\nSo, the author's action of taking back the donation after giving it might be considered wrong because it's not appropriate to retract a donation post-transaction. However, the ethical judgment might be more nuanced, considering the context. But legally and in terms of social norms, retracting a donation after it's given is not acceptable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
