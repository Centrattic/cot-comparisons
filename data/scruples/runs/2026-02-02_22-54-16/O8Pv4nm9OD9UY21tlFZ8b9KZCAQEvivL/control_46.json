My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author was trick-or-treating and encountered some teenagers collecting for UNICEF. The kids made a sarcastic comment about the dollar being able to feed a village, which annoyed the author. The author then snatched back the dollar and slammed the door, feeling conflicted afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author gave a dollar initially, which is a donation. The teenagers then used a sarcastic remark, which the author found offensive. The author took back the money, feeling that the UNICEF representatives were guilt-tripping people. \n\nNow, the key points here are the author's actions and the context. Donating to a charity is a personal choice, and the author did give a dollar. However, after the encounter, they decided to retract it. Legally, once a donation is given, it typically belongs to the recipient. So taking it back might not be legally permissible. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, which is more about moral or ethical considerations.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might argue that they felt manipulated and wanted to withdraw their support. However, the teenagers were acting on behalf of UNICEF, which is a legitimate charity. The sarcasm might have been unprofessional, but does that justify taking back the donation? \n\nOn the other hand, the author had the right to decide whether to donate. Once the donation was made, retracting it might be seen as problematic because it could undermine the charity's efforts. The author could have chosen not to donate in the first place if they felt uncomfortable. \n\nBut the situation was during trick-or-treating, which is a public event. The teenagers were likely following a script or a method to collect donations. The author's reaction might stem from feeling pressured, but the charity's approach might be standard. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's action might be seen as impulsive and not well-considered. However, if they genuinely felt that the donation was coerced through guilt-tripping, their reaction could be somewhat understandable. \n\nUltimately, the question hinges on whether retracting a donation given under questionable circumstances is acceptable. Since the author had no legal right to take back the money, but ethically, they might feel justified, the answer could be nuanced. However, charities typically rely on voluntary donations, and the author's decision to donate was their choice. Once given, retracting it might not be appropriate, even if the collector's manner was off-putting.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "The author made a voluntary donation, which they gave under the belief it was for UNICEF. While the teenagers\u2019 sarcastic delivery was unprofessional, the author cannot unilaterally retract a donation after it has been given. The decision to donate is personal, but once a donation is made, it is not ethically acceptable to take it back. The author\u2019s anger and impulse to snatch the money back were misguided, as the donation was already a completed transaction. The appropriate action would have been to refuse the donation altogether at the time of the request. **Answer A** (the author is in the wrong).",
