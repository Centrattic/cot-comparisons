My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The scenario involves the author giving out Halloween candy while their family is away. They encounter some teenagers who come for UNICEF donations, and the interaction turns tense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author gave a dollar, which was then mocked by the teens. They then took the dollar back, criticized the UNICEF representatives for guilt-tripping, and slammed the door. The author feels conflicted afterward, questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, what's the right approach here? Let's look at the actions. The author initially donated a dollar, which is a small amount. The UNICEF representatives used a guilt-tripping tactic, which the author found manipulative. The author then took back the money, which might be seen as reclaiming their donation after realizing the method was unethical. \n\nLegally, taking back a donation isn't a crime. The author isn't obligated to keep the money once given, especially if they feel it's being misused. The UNICEF reps' sarcastic remark might have crossed a line, making the author feel pressured. The author's response was defensive, pointing out the hypocrisy of focusing on third-world countries during Halloween, which isn't celebrated there. That seems like a valid counterpoint.\n\nEthically, the situation is more nuanced. The author might feel justified in retracting the donation after realizing the approach was manipulative. However, the act of snatching the money back could be seen as aggressive. But considering the context\u2014being in their home, feeling targeted, and the disrespectful behavior of the teens\u2014their reaction is understandable.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the teens were legitimate UNICEF representatives, the author could still have refused the donation initially. But since they were teenagers possibly acting on their own, the author's response is more about protecting themselves from a manipulative situation. There's no indication the author is against donating in general; they just took issue with the method.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look for whether the person acted in bad faith. Here, the author acted based on their discomfort with the tactics used. They didn't cause harm beyond taking back their money. So, the likely answer is B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that once money is given, taking it back could be problematic. But given the circumstances, the author's actions seem justified as a response to manipulation.\n"
