My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the context: The person stayed home to give out candy on Halloween while their family went trick-or-treating. When some older trick-or-treaters showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, the author gave them a dollar but then took it back after the teens sarcastically exaggerated the impact of the dollar. The author then shut the door, feeling conflicted afterward.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author donated $1, then took it back after the teens' sarcastic comment. The question is whether that action was wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author initially gave the money, so taking it back might be seen as ungrateful or dishonest. On the other hand, the teens' behavior was manipulative and possibly misleading, which could justify the author's reaction, especially if they felt pressured into the donation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling trapped and later realizing the situation was being used to guilt-trip people. The sarcastic remark about feeding a village with a dollar might have been a prank to make people feel bad, which could have been a factor in the author's decision to take back the money.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of etiquette. Once you give money, it's generally expected to be a completed transaction. Taking it back could be seen as abrupt and rude, even if provoked. However, if the donation was made under false pretenses (like the teens lying about how the money is used), that's different. The author argues that UNICEF was using guilt-tripping, which the author felt was manipulative.\n\nLegally, there's probably no issue, but socially, it's a gray area. The author's actions might be seen as justified given the context, but the method of taking the money back (snatching it and shutting the door) was harsh.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have handled it better by not giving the money in the first place if they were uncomfortable, but they did donate. The reaction was impulsive, which might lead to mixed opinions.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and context. The author's intention was to help but felt manipulated. The teens' behavior was inappropriate, so the author's response, while abrupt, might be seen as a legitimate reaction to being tricked into a donation.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They acted in the moment due to feeling manipulated, and the teens' actions were questionable. The answer would be B.\n"
