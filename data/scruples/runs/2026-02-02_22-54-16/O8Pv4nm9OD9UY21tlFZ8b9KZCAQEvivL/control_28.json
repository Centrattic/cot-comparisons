My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation was in the wrong. The scenario involves a Halloween setup where the author gives out candy while their family is away. Then, some teens come trick-or-treating but instead of candy, they ask for a donation to UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar but then took it back, called out the teens for being sarcastic, and slammed the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author donated money but later decided to take it back. Normally, once money is given, it's considered a gift unless there's an agreement for it to be returned. The teens were acting on behalf of UNICEF, but their approach was confrontational and sarcastic, which might have contributed to the author's decision.\n\nUNICEF is a legitimate charity, but the way the donation was solicited here seems problematic. The teens' sarcastic comments about the dollar feeding a village might have been mocking the situation rather than genuine fundraising. The author felt trapped and the interaction was uncomfortable. Taking back the money in response to that pressure could be seen as a reaction to the unprofessional behavior of the solicitors, not necessarily a rejection of the cause itself.\n\nHowever, the act of taking back a donation after it's been given could be seen as untrustworthy. But in this case, the donation was made under duress and the author immediately took back the money. There's a line between standing up for oneself in a manipulative situation and breaching a trust. The key points are the pressure tactic used by the teens and the immediate reversal of the donation. The author's intent was to resist being guilt-tripped, not to harm the charity. So, the author's actions might be justifiable given the circumstances.\n"
