My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation is about Halloween trick-or-treating where the author stayed home to hand out candy. Some teenagers showed up asking for UNICEF donations, and the author felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then got annoyed when the teens mocked the donation. The author took back the dollar and shut the door, feeling guilty afterward but still thinking UNICEF was using guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel they were manipulated into giving by the teens' guilt-tripping. The teens used a sarcastic comment about a dollar feeding a village, which could be seen as mocking the donor. The author's reaction was immediate and emotional\u2014snatching the dollar back and cutting them off. \n\nOn the other hand, UNICEF is a reputable organization, so even if the teens acted inappropriately, taking back the donation might be seen as undermining their cause. But the problem here is the manner in which the teens collected. If they were using sarcasm and tricking people, that's not ethical fundraising. The author might have felt disrespected and acted on impulse. \n\nThe key points: the teens misused their role as UNICEF representatives, the author felt pressured and then regretted the donation. Taking back the money could be justified as a reaction to the manipulation. But in terms of UNICEF's policy, if the donation wasn't processed yet (just cash given directly), the author might have the right to reclaim it. However, if the teens were official collectors, the author might be breaching their privacy or being rude. \n\nThe author's actions were impulsive but perhaps understandable given the situation. The guilt-tripping and mockery from the teens were inappropriate. The author's response was harsh but a direct reaction to feeling taken advantage of. So overall, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were reacting to an unfair situation. The answer would be B, No.\n"
