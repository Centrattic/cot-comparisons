My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Halloween, right? The author stayed home to hand out candy while their family went trick-or-treating. In their upper-middle-class neighborhood, other kids come for better candy, which they support. The problem arises when some teenage trick-or-treaters show up and ask for a donation to UNICEF, using guilt-tripping by saying it's for poor kids in other countries.\n\nThe author had a dollar in their wallet, gave it, but then the teens acted sarcastically, saying a dollar could feed a village. The author took the dollar back, criticized the UNICEF approach, and shut the door. Now they're wondering if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants an opinion.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. Halloween is a time for kids to collect candy, and UNICEF's trick-or-treat program is a well-known fundraising effort. But the author was already giving out candy as a treat. The teens came for the candy, but instead, they asked for a donation. The author felt pressured and didn't like the way the request was made, especially the sarcasm from the teens. \n\nThe author's action of taking the dollar back might be seen as abrupt. But maybe they felt manipulated. The key points here are: Did the author have an obligation to donate, and was their reaction justified? On one hand, the teens might have been doing their job as part of the UNICEF program, but their tone and behavior were unprofessional and sarcastic. The author was giving out candy, so the teens' approach might have been a bit of a \"trick\" by asking for money instead. \n\nThe author's response, while harsh, could be a reaction to feeling tricked. But is it okay to take back a donation once given? That's a bit iffy. However, the author might have felt that the donation was coerced. The question is about whether the author was wrong in reclaiming the money. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone gives a donation but later feels it was under duress, they might have the right to take it back. However, the initial act of giving could be considered a choice, even if they felt pressured. The author's criticism of the UNICEF approach might be valid if the organization's representatives were being insincere. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the teens were legitimate UNICEF representatives, then maybe the author's reaction was too strong. However, if the teens were just using the UNICEF name in a manipulative way, the author's response could be justified. The story mentions they were teenagers, so maybe they weren't official UNICEF representatives. \n\nAlso, the author was giving out candy, so maybe the teens were trying to redirect that effort into a donation. The author's point about third-world kids not celebrating Halloween might be a bit of a stretch, but it's possible. The main issue here is the manner in which the donation was requested. If the teens used a guilt trip and sarcasm, the author might feel disrespected. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be seen as self-defense from feeling coerced. While retracted donations can be ethically questionable, if the donation was made under pressure, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for taking it back. The sarcastic behavior of the teens might have overstepped, making the author's reaction understandable. So probably answer B: No.\n"
