My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation involves a Halloween setup where the author gives out candy. Then, some older trick-or-treaters ask for UNICEF donations, which the author feels is manipulative. The teens mock the $1 donation, and the author takes the money back and slams the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a position where they were giving out candy as part of Halloween, a time when people generally expect to give treats. The UNICEF kids approached with a guilt-tripping tactic, which the author found offensive. The author then takes back the dollar, which they felt was coerced.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, donating to UNICEF is a noble cause, but the way the teens presented it might have been manipulative. The author felt trapped and then took back the money because they didn't want to support what they saw as exploitation. \n\nBut legally, once you give money as a donation, it's theirs. Taking it back after the fact could be an issue. However, in this case, the author immediately took it back, so maybe there's a different angle. Morally, the author had the right to refuse to donate if they felt uncomfortable, especially if the collection method was coercive. The UNICEF kids used a tactic that made the author feel guilty, which can be seen as problematic. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning was that the UNICEF kids were misrepresenting the cause by linking Halloween (which isn't celebrated in many third-world countries) to their donation drive. That might have been another point of contention. The author might have felt that the method of fundraising was misleading.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they had the right to withdraw their donation immediately if they felt it was obtained under false pretenses or coercion. However, some might argue that the author should have just not donated in the first place instead of taking it back. But given the circumstances, the author's reaction is understandable. The key points are the immediate withdrawal and the perceived manipulation by the UNICEF teens. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
