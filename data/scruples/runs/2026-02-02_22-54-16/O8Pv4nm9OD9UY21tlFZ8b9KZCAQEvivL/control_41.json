My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context is Halloween, where the author was giving out candy while their family was trick-or-treating. They encountered some teenagers asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author gave a dollar but then took it back when they felt the approach was manipulative. Now, they're questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, donating to UNICEF is a charitable act, and retracting a donation after it's been given might seem unethical. People might argue that once you give money, it's theirs, and taking it back could be seen as disrespectful or a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation here is a bit different. The teenagers used a manipulative and sarcastic approach to get donations, which made the author uncomfortable. The author felt pressured into giving and then took back the money because they believed the organization was exploiting the moment with guilt-tripping tactics. In this case, the donation wasn't a voluntary act but rather a response to a manipulative situation. Some might argue that if a donation is given under pressure, the person has the right to reclaim it, especially if they feel it's being misused.\n\nAnother angle is the method of donation. If someone approaches you with a guilt-trip, and you feel coerced into giving, that's different from a genuine donation. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they feel the UNICEF representatives were taking advantage of the Halloween context to guilt-trip people instead of explaining the actual cause properly.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of respecting the donation process. Even if the approach was unpleasant, once the money is handed over, some would say it's not appropriate to take it back. But since the author immediately took it back upon realizing the manipulation, maybe it's more about the immediacy and the intent behind the donation.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author was in a position where they were alone giving out candy, maybe not expecting such a situation. They had to react in the moment, and their response was a mix of frustration and wanting to stop the manipulation. The community might have mixed reactions. Some would support the author for standing up against pressure tactics, others might think that once given, the donation was a valid act.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the key points are the voluntariness of the donation and the manipulation involved. If the donation wasn't voluntary due to pressure tactics, then retracting it might be justified. However, the act of taking back a donation after it's been given could be seen as rude, regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer isn't straightforward. But since the donation was given under what the author perceives as manipulation, and they took it back immediately, some might argue they are not in the wrong. Others might say they should have considered the consequences of retracting a donation in such a situation. Given the context, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
