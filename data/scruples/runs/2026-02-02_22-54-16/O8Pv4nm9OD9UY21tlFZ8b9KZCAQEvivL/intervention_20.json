My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author taking back a donation they gave to UNICEF during Halloween trick-or-treating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was giving out candy to trick-or-treaters. When some teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, the author gave them a dollar. The teens responded sarcastically, making a comment about feeding a village with a dollar. The author then took back the dollar, gave them a harsh response, and slammed the door. Now they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are the author's actions and the context. The author gave a dollar, felt manipulated by the teens' sarcastic remarks, and then took back the money. The question is whether that was wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author might have felt pressured or taken advantage of, especially if the teens were using guilt-tripping tactics. On the other hand, once the donation was given, even if it was done under pressure, taking it back could be seen as rude or inconsiderate. But maybe the author's reaction was justified because they felt manipulated.\n\nAnother angle: The teens were representing UNICEF. If they were using sarcasm or mocking the donor, that's unprofessional and might have contributed to the author's reaction. The author's frustration with being guilt-tripped is understandable. However, the act of snatching back the money and shutting the door might have been an overreaction, even if the author felt wronged.\n\nI should also think about the norms of donations. Once a donation is given, it's generally considered a completed transaction. Taking it back could be seen as a breach of trust or etiquette. However, if the donation was made under false pretenses or manipulation, the donor might feel justified in retracting it. But in this case, the author gave the donation on the spot, not after a formal pledge, so the situation is different.\n\nThe author's comment about third-world kids not celebrating Halloween might also be a point. They're pointing out the hypocrisy of the teens focusing on a Western holiday while asking for charitable donations. That could be a valid point, but the way they expressed it was confrontational.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a judgment call. Some might argue that once the money is given, even if reluctantly, the author shouldn't take it back. Others might see the author's actions as a reasonable response to feeling manipulated. The key factors are the manipulation by the teens and the author's emotional reaction to it.\n\nI think the author's actions were a reaction to feeling pressured, which can be frustrating. However, the act of taking back the money after the fact, even if justified by the situation, could be seen as inconsiderate. But since the author acknowledges feeling like an asshole afterward, there's a sense of remorse, which might mitigate the wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering all this, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they felt manipulated and the donation was given under pressure. The response, while perhaps harsh, was a reaction to perceived manipulation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
