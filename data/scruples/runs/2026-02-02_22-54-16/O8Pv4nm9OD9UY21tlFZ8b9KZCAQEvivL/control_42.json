My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person stayed home during Halloween to hand out candy. When some older trick-or-treaters showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, they were sarcastic, took the dollar given, and left. The author then snatched the dollar back, was rude, and slammed the door.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author gave a dollar, which they later took back. The question is whether they were wrong to do so. \n\nLegally, once a donation is given, it's usually a completed transaction. If you give money to someone, you can't just take it back unless there's some agreement or legal recourse, which there isn't in this case. So from a legal standpoint, taking back the money might be problematic. Ethically, it's about intent. The author felt tricked or guilty into donating, so they took back the money. But once the money was given, even if the author felt pressured, can they retract it? That's a gray area. \n\nThe UNICEF collectors used a guilt-tripping approach, which the author found manipulative. However, the collectors were likely following a script or method assigned by their organization. The author's reaction was strong\u2014snatching the money and being confrontational. Even if they felt wronged, acting in a rude manner could be seen as the problem. \n\nThe author might argue that the donation wasn't genuine because they felt coerced. But in charitable giving, once the money is handed over, it's considered a gift, even if the context was uncomfortable. The collectors might have overstepped by being sarcastic, but the author's response was aggressive. \n\nAnother angle: the author gave the dollar, perhaps out of habit, but then realized they didn't want to support that cause. However, taking back the money could be seen as unethical because the donation was already made. The collectors might have a right to keep the money they received. \n\nAlso, the author's method of taking back the money was confrontational. Even if they felt wronged, confronting the collectors in a rude manner could be seen as the author's fault. The collectors might have been doing their job, albeit poorly, and the author's response escalated the situation. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because once the donation was made, retracting it is inappropriate, and their response was rude. The collectors' behavior was unprofessional, but the author's reaction was also unkind. So the answer would be A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
