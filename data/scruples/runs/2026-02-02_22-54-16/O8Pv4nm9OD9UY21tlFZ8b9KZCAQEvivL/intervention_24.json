My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo the author was home giving out candy on Halloween while their family was out trick-or-treating. They had a bowl of candy for kids to grab, which they enjoyed because it's full-sized bars. Then, some teenage trick-or-treaters came, asked for a donation for UNICEF, using a guilt-tripping line about poor kids not being able to trick-or-treat. The author had only $1 in their wallet, gave it, but then one of the teens acted sarcastically, holding up the dollar and exaggerating its value. The author took the dollar back, got angry, and shut the door.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reaction to the perceived manipulation. The author felt trapped and was upset about the sarcastic comment. They took the dollar back, which is the main action in question. \n\nNow, I need to consider the ethics here. Donations are voluntary, and the author initially gave the dollar. However, the manner in which the donation was solicited might have been problematic. The teens used guilt-tripping, and their sarcastic reaction after receiving the donation could have escalated the situation. The author's frustration is understandable if they felt manipulated.\n\nBut is taking the donation back justified? Once a donation is given, it's usually considered a completed transaction. However, the context here is a bit different because the author was in the middle of the interaction and felt the donation was part of a manipulative tactic. The author's anger might have caused them to snatch the dollar back, which is impulsive, but the intent was to retract the donation due to the perceived exploitation.\n\nUNICEF's role here is as a third party. If the teens were soliciting on behalf of UNICEF, then the organization's methods might be questionable. However, the author's direct action is taking back the money. The question is whether the author overstepped by doing that.\n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to decline donating in the first place. They did donate but then changed their mind. That's possible, but once a donation is given, retraction isn't typical. However, in this case, the donation was immediately retracted, so it's more like a refusal. The author might not be in the wrong because they felt pressured and the solicitation method was inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author acted in a confrontational manner. Snatching the dollar and shutting the door could be seen as aggressive. But considering the context of feeling manipulated and the sarcastic comments, some might argue the author had a valid reason.\n\nI think the main factors are the pressure tactics used by the teens and the author's response. If the UNICEF approach was guilt-based and manipulative, the author's decision to retract the donation isn't in the wrong. The key is whether the author had the right to take it back. Since donations can be revoked if given under duress, the author might not be at fault. So, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
