My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation involves a Halloween scenario where the person gave a dollar to UNICEF trick-or-treaters but then took it back when the teens made a sarcastic comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was giving out candy to trick-or-treaters, and these teens approached for UNICEF. They gave a dollar but felt pressured, then took it back when the teens made a sarcastic remark about feeding a village. The person shut the door, feeling guilty afterward but stood by their action.\n\nThe key points here are the initial donation, the reaction to the teens' sarcasm, and the decision to take back the money. Legally, once a donation is made, it's a gift and can't be reclaimed unless there's an agreement. But morally, it's different. The person felt manipulated, so taking back the money might be seen as a reaction to feeling coerced. However, physically taking it back after giving could be seen as rude or confrontational.\n\nUNICEF's trick-or-treating is a known method to collect donations, but if the teens were using guilt-tripping tactics, that's a problem. The person might not be in the wrong for withdrawing support if they felt pressured. But the manner in which they took back the money\u2014snatching it and shutting the door\u2014could be seen as aggressive. It's a balance between the right to retract a donation and the method used.\n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, if someone feels they were misled or pressured, they might have a justification to take back the money. However, the act of taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer might hinge on whether the person's actions were justified given the context of feeling manipulated. The community might side with the person if they believe the teens were exploiting the situation, but the method of taking back the money could be criticized. The final answer would need to weigh these factors.\n"
