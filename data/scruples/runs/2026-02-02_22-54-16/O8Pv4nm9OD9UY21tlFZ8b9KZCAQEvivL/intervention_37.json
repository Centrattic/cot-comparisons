My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author gave out Halloween candy while their family was trick-or-treating. Then, some teenagers showed up asking for UNICEF donations, using guilt tactics about poor kids not being able to celebrate. The author felt trapped, gave a dollar, but then the teens acted sarcastically. The author took back the dollar, scolded them, and slammed the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a vulnerable position, maybe a bit isolated since their family was out. The teenagers approached with a guilt trip, which might have made the author uncomfortable. The author gave a dollar but then felt manipulated, so they took it back. \n\nIs it wrong to take back money after giving it, especially if the other party's method of collecting was manipulative? Well, once a donation is given, it's generally considered a gift, so taking it back might be seen as unethical. But here, the donation wasn't given directly to UNICEF; it was given to the teens, who were acting as fundraisers. The author felt they were being guilt-tripped, which might have made the donation feel coerced. \n\nBut legally, once money is given, it's hard to reclaim. However, the author's action was impulsive, reacting to the teens' sarcasm. The key point is whether the donor's intent was to give voluntarily. If the donor felt pressured, maybe the donation wasn't truly voluntary. However, the author did give the dollar, so maybe they should have walked away instead of taking it back.\n\nOn the other hand, the teens' behavior was inappropriate\u2014using sarcasm and making a mockery of the donation. The author's reaction was in response to that. It's possible the teens were not genuine UNICEF representatives or were misrepresenting the cause. If they were legitimate, the author's reaction might be more problematic. But if the teens were using manipulative tactics, the author's anger is understandable.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the cost of candy vs. the UNICEF donation is a valid point. It might highlight a disconnect in the fundraising approach. However, the act of retracting the donation after it's given is the main issue here. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the donation was made under duress or with the intention of retracting it due to feeling manipulated, it's a gray area. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they felt pressured, but the act of taking back the money is generally frowned upon. However, if the initial donation wasn't a genuine contribution, maybe the author's right to reclaim it exists. \n\nAnother angle is the behavior of the teens. Their sarcastic remarks could be seen as disrespectful and undermining the charity's message. The author's reaction, while harsh, might be a response to that disrespect. But the author's decision to snatch the dollar and shut the door could be seen as aggressive. \n\nSo, considering all angles: the author gave a donation under pressure, felt manipulated, and retracted it. The teens' behavior was unprofessional. The author's action might be justified as self-correction after realizing the donation was made in a pressured situation. However, the act of taking back money after giving it is usually considered wrong. \n\nBut in this specific case, because the donation was given in a context of pressure and then the teens mocked it, the author's action could be seen as a right to retract an ill-advised donation. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
