My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking back a UNICEF donation. The situation is during Halloween when the author gave out candy. Teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, made a sarcastic comment about the dollar, and the author took back the money. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author gave a dollar initially, then took it back after the teens' sarcastic remark. The key points here are consent and the manner of the collection. UNICEF volunteers are supposed to collect donations, but if they're using guilt-tripping or aggressive tactics, that's an issue. The author felt trapped and then reacted strongly, which might be a bit over the top, but maybe justified if they felt disrespected.\n\nThe UNICEF program is a school project, and the kids are supposed to collect donations. However, the way they did it here was sarcastic and manipulative. The author's response was to snatch the dollar back and shut the door. That's a confrontational action, but if the initial donation wasn't given freely, maybe the author is within their rights to take it back. Also, the author points out that UNICEF is asking for donations in a way that's misleading, since Halloween isn't a thing in third-world countries. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a reaction to perceived manipulation. The question is whether taking back a donation is wrong. Legally, once a donation is given, it belongs to the recipient. But if the donation was given under false pretenses or coercion, the donor might have a case. However, the author gave the dollar, then took it back immediately. That might be seen as retracting a donation, which isn't typical. But considering the context, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe author's guilt after the fact shows they care about their actions. The other side is that UNICEF is a legitimate charity, and the kids might be just doing their project. But the way they collected the donation was problematic. The sarcastic comment could be seen as mocking the donor, which isn't appropriate. \n\nIn the end, the author's action was a response to feeling coerced and disrespected. While shutting the door might be harsh, the core issue is the manner of the collection. Since the author didn't know the UNICEF team's behavior beforehand, their reaction is a personal choice. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the problem was the other party's approach. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
