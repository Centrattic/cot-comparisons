My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves a Halloween scenario where the author had offered to hand out candy while their family was out trick-or-treating. When some teenagers showed up with a UNICEF donation request, the author gave them a dollar but then took it back because they felt the request was manipulative and sarcastic.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The author donated a dollar to UNICEF, but then took it back. The reason given was that the teenagers were using guilt-tripping tactics and being sarcastic. The author felt taken advantage of, even though they later had a moment of doubt.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. So, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the context. The teenagers were collecting for UNICEF, which is a legitimate charity. However, their approach was questionable\u2014using a guilt trip and sarcasm. The author had the right to refuse the donation, but they gave it first and then took it back. Was that acceptable?\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if someone donates to a charity, they can generally decide where they want their money to go. If they're not comfortable with the method used to solicit the donation, they have the right to retract it. However, there's also the aspect of respect. The author snatched the dollar back and shut the door. Was that rude? Maybe, but if they felt manipulated, their reaction could be seen as justified.\n\nAnother angle: charities often use emotional appeals, but crossing into sarcasm or mockery is problematic. The teenagers' behavior might have been inappropriate, which could have influenced the author's decision. Also, the author's initial donation was small, and the context was Halloween, which is more about fun than serious fundraising. The charity's approach might have been out of place.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong because they can change their mind about a donation. Morally, it's a bit more complex. If the teenagers were acting in bad faith, the author's reaction is understandable. However, the act of taking back the donation and being confrontational might come off as harsh. But if the author felt they were being tricked into giving, retracting the donation is their right.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to withdraw their donation if they felt uncomfortable with the methods used. The teenagers' approach was arguably inappropriate, and the author's response, while maybe abrupt, was a reaction to feeling manipulated. The key here is the manipulation and the right to retract a donation when the context changes.\n"
