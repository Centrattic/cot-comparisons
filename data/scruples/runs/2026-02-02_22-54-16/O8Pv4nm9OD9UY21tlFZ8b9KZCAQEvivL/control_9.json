My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person offered to stay home and give out Halloween candy while their parents went out. The neighborhood is upper-middle-class, so they're used to families from other areas coming for better candy. They usually have a bowl of candy for trick-or-treaters. Then, some older kids showed up asking for a donation for UNICEF, saying it's for kids in poor countries. The writer felt trapped, gave a dollar, but then the teens mocked them by saying the dollar could feed a village in a sarcastic tone. The writer took back the dollar, criticized their approach, and shut the door.\n\nThe key points here are the initial donation and then taking it back. The writer gave the dollar out of what they felt was a pressured situation, but then felt the teens were being sarcastic and took back the money. The question is whether the writer was wrong to do that.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. UNICEF is a legitimate charity, and the trick-or-treaters might be collecting funds for them. However, the way they presented the donation request was manipulative and sarcastic. The writer felt guilt-tripped and then had a negative reaction. \n\nIs it wrong to take back a donation if it was given under duress? If someone feels pressured into giving, they can withdraw their donation. The writer's initial action was giving money they didn't have much of, but then the teens' sarcastic remark might have been a provocation. The writer's response was confrontational, which could be seen as rude, but the context of feeling manipulated might justify it.\n\nAlso, the writer mentioned that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, which is a valid point. The trick-or-treaters were using a guilt-trip tactic, which is questionable. The writer's reaction, while abrupt, could be a response to that. \n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? It depends on whether their actions were justified. Since they felt pressured and the teens were mocking, taking back the money might be understandable. However, the way they reacted\u2014snatching the dollar and yelling\u2014could be seen as unkind. But the initial donation was under duress, which might make retracting it acceptable. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the writer had the right to take back the donation if they felt it was given under false pretenses or pressure. The teens' sarcastic approach was inappropriate, and the writer's response, while harsh, was a reaction to that manipulation.\n"
