My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: On Halloween, the author stayed home to hand out candy. When some older kids showed up with a UNICEF donation request, the author gave them a dollar. The teens then sarcastically exaggerated the impact of the dollar, which annoyed the author. The author snatched the dollar back and shut the door, feeling conflicted afterward.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's actions and the context. The author initially donated a dollar, which is their choice. However, after the teens' sarcastic remark, the author took back the money. \n\nIs it wrong to take back a donation? Donations are typically voluntary and given with the donor's intent. If the donor changes their mind, they have the right to take it back. The teens might have felt disrespected, but the author was reacting to what they perceived as manipulation or guilt-tripping. The author's reaction was impulsive, but they were within their rights to retract the donation. \n\nHowever, there's a social expectation that once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction. Taking it back could be seen as rude. But considering the situation\u2014the teens' sarcastic comment made the author feel trapped\u2014it's understandable. The author's intent wasn't to donate but was pressured into it, then regretted it immediately. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the cost of candy versus the UNICEF donation might be a valid point about the context of the donation. The author felt the teens were misrepresenting the cause, which could justify the reaction. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for taking back the money, as they had the right to retract their donation. The wrong might lie in the manner\u2014being abrupt and shutting the door\u2014but the action itself isn't illegal or unethical. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
