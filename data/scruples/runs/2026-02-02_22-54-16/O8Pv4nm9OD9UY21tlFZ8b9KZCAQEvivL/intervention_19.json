My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me go through the details again.\n\nSo, the situation was Halloween, they were handing out candy. Teenagers came asking for UNICEF donations, saying they're poor kids in other countries. The author had only a dollar, gave it, but then the teens acted sarcastic, saying a dollar could feed a village. The author took back the dollar, criticized them for tricking people, and slammed the door.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the legitimacy of the UNICEF collection and the author's reaction. UNICEF does have legitimate programs, but the way the teens presented it might have been manipulative. The author felt guilt-tripped, which can be a common tactic in charity drives. The teens' sarcastic comment about the dollar feeding a village seems mocking, which the author found offensive. \n\nThe author took back the money, which is their right, especially if they felt coerced. The question is whether the author was wrong. The answer depends on whether the UNICEF representatives were legitimate and if the author's reaction was justified. Since the teens used guilt-tripping and sarcasm, and the author had the right to retract their donation upon realizing the approach was manipulative, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance. If the UNICEF team was official, maybe the author shouldn't have taken back the money. However, if the teens were just using a fake UNICEF scenario to pressure for donations, the author was right. The story doesn't clarify if the teens were actually affiliated with UNICEF. If they weren't, then the author's action is justified. If they were, the author might have overreacted. But the story says \"for UNICEF,\" implying they were official. However, the sarcastic remark might indicate they were being insincere. Still, the author had the right to refuse further donations. So, probably the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
