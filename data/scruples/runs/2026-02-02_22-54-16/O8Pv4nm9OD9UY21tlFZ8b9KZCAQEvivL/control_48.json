My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, during Halloween, the author stayed home to give out candy while their family went trick-or-treating. They usually have a bowl of candy for kids. Then, some teenagers come asking for donations for UNICEF, saying they're helping poor kids in other countries. The author gives a dollar but then takes it back when the teens are sarcastic about it. The author feels guilty but thinks UNICEF is taking advantage by guilt-tripping people. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author gave a donation, then took it back. Is that acceptable? Well, when someone donates, it's generally considered a gift, so taking it back might be seen as unethical. However, the context here is important. The author was pressured into donating, and the teens were being sarcastic. The author felt trapped and then had a change of heart. \n\nOn one hand, once you give a donation, even if you're pressured, it's usually not expected to take it back. So the author might be in the wrong for retracting the gift. On the other hand, the situation involved manipulation and sarcasm, which could make the author feel coerced. The author's intent was to give candy, not donate to UNICEF, and the way the teens approached them might have been inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning was that the donation wasn't appropriate for the context\u2014Halloween isn't celebrated in third-world countries as described. So maybe they felt the request was exploiting the situation. However, UNICEF is a legitimate charity, and even if the approach was questionable, taking back the money could be seen as dishonest. \n\nI think the key point here is whether the author had the right to take back the donation. If they gave it voluntarily, even under pressure, once given, it's theirs to keep. Retracting it might be seen as impolite or dishonest. But the pressure and the sarcastic comment might have influenced the author's initial donation, making it less voluntary. \n\nAnother angle is the ethical responsibility of the teens. If they were being manipulative, the fault isn't entirely on the author. Still, the author's action of taking back the money could be seen as rude or unfair. \n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is a bit ambiguous, the act of taking back a donation after giving it is generally frowned upon. So the author might be in the wrong. But there's some nuance because of the pressure and the teens' behavior. However, the standard expectation is that once you give, you don't take back. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
