My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation is about a Halloween event where the author gave out candy while their family was out. They encountered some teenagers collecting for UNICEF, and the interaction turned heated when the teens made a sarcastic comment about the dollar donation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they offered to stay and give out candy, which is a common Halloween practice. The teenagers came for UNICEF, which usually collects donations during Halloween. However, the teens' behavior was questionable\u2014they used guilt-tripping and sarcastic remarks. The author felt trapped and then took back the dollar, which led to shutting the door.\n\nNow, legal perspective: Donations are usually voluntary. Once given, they typically become the recipient's property. But there might be exceptions if there was fraud or misrepresentation. However, in this case, the author gave a dollar, then took it back. Legally, if the donation hasn't been spent yet, can the donor reclaim it? That's a bit tricky. If the donation was made under a mistake or under duress, maybe. But usually, once given, it's done.\n\nEthically, the question is whether the author acted inappropriately. The author felt manipulated by the teens' tone and the guilt-trip tactics. They decided to retract the donation, which could be seen as a reaction to what they perceived as exploitation. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it might be considered rude or inconsiderate, especially if the teens were genuinely collecting for a cause.\n\nBut, the key point here is the context of the interaction. The teens' sarcastic behavior might have justified the author's reaction. If the teens were using a fake UNICEF program to scam people, the author had the right to withdraw the donation. However, if the teens were legitimate, the author might have overreacted. The problem is that the author didn't check if the teens were authentic UNICEF representatives. Legitimate fundraising organizations usually have official attire and materials.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not verifying the legitimacy of the donation request first. If the teens were indeed with UNICEF, the author's response was inappropriate. But if they were fraudsters, the author did the right thing. Since the scenario doesn't confirm whether the teens were genuine, it's ambiguous. However, the author's immediate assumption that it was a scam based on the teens' demeanor might not be fair. But their reaction was to protect themselves from being taken advantage of.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they felt pressured and reacted. However, taking back the donation after giving it might still be seen as rude, regardless of their reasoning. The teens' tone and the situation's context could have influenced the author's decision. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author had the right to withdraw the donation due to the uncomfortable and manipulative situation, even if it's unkind. But there's a gray area here. The alternative is that the author could have refused the donation initially or asked for verification instead of taking it back. Still, the answer is B.\n"
