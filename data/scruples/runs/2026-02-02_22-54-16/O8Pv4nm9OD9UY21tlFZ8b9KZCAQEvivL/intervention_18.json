My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me go through the scenario again.\n\nSo, the author was at home handing out Halloween candy. Some teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, saying it's for poor kids in other countries. The author gave a dollar, but then the teens acted sarcastic, saying the dollar could feed a village. The author snatched the dollar back, said some harsh things, and shut the door. Now they're wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Halloween is a time when people are typically generous. The author was in a good mood, giving out candy. Then these teens showed up, maybe older than usual trick-or-treaters. The author felt pressured and used guilt tactics. The key point here is the reaction of the teens\u2014mocking the donation. That might have triggered the author's frustration.\n\nThe author gave a dollar but then took it back. The question is whether that's justified. On one hand, the author might feel tricked by the teens' sarcastic comment. On the other hand, taking back the money and being confrontational could be seen as rude.\n\nBut wait, the author's main issue is with how the donation was solicited. They felt it was manipulative to guilt people into donating. The sarcastic remark might have been a provocation. The author's response was immediate and defensive, which is understandable in the heat of the moment.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling like an asshole afterward. That's a sign of remorse. The act of taking back the money was impulsive, but maybe they felt they were protecting their own generosity. However, the confrontation might have been unnecessary. If they wanted to retract the donation, perhaps they could have done so calmly without the harsh words.\n\nBut in terms of the act itself\u2014taking back the money\u2014UNICEF's representatives (assuming they were official) might not have accepted the money if they knew it would be taken back, but the author had the right to change their mind. The problem might be the manner in which they did it, not the act itself.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider intent and the context, the author felt wronged and acted on impulse. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the pressure and the teens' behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for taking back the donation, but their response could have been more measured. Since the options are A for yes and B for no, the answer is B.\n"
