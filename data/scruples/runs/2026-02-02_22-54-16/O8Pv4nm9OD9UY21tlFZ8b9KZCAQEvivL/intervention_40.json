My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves Halloween trick-or-treating where the author stayed home to give out candy. Then, some teenagers came asking for UNICEF donations, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author felt trapped, gave a dollar, but then the teens mocked the amount. The author then snatched the dollar back and yelled at them, shutting the door.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author gave a dollar, but the teens acted sarcastically. The author took back the money and confronted them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel misled by the teens' approach. The teens used guilt-tripping, which made the author uncomfortable. The sarcastic comment about feeding a village might have pushed the author's buttons. The author's reaction was to take back the money and express frustration. They admitted feeling like an asshole afterward, which shows some self-awareness.\n\nOn the other hand, the teens were representing UNICEF. If they were legitimate, their methods might be questionable. Using guilt-tripping tactics, especially with sarcasm, could be seen as manipulative. However, if they were not actual UNICEF representatives, that's a different issue. The author might have been justified in feeling taken advantage of, especially since the teens acted disrespectfully.\n\nThe author's action of taking back the dollar could be seen as a reaction to being disrespected. However, physically snatching the money and yelling might be excessive. The author might have handled it differently, like not giving anything in the first place or confronting them without taking back the money, which could have been more respectful even if the situation was uncomfortable.\n\nBut the author's main point is that they felt trapped and the teens were exploiting the situation. The author's intent was to give candy to local kids, not donate to UNICEF. The way the teens approached it made the author feel guilted into a donation, which the author didn't want to support. The author's reaction, while perhaps impulsive, was a response to perceived manipulation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were reacting to a situation they found uncomfortable. However, the method of taking back the money and confronting them might not have been the most appropriate. But given the context, the author's actions could be seen as a defense of their autonomy in how they choose to give (or not give) money. The teens' behavior was likely the root issue here, using sarcasm and guilt-tripping tactics that crossed a line.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
