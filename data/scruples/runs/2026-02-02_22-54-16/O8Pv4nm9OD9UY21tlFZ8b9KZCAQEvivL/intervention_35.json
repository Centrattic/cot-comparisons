My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation involves Halloween trick-or-treating where the author gave out candy while their family was out. Then, some teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author gave a dollar but then took it back when the teens were sarcastic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they felt pressured. The teenagers used a manipulative approach, which made the author uncomfortable. The author's reaction was to snatch the dollar back and shut the door. \n\nI should think about the principles here. Donations are usually voluntary. If someone feels coerced or manipulated into giving, they have the right to retract their donation. The UNICEF representatives here used guilt-tripping, which is a form of pressure that can make people feel they have to contribute, even if they don't want to. The author's decision to take back the money could be seen as a reaction to that manipulation.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned feeling like an asshole afterward but stood by their decision. The key points are the feeling of being trapped and the sarcastic response from the teens. The author might have felt that the donation wasn't being used as intended, especially since they pointed out that the kids in poor countries don't celebrate Halloween. That could add to the feeling of being taken advantage of.\n\nAnother angle is the immediacy of the situation. The author didn't have time to think it through, and the interaction was on the spot. People can change their minds about donations if they feel the context was misleading. The author's action, though abrupt, might be a way to assert their autonomy in a situation that felt manipulative.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once a donation is given, retracting it could be seen as rude or inconsiderate. But given the circumstances\u2014pressure, sarcasm, and the author's discomfort\u2014it's understandable. The author isn't wrong for taking back the money if they felt the donation wasn't appropriate under the circumstances. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted based on feeling manipulated and didn't want to support what they saw as a guilt-trip tactic. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
