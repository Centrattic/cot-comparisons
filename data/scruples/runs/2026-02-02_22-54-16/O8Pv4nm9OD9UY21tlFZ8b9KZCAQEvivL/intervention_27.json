My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation is a bit nuanced, so I need to consider different angles.\n\nFirst, the context: On Halloween, the author stayed home to hand out candy while their family went trick-or-treating. They usually provide a bowl of candy for kids to grab, which is a common practice. Then, some teenagers showed up for UNICEF, not candy. The author gave a dollar out of their wallet, but the teenagers responded sarcastically, implying the dollar could feed a village. The author then snatched the dollar back, said some harsh words, and shut the door.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the teenagers' actions. The author didn't know they were supposed to be collecting for UNICEF, so they gave a dollar they had in their wallet. The teenagers' sarcastic remark about the dollar's impact might have made the author feel manipulated. The author then took back the money, which could be seen as a reaction to being guilt-tripped.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Donation is a voluntary act. If the author felt pressured and then decided they didn't want to give, they have the right to retract the donation. But there's the method: snatching the money back and shutting the door. Was the initial donation made under duress? The teenagers approached as \"trick or treat for UNICEF,\" which is a specific request. The author might have thought they were supposed to donate, but when the teenagers acted inappropriately, the author's frustration led to taking back the money. \n\nHowever, once the donation is given, even if made in haste, taking it back might not be the best approach. Maybe the author could have addressed the issue without confrontation. But the teenagers' behavior was unprofessional and sarcastic, which could justify the author's reaction. \n\nSome might argue that the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation calmly and for being rude. Others might say the teenagers overstepped, and the author was within their rights to retract the donation. \n\nLegally, if the money was given as a donation, it's a completed transaction, so the author can't take it back. But ethically, if they felt misled, maybe they can. However, the teenagers might have been following a legitimate UNICEF program where kids collect donations door-to-door. The author's anger at being guilt-tripped could be a personal issue, but the reaction of snatching the money might be seen as rude. \n\nIn the end, it's about whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. The teenagers' sarcasm likely crossed a line, making the author feel tricked. The author's right to retract the donation is questionable, but their emotional response might be understandable. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a chance of A if the author's reaction is seen as excessive.\n"
