My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation is during Halloween, where they gave out candy while their family was trick-or-treating. Then, some teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar but then took it back, got angry, and slammed the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if someone donates money, can they take it back? Probably not, once the exchange is done. But in this case, the donation was given but then snatched back. The author might have given it under pressure, but once the dollar was handed over, taking it back might not be acceptable. \n\nEthically, the question is whether the author had the right to retract their donation. If they felt coerced, maybe there's a case. But the teenagers were acting on behalf of UNICEF, or maybe just themselves. The author's reaction was strong\u2014snatching the dollar and being confrontational. That part is questionable. Even if they felt pressured, taking back the money and being rude could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the initial donation was made under what the author perceives as manipulation, which complicates it.\n\nThe teenagers' behavior was sarcastic and maybe exaggerated, which could be seen as manipulative. If they were using guilt-tripping tactics, that's an issue. But the author's response was to take the money back and shut the door. The key points are whether the donation was voluntary and if the author's reaction was justified.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the donation was made with the intention to give, even under pressure, retracting it might not be the right thing. However, if the pressure made the donation involuntary, maybe there's an argument. But in practice, once given, it's hard to take back. The author's anger and confrontation might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions in taking back the money and being rude might make them in the wrong, but if the donation was given under undue influence, maybe there's a defense. However, the immediate reaction of taking back the money and being confrontational is problematic. So, probably the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe it's B if the pressure is considered valid. Hmm.\n"
