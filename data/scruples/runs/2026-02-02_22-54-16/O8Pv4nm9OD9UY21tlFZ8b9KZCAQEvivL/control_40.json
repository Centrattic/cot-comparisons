My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The scenario involves Halloween trick-or-treating where the person was collecting candy for families. Then, some teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The person gave a dollar but then took it back because they felt manipulated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was in a situation where they were expecting to give out candy, not donate money. The UNICEF collection here seems to be part of a school or community program, where kids go door-to-door to solicit donations. The collectors used a sarcastic comment about a dollar feeding a village, which probably made the person feel they were being mocked. That reaction led the person to snatch back the dollar.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the person have an obligation to donate? No. They were not forced. The UNICEF collectors used a tactic that might be seen as manipulative or sarcastic, which could provoke a defensive reaction. The person took back the money because they felt guilt-tripped. The question is whether this action makes them wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, donating is voluntary. If someone changes their mind after making a donation, can they take it back? Legally, if the donation hasn't been transferred yet, they can. Ethically, it's a gray area. The person felt disrespected by the collectors' approach, which might justify their reaction. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as rude, but not necessarily wrong. The person's right to change their mind is there. The collectors' approach was questionable, using sarcasm to pressure someone into giving more than they were comfortable with.\n\nUNICEF's door-to-door collections are usually done by students, which might not be the most effective method. The sarcastic comment about a dollar feeding a village is a common criticism of such campaigns, as it's seen as exaggerating the impact of small donations. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they were in a different context (Halloween candy) and not expecting to be asked for a donation.\n\nThe person did give the dollar initially, but changed their mind due to the collectors' approach. Taking back the money is a personal choice, and while the method (snatching it back and slamming the door) was harsh, the act itself might be justified given the manipulation they felt. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since donations are voluntary and the collectors used pressure tactics, the author's reaction is a response to that pressure, which could mean they're not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The person had the right to change their mind, especially after feeling manipulated. The collectors' tactics were problematic, and the author's reaction is a valid response to that.\n"
