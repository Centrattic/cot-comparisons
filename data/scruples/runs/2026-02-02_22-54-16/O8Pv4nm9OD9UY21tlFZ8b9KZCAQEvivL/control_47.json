My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by taking back their UNICEF donation. So the situation is during Halloween, the author stayed home to give out candy. Then some teenagers came trick-or-treating for UNICEF, and they made a sarcastic comment about the dollar the author gave. The author snatched the dollar back, told them off, and shut the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a position where they offered to stay and give out candy. The usual practice is to have a bowl of candy for kids. The UNICEF trick-or-treaters came, asked for donations, and the sarcastic remark from them probably made the author feel manipulated.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the nature of the donation. The author gave the dollar, but it seems like they were pressured by the UNICEF teens. The teens might have used guilt-tripping, which the author found offensive. Taking back the donation could be seen as a reaction to being coerced. However, once a donation is given, is it appropriate to take it back?\n\nBut wait, the author didn't give the dollar to UNICEF; they were asked for a donation, gave the dollar, and then took it back. So technically, the donation was made voluntarily, but under pressure. However, once the dollar was given, the author took it back, which might be seen as impolite or even illegal if it's considered a completed transaction. But since it's a small amount and in person, maybe it's not illegal, but ethically?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they felt manipulated and that the teens were using guilt-tripping. They also mentioned that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, so the context of the donation was misleading. The question is whether the author has a right to retract the donation once given.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, people often consider intent and the situation's nuances. The author might be in the right if they felt coerced. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as rude. But given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. The UNICEF collectors might have overstepped by being sarcastic and using guilt. The author's reaction, while strong, might be justified if they felt they were being taken advantage of.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have refused the donation politely without taking it back. But in the heat of the moment, their reaction was to snatch it. So maybe there's a better way to handle it, but the core issue is whether the donation was given under false pretenses or pressure. The author's right to retract it might depend on local laws, but ethically, if the donation was made under pressure, retracting it could be acceptable.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author felt manipulated and the UNICEF teens might have acted inappropriately. The author's actions were a reaction to being guilt-tripped, and taking back the donation could be seen as reclaiming their choice once they realized the pressure.\n"
