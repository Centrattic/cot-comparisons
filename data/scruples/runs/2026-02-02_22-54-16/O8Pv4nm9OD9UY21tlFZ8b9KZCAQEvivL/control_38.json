My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, the context: On Halloween, the person stayed home to hand out candy. Teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The person felt pressured, gave a dollar, then took it back when they realized the teens were being sarcastic and manipulative.\n\nThe key points here are the initial donation and the subsequent retraction. The person gave a dollar out of a sense of obligation, which they later felt was coerced. Then, when they saw the sarcasm and realized the teens were exploiting the situation, they took their money back.\n\nLegally, once money is given as a donation, it's typically considered a gift. However, if the donation was made under duress or mistake, there might be grounds to reclaim it. But in this case, the duress was self-imposed because they chose to give in the moment.\n\nEthically, the situation is more nuanced. The person felt tricked by the teens' sarcastic remarks, which made them realize the donation wasn't being used as intended. The guilt-tripping and the teens' behavior (mocking the donation amount) could be seen as manipulative. The person's response\u2014snatching the money back\u2014might seem confrontational, but they were reacting to what they perceived as exploitation.\n\nAnother angle is intent. The person's original intention was to support UNICEF, but the teens' approach made them question the legitimacy of the request. By taking back the money, they were asserting their right to decide how and when to donate, especially after realizing the teens might not be acting in good faith.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once a donation is made, retracting it isn't appropriate, even if the initial donation was under pressure. The person could have refused to give in the first place instead of taking it back later. Their reaction, while understandable, might be seen as impulsive and potentially embarrassing for the teens, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the person's actions were a reaction to feeling manipulated. They took back the money to correct a donation they felt was made under false pretenses. While their approach was direct, the underlying issue is about the ethical use of guilt-tripping tactics. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
