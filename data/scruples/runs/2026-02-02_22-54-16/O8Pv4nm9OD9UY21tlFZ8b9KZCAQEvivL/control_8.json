My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back a dollar they donated to UNICEF through trick-or-treaters. The situation involved high schoolers asking for donations, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author felt trapped, gave a dollar, then took it back because they felt the approach was manipulative.\n\nFirst, the legality: There's no law against taking back a donation immediately after making it. Once the money is given, it's technically a gift, but if the transaction isn't completed (like the teens didn't deliver a token or receipt), the donor can revoke it. So legally, the author might not be wrong.\n\nEthically, it's trickier. The author felt pressured, which can be a common issue with aggressive fundraising. The teens' sarcastic remark might have crossed a line, making the author feel disrespected. The author's reaction was defensive, which is understandable if they felt manipulated.\n\nUNICEF's role: They use various fundraising methods, including door-to-door by students. If the program encourages guilt-tripping, that's problematic. But the author's issue was with the teens' behavior, not the organization itself. The author might have overreacted by snatching the money back, but their frustration is valid if they felt harassed.\n\nPublic opinion in AITA threads often considers intent. The author gave the dollar but felt the approach was unethical. Taking it back was impulsive but a reaction to feeling ambushed. Whether they're in the wrong depends on viewing the situation as a legitimate mistake versus a justified reaction to manipulation.\n\nMost people might side with the author, considering the context of feeling pressured and the teens' sarcastic behavior. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
