My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a Halloween scenario where the author gave out candy while their family was trick-or-treating. Then, some teenagers showed up asking for UNICEF donations, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back because they felt manipulated. They shut the door on the teens, feeling conflicted afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author was in a neighborhood where families give out high-quality candy, and they were welcoming to trick-or-treaters. The teenagers came during Halloween, which is a time when kids usually collect candy. However, these teens were collecting for UNICEF, using the premise that donations can help poor kids in other countries who can't celebrate Halloween. The author felt that the teens were exploiting the situation by guilt-tripping people, which led to their reaction.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author felt pressured and manipulated into donating. 2) They took back the dollar because they felt it wasn't a genuine donation. 3) The author's comment about the cost of candy vs. the donation and the third-world kids not celebrating Halloween.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author was not obligated to donate. When someone asks for money, even with a cause, the person being asked is free to donate or not. However, the way the teens presented the donation might be questionable. Using guilt-tripping (\"poor kids who can't come trick or treat\") could be seen as manipulative. The author's response was to take back the money because they felt it was a setup, not a genuine request.\n\nIs taking back the money wrong? Well, if the author hadn't had a change of heart and just gave the dollar as a donation, that would be acceptable. But after giving it and then taking it back, maybe that's rude. However, the author felt they were being tricked, which might justify their action. Also, the teens' sarcastic comment might have provoked the author's reaction. The author's comment about the cost of candy versus the donation might seem dismissive, but they were reacting to what they perceived as exploitation.\n\nAnother angle: Is it wrong to take back money after giving it? If someone gives a donation and then immediately takes it back, that could be seen as disrespectful. However, if the donation was made under false pretenses or manipulation, the person might have a right to reclaim it. The author's justification was that the teens were using Halloween to guilt-trip people, which the author found unethical.\n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone feels manipulated, they have the right to retract their donation. However, doing so in a confrontational manner (snatching the dollar back and slamming the door) could be seen as impolite. The author's tone and actions might be seen as overreacting, but the initial provocation from the teens might have caused that.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author was not obligated to donate, and if they felt manipulated, retracting the donation could be justified. However, the way they did it might be considered rude. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether retracting the donation is acceptable given the circumstances.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they acted based on feeling manipulated. However, their method of retracting the donation was abrupt. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and not about politeness, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
