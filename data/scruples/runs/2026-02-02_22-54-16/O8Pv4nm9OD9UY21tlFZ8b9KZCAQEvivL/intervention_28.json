My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The story is about a Halloween situation where they gave a dollar to some teens who were collecting for UNICEF. The teens were being sarcastic, and the person took back the dollar, got angry, and shut the door. They're asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author had a right to feel pressured or tricked into donating, especially since the teens used guilt-tripping tactics. The sarcastic comment about feeding a village with a dollar might have been part of that pressure. The author then reclaimed their money, which could be seen as a reaction to being manipulated.\n\nOn the other hand, the teens were collecting for UNICEF, which is a legitimate charity. However, the way they approached the author might have been inappropriate. Using sarcasm and making exaggerated claims could be seen as manipulative, which the author reasonably called out.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the donation and the method used by the teens. The author wasn't obligated to donate, especially if they felt coerced. Reacting strongly to what they perceived as manipulation is understandable. But taking back the money after giving it might be seen as rude, even if the initial donation was under duress.\n\nHowever, the author's actions were a response to what they felt was a trick. They corrected the teens' false statements about the dollar's impact and left. The question is whether the author's behavior was justified given the situation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a matter of perspective. The author had the right to refuse or retract a donation if they felt pressured. The teens' approach was arguably unethical, which the author pointed out. So while the act of taking back the money might be seen as impolite, the underlying issue is the misuse of guilt tactics by the collectors. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for reacting as they did.\n"
