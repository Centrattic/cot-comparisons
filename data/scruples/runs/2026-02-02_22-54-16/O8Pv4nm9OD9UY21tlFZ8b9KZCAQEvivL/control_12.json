My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation was in the wrong. The situation is that during Halloween, the author gave out candy but was approached by teenagers collecting for UNICEF. The kids used guilt-tripping tactics, which made the author uncomfortable, so they took back the dollar they gave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they felt pressured. The teenagers made a sarcastic comment implying that a dollar could feed a village, which the author found manipulative. The author then snatched the dollar back and left. \n\nNow, the key points here are about the right to withdraw a donation and the appropriateness of the response. Donations are typically voluntary and can be retracted, especially if the donor feels coerced. The author's reaction was emotional, but they might have felt that the UNICEF representatives were using guilt tactics, which is a common criticism of some fundraising methods. \n\nHowever, the author's manner of taking back the money was confrontational. They snatched the dollar and shut the door. While they might have had the right to retract their donation, the way they did it could be seen as rude or aggressive. The question is whether the action itself (retracting the donation) is wrong, or just the method of doing so.\n\nAnother angle is the validity of the UNICEF cause. The author's argument is that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, so the fundraising method is misplaced. But UNICEF's mission does include helping children globally, regardless of local traditions. However, the way the teens presented it was sarcastic, which the author found offensive.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the act of taking back a donation isn't inherently wrong, especially if the donor feels pressured. However, the author's public confrontation might have been inappropriate. The question is whether the author was justified in their actions given the context of feeling manipulated.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong for retracting the donation, as they had the right to do so, but their reaction's tone could be seen as uncivil. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong in general, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the donation can be withdrawn, even if the method was harsh.\n"
