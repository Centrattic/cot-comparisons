My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation is during Halloween when they gave out candy while their family was out. Teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt by saying it's for poor kids. The author gave them a dollar, but then the teens acted sarcastic, so the author took the dollar back and shut the door. They're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they felt pressured by the teens. The key points here are the manipulation by the UNICEF representatives (using guilt, sarcasm) and the immediate reaction of the author. \n\nThe author didn't know they were dealing with teens, not actual UNICEF workers. The teens' behavior was condescending, which might have triggered the author's reaction. The author's response was impulsive: taking the dollar back and being confrontational. But was this the right move?\n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to refuse donation after seeing the manipulation. On the other hand, taking the money back was confrontational. However, the author did give the dollar initially but then took it back because they felt tricked. The guilt-tripping might have crossed a line, making the author's reaction understandable. \n\nAlso, considering UNICEF's usual approach, if the teens were impersonating them, that's a separate issue. But if they were actual representatives, their method might be questionable. The author's frustration with being guilt-tripped for a cause they don't support (since third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween) adds to their justification.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to feeling manipulated. While taking back the dollar was impulsive, it's not necessarily wrong given the circumstances. The main issue is the ethical approach of using guilt to collect donations. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
