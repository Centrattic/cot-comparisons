My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was trick-or-treating and offered to stay home to hand out candy. When a group of teens came asking for donations for UNICEF, they felt pressured and gave a dollar. But then the teens mocked the amount, leading the author to snatch the dollar back and shut the door. The author is questioning if they were wrong for doing this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author felt trapped into a guilt trip, the teens' sarcastic comment, and the author's reaction. \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Donations are supposed to be voluntary. If someone feels pressured into giving, maybe their right to withdraw the donation exists. The author's reaction was emotional, but was it wrong? The teens might have overstepped by mocking the donation amount, which could be seen as rude or manipulative. The author's response was defensive, possibly out of frustration with the guilt-tripping. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking back the dollar. Legally, once a donation is given, it belongs to the recipient, but the author took it back mid-transaction. Ethically, if the donation was made under pressure and the author realized it, maybe they have the right to retract. However, in practice, taking back a given item could be seen as rude, especially in a public setting like trick-or-treating. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the cost of candy vs. the donation might be a valid point. They might feel that the way UNICEF was being presented was exploiting the situation. \n\nBut then again, the author did give the dollar initially, so taking it back could be seen as indecisive or confrontational. The sarcastic remark from the teens might have provoked the author's reaction. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author acted in the wrong by repossessing the dollar. Since the donation wasn't yet a completed transaction (the dollar was in their wallet and given to the teens, but then taken back), the author might have the right to change their mind. However, the manner in which they took it back was abrupt and confrontational. \n\nThe key here is intent. The author felt manipulated and decided to retract the donation. The teens' mocking may have been a factor. Ethically, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong because they felt coerced, but their reaction could be seen as rude. However, the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking back the donation. Considering the pressure and the sarcastic remark, the author's actions might be justified as self-defense against manipulation. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
