My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the person stayed home to give out candy on Halloween while their family went trick-or-treating. They had a bowl of candy for the kids. Then a couple of teenagers came, asked for donations for UNICEF, saying they were helping poor kids in other countries. The person had only a dollar in their wallet, gave it, but then the teens acted sarcastic, saying a dollar could feed a village. The person got annoyed, took back the dollar, and shut the door. Now they're wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Halloween is a time when people often collect donations for UNICEF, usually by asking trick-or-treaters for change. The author gave a dollar, which the teens mocked. The key points here are the author's reaction and the teens' behavior.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to be feeling manipulated or guilt-tripped into giving a donation. They felt uncomfortable with the teens' sarcastic comment about feeding a village with a dollar. Their response was to take back the money and shut the door. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, donating to charity is a voluntary act. If the donor feels that the way they're being asked is manipulative or deceptive, they have the right to withdraw their donation. However, the author's method of taking the money back might be seen as rude. The teens were there to collect donations, maybe as part of a school project or similar. The author could have declined politely instead of confronting them.\n\nOn the other hand, the teens might not have been genuine. Their sarcastic behavior could indicate they weren't actually collecting for UNICEF but were making a joke or prank. The author felt they were being taken advantage of, so their reaction, while perhaps abrupt, was based on that perception.\n\nAnother angle: the author had the right to change their mind about the donation. Once a donation is given, the donor can't take it back if the recipient is a registered charity. However, in this case, the author didn't know if the teens were legitimate UNICEF collectors. If they weren't, the donation wasn't going to the charity, so the author had more right to reclaim it.\n\nBut the way they did it\u2014grabbing the dollar and shutting the door\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author might not have been in the wrong for their feelings and reaction given the situation. The key is whether the author acted unethically or disrespectfully. Some might say they were justified in feeling manipulated, others might think they should have handled it more calmly.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they had the right to withdraw the donation if they felt it wasn't being used as intended. However, the method of taking it back was abrupt. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's action was to take back their money based on their perception, it's a bit of a gray area. But the main issue is the legitimacy of the donation request and the donor's right to reverse it.\n"
