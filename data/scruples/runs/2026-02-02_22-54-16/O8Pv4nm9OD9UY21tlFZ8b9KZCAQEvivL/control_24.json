My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, during Halloween, the author stayed home to hand out candy. A group of teenagers showed up, asked for donations for UNICEF, and made a sarcastic comment about the dollar being able to feed a village. The author then took back the dollar and shut the door. Now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author gave a dollar, then took it back. Was the donation voluntary? The teens used guilt-tripping by mentioning poor kids in other countries. The author felt pressured, which is why they took back the money. \n\nLegally, if someone gives a donation, can they take it back? Donations are usually considered gifts once given. But if the donation was under duress or coercion, maybe there's a different perspective. However, in reality, once the money is handed over, it's hard to retract unless there's fraud or some legal basis. \n\nEthically, the author might feel wronged because they felt manipulated. The teens' sarcastic remark could be seen as exploitative. However, the author's reaction was to snatch the money and yell. That's aggressive and could be seen as rude or confrontational. So even if the author felt pressured, their response might be inconsiderate.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the donation was given under pressure but then taken back, maybe they have a point about the manipulation. But their reaction might be seen as impolite. Some might argue that the author should have not given in the first place if they didn't feel comfortable, but others might say the teens were using guilt tactics. \n\nAlso, UNICEF is a legitimate charity, but the way the teens approached the author might have been inappropriate. However, the author's response was to confront them harshly. So maybe the fault isn't entirely on one side. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that donations are generally voluntary and once given, the author's action of taking back the money could be problematic. However, if the donation was made under duress, there's some argument for the author's side. The sarcasm from the teens could have made the author feel tricked. \n\nBut the main issue is whether taking back the money is wrong. Legally, once given, the money is the recipient's. So the author can't take it back. Ethically, if someone gives under pressure and then changes their mind, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe author's reaction was harsh, but maybe they were justifiably angry. However, the act of taking back the donation might be seen as inconsiderate towards the charity's cause, even if the method was poor. \n\nSo weighing both sides, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling pressured and wanting to retract the donation, especially if they felt misled. But their method of doing so was rude. However, the core question is about the rightness of taking back the donation, not their manner. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider intent and the circumstances. The author's intent was to not support what they saw as manipulative practices. The teens might have overstepped, but the author's action might still be seen as wrong because donations are typically final once given. \n\nBut maybe in this case, the author isn't in the wrong because they felt coerced. It's a tricky balance. I think the answer could lean either way, but given the context of the AITA subreddit, often the community tends to say the person isn't in the wrong if they felt misled. However, taking back the donation might still be seen as problematic. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Based on the analysis, if the author felt coerced and the donation was under pressure, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But their method of retracting it was impolite. However, the core question is about the act of taking back the donation. \n\nIn legal terms, once donated, the money is theirs. So the author can't take it back. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong). But ethically, if they were pressured, maybe B. \n\nBut the AITA subreddit often considers the context. The author felt tricked, and the response was strong, but the act of taking back the donation is what's in question. \n\nI think the answer here is B (not in the wrong) because the author felt manipulated, and the way the donation was collected was questionable. However, the method of retraction was rude, but the core action of retracting might be excusable given the circumstances. So B.\n"
