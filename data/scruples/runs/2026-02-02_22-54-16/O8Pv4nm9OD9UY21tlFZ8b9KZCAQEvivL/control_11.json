My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation is that during Halloween, the author was giving out candy and got approached by teenagers collecting for UNICEF. The author gave $1 but then took it back because the teens were being sarcastic and using guilt-trip tactics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Halloween is a time when people usually collect for charity, often kids going door to door. The author was alone, maybe felt pressured. The teens said something about the dollar feeding a village in a sarcastic way, which made the author snap. \n\nNow, the question is about right and wrong. The author gave the money initially but then took it back. Is that acceptable? Well, giving a donation is a voluntary act. If the author changed their mind later, maybe they can take it back. But was the way they did it appropriate? They snatched the dollar and shut the door. That's a bit confrontational. \n\nOn the other hand, the teens might have been using guilt-tripping tactics, which can be off-putting. The author might have felt manipulated. Also, the author points out that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, so it's a bit ironic. \n\nBut legally, once money is given, it's a donation. Taking it back might not be a legal issue but socially, is it right? The author had every right to decline the donation in the first place but after giving, taking it back could be seen as abrupt. However, the initial donation was under pressure, so the author might have felt justified in retracting it. \n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author's reaction was a result of feeling manipulated. While the method of taking back the money was harsh, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were responding to what they perceived as guilt-tripping. The key point is that the donation wasn't given freely if the person felt coerced. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
