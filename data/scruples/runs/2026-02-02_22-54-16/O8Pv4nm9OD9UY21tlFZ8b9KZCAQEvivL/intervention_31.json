My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation from both sides.\n\nFirst, the person gave out candy on Halloween while their family was away. They were approached by teenagers collecting for UNICEF. The teens used a guilt-tripping approach, saying the dollar could feed a village in a sarcastic way. The author felt trapped, took back the dollar, and shut the door. They're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, to determine if they're in the wrong, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main points are: the method of collection, the author's reaction, and the context of the situation.\n\nUNICEF is a legitimate charity, and their door-to-door collections during Halloween are common. However, the way the teens presented the donation might be questionable. Using guilt or implying a dollar can feed a village is a bit of an oversimplification and could be seen as manipulative. The author felt pressured and decided to take back the money, which might be a valid reaction to feeling manipulated.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did initially offer the dollar, even though they only had that. Taking it back after the fact could be seen as rude or dishonest, depending on the circumstances. However, the key here is the context of the interaction. The teens' sarcastic tone and the way they framed the donation might have crossed a line.\n\nThe author's actions were a response to feeling pressured and manipulated. They corrected the teens' misinformation about third-world countries not celebrating Halloween, which shows they were trying to point out the inappropriateness of the approach. The fact that they felt like an asshole afterward suggests they had mixed feelings, but they stood by their decision.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were reacting to what they perceived as a manipulative tactic. However, the act of taking the money back after giving it could be seen as impolite. But considering the context and the pressure applied by the collectors, the author's reaction is understandable. The guilt-tripping method used by the teens might be the more problematic aspect here.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, I think the author is not in the wrong because they were responding to a situation where they felt manipulated. The key is the method of the collection, which might have been the real issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
