My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author was at home on Halloween giving out candy. When their parents left for trick-or-treating, they stayed behind. Some teenagers showed up, asked for donations for UNICEF, used a guilt-tripping approach, and the author felt uncomfortable. They gave a dollar but then took it back because they felt manipulated. Now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points here are: was the donation given under duress? Did the author have the right to take it back? Also, the way the teens presented the donation\u2014using guilt\u2014might be a factor. The author felt trapped and then reacted strongly by snatching the dollar back.\n\nLegally, once a donation is given, the donor can't take it back unless there's some fraud or misrepresentation. But ethically, it's more complex. The author might feel they were pressured, so their initial donation wasn't voluntary. However, taking back a donation after the fact, especially in an aggressive manner, could be seen as rude.\n\nOn one hand, being pressured into a donation isn't great, and the author had the right to reconsider. On the other hand, once the money was given, even if under protest, the act of taking it back and shutting the door might be seen as impolite or inconsiderate. The author's reaction was intense, perhaps because of frustration, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action.\n\nAlso, the teens were collecting for UNICEF, which is a legitimate charity. The author's argument that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween is a bit of a rebuttal, but the charity's purpose is broader than that. The author's comment about giving the money for candy versus feeding a village shows a misunderstanding of how donations work. Charities use donations in various ways, and the comparison to candy costs is a bit simplistic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong not because they felt pressured, but because they took back the donation in a confrontational way after giving it. They could have refused the donation initially without the aggressive behavior. Also, taking back a donation once given, even if it was under protest, could be seen as unethical since the charity might have already committed to using that money. The author's actions might not be legally wrong, but ethically, they might not have handled the situation gracefully. The key here is the method of retrieving the donation and the harsh response to the teens.\n"
