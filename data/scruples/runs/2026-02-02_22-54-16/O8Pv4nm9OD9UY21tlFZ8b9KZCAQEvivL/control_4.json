My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was handing out Halloween candy while their family was out. Some teenagers came trick-or-treating but asked for donations for UNICEF instead of candy. The kids used a guilt-tripping approach, saying the dollar could feed a village, which the author found sarcastic. The author then took back the dollar, criticized their approach, and shut the door. Now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author gave a dollar but then took it back. Legally, once money is given, does the recipient have a right to keep it? If the author took it back, was that theft or just reclaiming a gift? Also, the author's reasoning: they felt manipulated and didn't agree with UNICEF's fundraising method. The teenagers' approach was sarcastic and guilt-tripping, which the author found off-putting.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the author gave the dollar intending it as a donation, once it's in the recipient's hands, they can't take it back. But if the transaction wasn't completed, maybe the author could reclaim it. However, in this case, the teenager took the dollar, so the author grabbing it back might be considered theft or at least a breach of etiquette.\n\nEthically, the author felt pressured and didn't want to support the method of fundraising. However, the author had the choice not to donate in the first place. By giving the dollar and then taking it back, they might have overstepped. The teenagers might have been using a manipulative approach, but the author's response of confrontation and taking back the money could be seen as inconsiderate or aggressive.\n\nAnother angle: the author's right to withdraw consent. If the donation was made under false pretenses or undue influence, maybe there's a case. But in reality, the author chose to give after being asked. Taking it back after the fact could be problematic. Also, the author's reaction might have been a result of feeling manipulated, but the method of response (snatching the dollar and yelling) might not be appropriate.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they gave the money and then took it back in a confrontational way. However, there's a strong argument that the teenagers' approach was manipulative, which could mitigate some blame. But legally and ethically, once a donation is given, retracting it isn't usually acceptable. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they took back the donation after giving it, even if they felt pressured.\n"
