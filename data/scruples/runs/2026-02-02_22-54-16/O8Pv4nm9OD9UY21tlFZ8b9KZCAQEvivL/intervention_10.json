My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who donated a dollar to UNICEF during Halloween trick-or-treating but then took it back after a sarcastic comment from the teenagers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was home alone giving out candy. The neighborhood is upper middle class, and they usually have a bowl of candy for kids. When these older trick-or-treaters came, they asked for a donation for UNICEF, saying it's for poor kids in other countries. The author felt uncomfortable, gave a dollar, but then took it back when the teens mocked the amount. \n\nThe author argues that the UNICEF representatives were using guilt-tripping tactics. They felt the way the teens presented the donation was manipulative. So, they snatched the dollar back, made a sarcastic retort about the cost of candy versus the \"feed a village\" line, and shut the door. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom one perspective, the author did give the dollar initially, which was a donation. Taking it back might be seen as rude or dishonest because the donation was already given. But the author felt pressured and the teens were mocking the amount, which could have been disrespectful. \n\nHowever, the act of taking back a donation could be considered impolite. Even if the author felt manipulated, retracting the donation after it's given might not be the right approach. Maybe a better response would have been to refuse the donation altogether if they didn't want to give. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the UNICEF representatives were using guilt-tripping tactics. The teens exaggerated the impact of the dollar (saying it could feed a village), which could be misleading. The author felt that the approach was taking advantage of the Halloween context where people might be more willing to give for candy. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a reaction to what they perceived as manipulation. However, taking back the donation after it was given might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the donor felt pressured, once the money is given, taking it back could be seen as disrespecting the other person. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the teens being sarcastic and mocking. The author was defending their own actions by pointing out the hypocrisy of using Halloween, which isn't a thing in the countries they're fundraising for. That adds another layer where the author felt the approach was inauthentic. \n\nIn terms of morality, is it wrong to take back a donation if you felt manipulated? It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say the author had the right to change their mind if they felt tricked, especially if the presentation was misleading. Others might argue that once a donation is made, retracting it is not appropriate, regardless of the situation. \n\nAlso, the author's response was confrontational\u2014snatching the money and shutting the door. That's aggressive and could be seen as rude, even if the author's feelings were hurt. \n\nSo, considering all these points: the initial donation was made under pressure, the teens were dismissive, and the author felt manipulated. The author's reaction was harsh but might be justified if they felt the donation was coerced. However, retracting a donation can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the key factors are whether the donation was coerced and the appropriateness of taking it back. If the author felt coerced, maybe they weren't in the wrong. But taking back the money might be seen as a poor way to handle it. However, given the context of the teens' behavior, the author's actions could be understood as a reaction to manipulation.\n"
