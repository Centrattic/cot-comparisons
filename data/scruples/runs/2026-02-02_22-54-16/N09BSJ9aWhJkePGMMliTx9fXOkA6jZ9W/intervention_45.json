Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter. The situation involves a friend and brother-in-law who've been acting in a way that the author and their wife find creepy. The key points are the brother-in-law's excessive focus on the 3-year-old daughter, including things like calling her \"my Betsy,\" using her in the dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, and the author finding out he planned to visit when they weren't there. Plus, there's the hygiene issue that affects the daughter.\n\nThe author confronted the brother-in-law, who became defensive and accused them of falsely accusing him of being a child molester. This led to the sister-in-law cutting off contact, which is causing tension with the wife. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author overstepped. The brother-in-law's actions do seem concerning. Referring to a young child in a possessive way, having the child's photos as screensavers, and making unsupervised visits when the parents are away could be signs of inappropriate behavior. The hygiene issue adds another layer, as it poses a health risk for the child.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the brother-in-law. While direct confrontation can be tricky, the situation involves potential harm to a child. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling accused without proof, but the author had reasons to be concerned. The user's friend also agreed it was inappropriate, which supports the author's perspective.\n\nHowever, the author should have considered the approach. Maybe discussing with the wife first, documenting the behavior, or involving other family members before directly confronting. But given the child's safety, taking action is necessary. The brother-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling attacked, but the author's intent was to protect the child, not falsely accuse.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for acting in their daughter's best interest. The brother-in-law's behavior is the real issue here, even if the confrontation caused a rift. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
