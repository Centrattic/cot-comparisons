Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has become overly fixated on the author's 3-year-old daughter. Examples given include calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, and even planning to visit without the parents' knowledge. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The brother-in-law's behavior seems inappropriate. Referring to a 3-year-old with terms of endearment typically reserved for romantic partners, having her image as a screensaver, and visiting without consent are all red flags. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern, especially since it affects the child directly.\n\nThe key here is the author's responsibility to protect their daughter. Parents have the right and duty to ensure their child's safety and well-being. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, and the author had a right to address this. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and accusation of being labeled a child molester suggests he might be in denial or unwilling to acknowledge the problem.\n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction is also a point to consider. If she's upset because she might lose her sister, it's possible she's in denial about her husband's behavior. However, the author's wife is upset about losing her sister, but the author's primary responsibility is to their daughter. The friend's agreement that the behavior is inappropriate supports the author's stance.\n\nIn terms of ethics, confronting someone about behavior that poses a risk to a child is a responsible action. The author didn't just ignore it; they tried to distance themselves first and then confronted when the situation escalated. The brother-in-law's actions in going behind their backs to visit the child are a clear breach of trust and parental authority.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely not in the wrong. They acted to protect their child, which is a parent's duty. The brother-in-law's behavior was inappropriate, and the author had every right to address it. The answer should be B (No).\n"
