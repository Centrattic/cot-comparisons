Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has become overly focused on the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The examples given include using pet names, keeping her pictures as screensavers, coming over just to see her, and even going behind their backs to visit her when they were away. The writer confronted him, leading to a breakdown in relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's actions are inappropriate. The key points here are the behavior towards a young child. Referring to her as \"my Betsy\" and using affectionate terms from a non-parent might be seen as overstepping. Having her photos as screensavers and dashboard displays could indicate an unhealthy obsession. The fact that he's coming over just to see her and ignoring adults is concerning. Additionally, the brother-in-law's hygiene issues might contribute to the discomfort.\n\nThe writer and their wife decided to distance themselves, which is a reasonable step when they feel uncomfortable. Then, the brother-in-law made plans to see the daughter without their knowledge, which is a breach of trust. The writer confronted him, leading to accusations of being accused of child molestation. The sister-in-law's reaction is also a point to consider, but the writer's intent was to protect their daughter.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the brother-in-law's behavior is problematic. The writer had a duty to address it, especially since it involved their child. The confrontation, while perhaps abrupt, was necessary to protect their daughter and maintain trust. The friend agreeing that the behavior was inappropriate supports the writer's stance. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction are unfortunate but stem from the initial inappropriate behavior.\n\nTherefore, the writer is not in the wrong. They acted to protect their daughter from someone whose behavior was concerning and crossed boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
