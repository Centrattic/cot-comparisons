Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law has been acting in a way that seems overly focused on the kid, like calling her \"my Betsy,\" putting her picture on his dashboard, coming over just to see her, and even planning to visit while the parents were away. The author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law getting defensive and accusing him of calling him a child molester. Now the sister-in-law is upset and won't talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's actions are appropriate. The behaviors described\u2014referring to the child with a nickname, having her picture on the dashboard, FaceTiming every day, and visiting when the parents aren't there\u2014could be seen as concerning. Especially since the child is very young, any behavior that could be interpreted as overstepping boundaries or showing inappropriate attention is a red flag. The author and their wife felt the need to distance themselves, which is a reasonable precaution to protect their daughter.\n\nThe author's action was to confront the brother-in-law, which led to a breakdown in the relationship. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the accusation of calling him a child molester might be his way of deflecting. But the author's intent was to address the behavior they found creepy, not to make a false accusation. The fact that another long-time friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's concern.\n\nConsidering the potential harm to the child, the author had a responsibility to act. Allowing such behavior could lead to more serious issues if left unchecked. The brother-in-law's actions could be a sign of something more sinister, and the author's intervention was a protective measure. The sister-in-law's reaction might be emotional, but the author isn't to blame for that. They addressed a legitimate concern in a direct way, which, while it might have been handled more delicately, was necessary for their daughter's safety.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They acted to protect their child, which is a parent's responsibility. The brother-in-law's behavior was problematic, and the author had the right to address it. The fallout in the relationships is unfortunate, but the author's actions were justified.\n"
