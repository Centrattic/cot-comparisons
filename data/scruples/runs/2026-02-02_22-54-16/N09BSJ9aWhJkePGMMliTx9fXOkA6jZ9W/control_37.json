Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their friend/brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details provided. The brother-in-law (let's call him Bob) has been showing excessive attention towards the daughter. He uses terms like \"my Betsy,\" has her photo on his dashboard and phone, visits just to see her, ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even planned to visit when the parents were away. Plus, his hygiene is bad, causing issues when he interacts with the child.\n\nThe author confronted Bob, who then became defensive and accused them of calling him a child molester. The sister-in-law is now cutting off contact, making the wife upset about losing her sister.\n\nNow, the core issue is whether the author was wrong to speak up. The key factors here are the actions of Bob. The behaviors described could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the child's age. Parents have the right to protect their children from any behavior that makes them uncomfortable, especially when it's one-sided and excessive. The author's actions were to address something they perceived as a threat to their child's well-being, even if it strained family relationships.\n\nBob's reaction of getting defensive and accusing them of false accusations might indicate he realized his behavior was crossing a line. The friend agreeing with the author suggests that the concern is valid. The author's main goal was protecting their daughter, which is a parent's duty. So, the author is justified in standing up for their child's safety and comfort, even if it caused a rift. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
