Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting his brother-in-law about inappropriate behavior towards his daughter. The brother-in-law has shown excessive attention to a 3-year-old, including calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and screensaver, trying to FaceTime daily, and planning visits without the family knowing. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points are the brother-in-law's actions. The behavior described could be seen as concerning, especially with a young child. The author's actions were to address this directly, which led to the brother-in-law feeling accused of being a child molester. The sister-in-law reacted strongly, cutting off contact. The author's friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, protecting a child from any potential risk is paramount. The brother-in-law's actions, while not necessarily criminal, cross into inappropriate territory. The author's response was to confront him, which is a reasonable step when concerned about a child's safety. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's upset reaction don't negate the initial concern.\n\nThe hygiene issue also adds to the discomfort, as it's another red flag. The author's friend agreeing with the assessment supports the validity of the concerns. So, the author acted in what he believed was the child's best interest. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
