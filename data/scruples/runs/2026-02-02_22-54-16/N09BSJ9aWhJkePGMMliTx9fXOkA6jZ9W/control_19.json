Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has become overly focused on the author's 3-year-old daughter. The examples given include calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy uncle term, having her picture on the dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and even planning to visit while the parents were away. The author confronted him about this behavior, leading to the brother-in-law being defensive and the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The brother-in-law's behavior does seem concerning. Referring to a young child in a way that's too familiar, having her image on personal devices, and making unsupervised visits could be seen as crossing boundaries. The author's main issue is the perceived creepiness and lack of appropriate boundaries, especially with a child under 4. The author took action after the brother-in-law made plans without their knowledge, which is a valid privacy and safety concern.\n\nThe confrontation led to the brother-in-law feeling accused of a serious crime (child molestation), which is a heavy accusation. However, the author's intent was to address the behavior they found inappropriate, not necessarily to accuse him of that. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling protective of her husband or not wanting to believe such claims. The friend who agreed with the author's assessment suggests that there was some shared concern about the behavior.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong: Was it necessary to confront him directly? Since the behavior was escalating and involved their child's safety, the author had a responsibility to act. The brother-in-law's defensive response and the sister-in-law's anger don't necessarily mean the author was wrong to address the issue. Protecting a child's well-being is a priority. The author's actions were a response to what they perceived as a threat, even if the confrontation caused a rift in the family.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The term \"child molester\" was not used by the author but by the brother-in-law as an extreme reaction. The author might have been accused of making such a claim, but the scenario doesn't state that the author used that term. The key is whether the author had a reasonable basis to be concerned. Given the examples, the behavior was indeed inappropriate, so the author wasn't wrong to address it. The fallout with the sister-in-law is unfortunate but may be a consequence of necessary actions to protect their child.\n"
