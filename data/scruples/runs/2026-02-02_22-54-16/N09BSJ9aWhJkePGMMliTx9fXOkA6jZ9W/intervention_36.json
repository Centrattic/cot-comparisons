Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by confronting their brother-in-law over his behavior towards their daughter. The scenario involves a long-time friend who married their sister-in-law. The brother-in-law has been showing what the author perceives as inappropriate attention to their 3-year-old daughter. Examples given include calling the child \"my Betsy,\" using \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having the child's picture on his dashboard and phone, visiting just to see her, and even planning to see her behind the author's back. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and a breakdown in the relationship with the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's actions are genuinely inappropriate or if the author is overreacting. The behavior described\u2014referring to the child endearingly but in a way that might be considered possessive, having photos of her, and visiting primarily to see her\u2014could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if there's a significant age gap. However, without explicit evidence of wrongdoing, it's possible the brother-in-law sees it as affectionate. The fact that a friend who knew him for years agreed it was inappropriate supports the author's concern.\n\nThe author's decision to confront him directly might have been necessary to protect their daughter's well-being and their own family's comfort. However, the confrontation led to the brother-in-law feeling accused of a serious crime, which explains his defensiveness. The sister-in-law's reaction suggests that the brother-in-law may have a different perspective on the situation, possibly seeing the attention as normal or even loving.\n\nBut considering the specific actions\u2014like planning to visit behind the author's back and the hygiene issue that affects the child\u2014it seems the author had valid concerns. The key here is the child's safety and the family's right to control who interacts with them. The author's action was to address what they saw as a threat, which is a parent's responsibility. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction might stem from feeling accused without proof, but the author's intent was to protect their family. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing the perceived inappropriate behavior, even if it caused a rift. The answer should be B.\n"
