Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has been acting in a way that the author and their wife find inappropriate towards their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law uses affectionate nicknames, has her photo on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see the kid, ignores the adults, FaceTimes every day, and even arranged to see her when the couple was away. Plus, he has bad hygiene that affects their daughter.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law took it as an accusation of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is cutting them off, and the wife is upset about losing her sister. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nHmm. I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. First, the behavior described does seem concerning. A 3-year-old is a child, and while some relatives might be overly attached, the examples given (daily FaceTime, secret plans with the child when parents are away) cross into inappropriate territory. The author's concern for their daughter's well-being is valid. \n\nThe brother-in-law's response was defensive and extreme. But the author's confrontation led to the breakdown of the relationship. Was the author justified in calling him out? In most cases, when someone's behavior is making others uncomfortable, especially with children, it's right to address it. However, the method of confrontation matters. If the author was clear and respectful, maybe they had a right. But if they were accusatory without evidence, that could be an issue. The key is the perception of the behavior. The brother-in-law might not see his actions as creepy, but the family (especially the parents) do. Parents have the authority to protect their children, so the author acting on that behalf isn't in the wrong. \n\nThe hygiene issue is a separate problem but adds to the overall discomfort. The author's friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate, which supports their perspective. The brother-in-law's reaction being so defensive and taking it as a molestation accusation is his own issue. \n\nSo, the author's actions were protecting their daughter, which is a strong point. The answer is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
