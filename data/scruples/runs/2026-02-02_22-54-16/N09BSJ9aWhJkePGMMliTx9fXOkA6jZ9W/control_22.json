Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend and brother-in-law who's been acting strangely towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted him, leading to a broken relationship and tension with the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The brother-in-law is the author's long-time friend and brother-in-law. His behavior includes calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using his photo as a screensaver, having a picture on his dashboard, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and even making plans with the mother-in-law while the author's family was away. Plus, the guy's hygiene is terrible, causing discomfort.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law took offense, implying he's being accused of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset and cutting off communication. The wife is caught in the middle, possibly losing her sister over this.\n\nNow, considering the actions: the brother-in-law's focus on a 3-year-old is indeed concerning. The examples given\u2014using affectionate nicknames, keeping the child's photo visible, seeking to see her daily, and ignoring adults\u2014could be interpreted as inappropriate. The hygiene issue adds to the discomfort, making the situation more unsettling.\n\nThe author's response was to confront him after finding out about the surprise visit. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's overreaction might be due to the sudden confrontation. However, the author's actions were based on protecting their daughter and addressing what they perceive as a threat. The sister-in-law's reaction might stem from a personal connection or feeling accused, but the author's intent was to safeguard their child.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to address the behavior. Since the brother-in-law's actions are crossing boundaries and causing harm, the author's intervention seems justified. The sister-in-law's reaction is unfortunate, but the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their family. The author shouldn't have to stay silent about something that could affect their daughter's well-being. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
