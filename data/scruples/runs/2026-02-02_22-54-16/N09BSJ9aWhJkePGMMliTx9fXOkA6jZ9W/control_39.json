Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a close friend and brother-in-law who they believe is being creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law has been acting in ways that the family finds inappropriate. He calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" refers to himself as \"uncle\" in a creepy manner, has her picture on his dashboard and phone, visits just to see her and ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even tried to visit when they were away. Plus, his hygiene is bad, which is a separate issue but also a concern.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law became defensive, accused him of implying he's a child molester, leading to a broken relationship and the sister-in-law cutting ties. The wife is upset about losing her sister. The author is wondering if they were wrong to speak up.\n\nNow, considering boundaries, especially with children. It's important to protect a child's well-being. The behavior described could be seen as overstepping. Even if not illegal, it's making the parents uncomfortable. The brother-in-law's actions, like going behind their backs to visit the daughter while they were away, add to the concern. The hygiene issue is another red flag.\n\nThe author did talk to a long-time friend who agreed it was inappropriate. So there's some validation there. Confronting someone about behavior that's making you uncomfortable isn't inherently wrong. However, the confrontation led to accusations of being a child molester, which is a serious miscommunication. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the fallout might be his fault as well.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author had the right to address the behavior. Since they're the parent, they have the authority to set boundaries for their child. The brother-in-law's actions are being misinterpreted as creepy, which could be a sign of something more sinister, even if not proven. The author's concern for their daughter's safety and their right to protect her would likely make them not in the wrong here. The brother-in-law's reaction might be his own issue, but the author's duty to their child is primary.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They had a legitimate concern and acted to protect their daughter, which is a parent's responsibility. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the resulting conflict might be on him, not the author.\n"
