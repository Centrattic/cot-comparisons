Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting a friend/brother-in-law about his behavior towards the author's daughter. The brother-in-law has been acting in a way that the author and his wife find creepy. Examples include calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using a picture of her as a screensaver, and making plans to visit her without the parents' consent. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the severity of the brother-in-law's actions. The behavior described could be seen as inappropriate, especially with a 3-year-old. The fact that the brother-in-law went behind their backs to see the child after they left is concerning. The author's reaction is to address this, which is a natural response to protect their child.\n\nThen, the brother-in-law's defensive reaction, accusing the author of calling him a child molester, might be an overreaction. The sister-in-law's upset response could be due to feeling her brother was wrongfully accused, but the author's intent was to protect their daughter.\n\nThe key points here are the protection of a minor and the appropriateness of the confrontation. The author had a responsibility to act if they felt their child's safety or well-being was at risk. The brother-in-law's actions, while not necessarily illegal, cross into inappropriate territory. The author's approach was direct, which might have been harsh, but given the context, it's understandable.\n\nHowever, the author could have considered other methods first, like discussing it with the sister-in-law before confronting the brother-in-law. But given the urgency and the potential risk to the child, the immediate action makes sense. The hygiene issue might also contribute to the overall discomfort, but the primary concern is the focus on the daughter.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the brother-in-law's behavior is the main issue. The author acted in what they believed was the child's best interest. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
