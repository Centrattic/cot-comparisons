Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a brother-in-law who's been showing concerning behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. The user is asking for a judgment on whether they did the right thing by confronting this friend/brother-in-law.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law's actions: calling the child by a nickname, using terms like \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having the child's photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, ignoring others, daily face time, and even planning to visit when the parents are away. Plus, hygiene issues that affect the child. These points add up to something that could be seen as inappropriate, especially with the child's age. The parents, the user and his wife, felt creeped out and started distancing. Then, when they found out the brother-in-law planned to visit the daughter without their knowledge, the user confronted him. The brother-in-law reacted defensively and accused the user of calling him a child molester, leading to a rift in the family.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). From the details given, the user took action because they were concerned for their daughter's safety and well-being. The brother-in-law's behavior crosses boundaries, and the parents have a right to protect their child. Confronting someone about inappropriate behavior, especially when it's affecting their child, seems justified. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction are on their side; the user isn't responsible for their reactions. The user's actions were in the interest of their daughter's safety, so they're likely not in the wrong. So, the answer should be B.\n"
