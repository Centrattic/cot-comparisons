Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a close friend and brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's obsessive behavior, like referring to the daughter as \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard, coming over just to see her, and ignoring others. There's also the incident where he went behind their backs to visit the daughter when the couple was away.\n\nThe writer confronted him, leading to a breakdown in relationships. The brother-in-law took offense, accused the writer of accusing him of being a child molester, and the sister-in-law cut off contact. The wife is upset about losing her sister. The writer's friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the writer did the right thing. The brother-in-law's actions are definitely concerning. Referring to a child under 4 as \"my Betsy\" and having daily face time, along with ignoring adults, are red flags. The hygiene issue is a separate problem but adds to the discomfort. The key here is whether the behavior crosses into inappropriate territory. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially since the writer felt it was creepy and the friend agreed.\n\nThe writer did confront the brother-in-law after trying to distance themselves first. The confrontation led to defensiveness and accusations, which is unfortunate. However, the writer's main concern was protecting their daughter's well-being and safety. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling that the brother-in-law is being unfairly accused, but the writer had valid reasons to address the behavior. The brother-in-law's response was extreme, which might indicate he's aware the behavior is inappropriate but doesn't see it that way.\n\nThe question is whether the writer was in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the brother-in-law's actions were indeed inappropriate. Since there's no evidence he actually harmed the child, but the behavior is suspicious and makes the family uncomfortable, the writer's action to confront him is justified. The writer didn't have to keep quiet, especially since it's about their child's safety. The sister-in-law's reaction is a consequence of the confrontation, not the initial behavior. So the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
