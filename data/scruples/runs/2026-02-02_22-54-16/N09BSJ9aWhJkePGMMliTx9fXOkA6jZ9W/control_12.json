Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their friend/brother-in-law about his behavior towards the author's daughter.\n\nFirst, the situation: the brother-in-law has been showing a lot of attention to the 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" setting up photos of her as his phone wallpaper, coming over just to see her while ignoring adults, and even planning to visit when the parents weren't home. The author found out through a phone call. The brother-in-law's hygiene is also an issue, affecting their couch and daughter. When confronted, he became defensive and accused the author of accusing him of being a child molester, leading to a rift with the sister-in-law.\n\nSo, the key points here are the inappropriate focus on a child, which is a red flag. The brother-in-law's actions seem to cross boundaries. Parents have the right to protect their children from such behavior. The author isn't just being paranoid; the examples given are concerning. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's anger might be because they didn't expect the confrontation, but the author had a duty to address the behavior for the child's safety.\n\nHygiene issues are a separate problem but might contribute to the overall discomfort. The author's actions were to protect their daughter, which is a parent's responsibility. The brother-in-law's reaction is extreme, possibly because he feels accused, but the author's intent was to address real concerns.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to protect their child, which is justified. The answer should be B.\n"
