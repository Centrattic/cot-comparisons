Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law refers to the daughter with affectionate nicknames, uses her photos as his screensaver and dashboard picture, makes plans to see her without the author's knowledge, and there's even an issue with his bad hygiene affecting the kid. The author confronts him, leading to a breakdown in relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the brother-in-law's actions. The behavior described\u2014calling the child by endearing terms, isolating with her, ignoring adults when around her, and using her photos\u2014could be seen as overstepping boundaries. Especially for a 3-year-old, such attention from an adult can be concerning. The hygiene issue adds another layer, as it's not just about inappropriate behavior but also potential health risks.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the brother-in-law. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and accusation of being called a child molester might be an overreaction, but the author's concern is valid. Protecting a child from any form of inappropriate attention is a parent's responsibility. The key question is whether the author overstepped by confronting him, given the circumstances.\n\nThe brother-in-law's actions, as described, do cross into problematic territory. The author was within their rights to address the behavior, especially since it's about their child's well-being. The sister-in-law's reaction suggests that the brother-in-law's actions were not just the author's perception but possibly a known issue. The friend's agreement supports that the behavior was indeed inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were justified. They were protecting their daughter from someone whose behavior was clearly inappropriate. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
