Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, the situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards his 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law refers to the daughter with terms like \"my Betsy,\" has her photo on his phone and dashboard, comes over just to see her while ignoring adults, and even tried to visit when the author and wife were away. The author confronted him, and now the relationship with the sister-in-law is ruined.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The brother-in-law's behavior seems to be crossing boundaries. A 3-year-old is a minor, and any adult showing excessive, obsessive attention could be concerning, especially if it's done in a way that others perceive as inappropriate. The examples given\u2014like using endearments, keeping photos in prominent places, and visiting without considering the parents' absence\u2014do suggest a level of focus that's not typical for a family member. The hygiene issue might be a red herring, but it adds to the overall discomfort.\n\nThe author's actions were to confront the brother-in-law, which led to the other person becoming defensive and even accusing the author of implying he's a molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is caught in the middle. The author's friend agrees that the behavior is inappropriate. \n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, protecting a child from any potential harm is paramount. The author is acting to safeguard their daughter, which is a parent's duty. Confronting someone about behavior that's deemed creepy is a reasonable step when there's a concern about the child's well-being. However, the brother-in-law's reaction suggests he might not see it the same way, leading to a breakdown in the relationship. But does that make the author in the wrong?\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, if the behavior were to be considered grooming or inappropriate attention towards a minor, the author is justified in taking action. However, without concrete evidence of abuse, it's a judgment call. But the author's perception of the behavior is valid, especially considering the examples provided. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction complicates things, but the author's intention was to address the uncomfortable situation.\n\nThere might be cultural or familial norms that influence this scenario. In some families, close relationships with nieces might be more common, but when it's perceived as obsessive or creepy, it's a different matter. The author's actions are a response to protect their child, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted on their responsibility to ensure their daughter's safety and comfort, even if it led to a fallout. The brother-in-law's behavior was the root issue, and the author's confrontation was a necessary step to address it.\n"
