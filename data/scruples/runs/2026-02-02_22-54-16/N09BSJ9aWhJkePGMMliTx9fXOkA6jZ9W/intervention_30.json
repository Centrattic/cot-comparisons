Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's showing concerning behavior towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted the friend, leading to a broken relationship and their wife's sister cutting them off. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The brother-in-law has been acting in ways that are perceived as inappropriate. Examples include calling the child \"my Betsy,\" using the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having the child's photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her while ignoring adults, and trying to FaceTime her daily. There's also the issue of his poor hygiene affecting the child. The author found out he planned to visit the daughter without their knowledge, which escalated the situation. The author confronted him, leading to defensiveness and accusations of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is torn between the two.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's behavior and the author's response. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a minor child. The author's concern for their daughter's well-being is valid, and confronting the friend is a natural reaction when boundaries are crossed. However, the confrontation led to the relationship's end and family tension. \n\nBut is the author at fault? The brother-in-law's behavior, as described, is at least inappropriate. The author didn't make up the situation; they acted based on observed behaviors. However, the way the confrontation was handled might have contributed to the fallout. Maybe a more diplomatic approach could have been taken, but the core issue is the brother-in-law's actions. The author's actions were in defense of their child and family, so it's less about being \"in the wrong\" and more about the brother-in-law overstepping. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
