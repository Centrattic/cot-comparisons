Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for addressing their brother-in-law's behavior towards their daughter. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law has been showing excessive attention to the 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" using the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having her photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults. The author found out he made plans with the mother-in-law to see the daughter while they were away. Also, his hygiene is bad, affecting the environment and the child.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction from the brother-in-law, who felt accused of being a molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The author's friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the ethics here. The brother-in-law's actions seem to cross boundaries. Personal space and privacy are important. A 3-year-old's guardian has the right to protect their child from unwanted attention. The brother-in-law's behavior could be seen as intrusive and inappropriate, especially if he's a family member. The author's action was to address this concern directly, which is a reasonable response to protect their child. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction doesn't make the author wrong. The friend agreeing with the author's assessment supports that the behavior was indeed inappropriate.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have discussed with the wife first or approached the brother-in-law more gently. But given the situation, the immediate threat to the child's safety and well-being justifies the direct approach. The key issue is the brother-in-law's behavior, not the author's method of addressing it. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their child. So the answer should be B.\n"
