Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been showing inappropriate attention towards the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law referring to the daughter with endearments, keeping her photos as screen savings and on his dashboard, visiting just to see the kid while ignoring others, and even going behind their backs to see her when they were away. The author confronted the brother-in-law, leading to a breakdown in the relationship and the sister-in-law's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the brother-in-law's behavior is indeed inappropriate. At first glance, a 40-something man with a 3-year-old niece having such intense focus could be a red flag. The examples given\u2014like calling her \"my Betsy,\" using a personal nickname, face timing daily, and keeping her pictures around\u2014could be seen as overstepping boundaries. Hygiene issues and the smell on the couch and daughter might add to the concern, though that's a separate issue but could contribute to the overall discomfort.\n\nThe author's action was to confront the brother-in-law about these behaviors. The brother-in-law reacted defensively, claiming the accusation was equivalent to calling him a child molester, which is a serious accusation. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is distressed about losing her sister.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for speaking up? Well, the brother-in-law's actions are questionable. The author had a responsibility to protect their daughter. If there's a reasonable concern about inappropriate behavior, even if not criminal, it's valid to address it. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's response might indicate that the confrontation was necessary. However, the way the author addressed it could matter. Was there evidence? Did they approach it calmly? The scenario doesn't say, but given the context, it seems like the author had legitimate concerns.\n\nThe friend agreeing that the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's side. So, in terms of right or wrong, the brother-in-law's actions are the issue. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their child. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
