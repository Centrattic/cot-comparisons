Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law has been excessively focused on the kid, using terms like \"my Betsy,\" having her picture everywhere, and even trying to see her when the parents aren't around. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as inappropriate, especially with a young child. The author's actions were to protect their daughter and address the behavior they found concerning. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's upset are also factors.\n\nI should think about boundaries and parental rights. Parents have the right to protect their children, so the author's intervention isn't unreasonable. The brother-in-law's behavior does cross into creepy territory with the child, regardless of intent. The author didn't make accusations of molestation directly but called out the behavior, which the brother-in-law took as an accusation. That's a miscommunication on his part, not the author's.\n\nAlso, the hygiene issue adds to the discomfort, making the situation worse. The author's friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate, supporting their stance. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling attacked, but the author's main concern was for their daughter's safety and comfort.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their child and addressing the concerning behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
