Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's developed an unhealthy focus on the author's 3-year-old daughter. The examples given include calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults. The author confronted him after he made plans to see the daughter without their consent, leading to a defensive reaction and the sister-in-law cutting off communication.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author overstepped. The brother-in-law's behavior does seem concerning. Referring to a young child as \"my Betsy\" and having her as a screensaver might be inappropriate. The fact that he's going behind their backs to see the child, even with the mother-in-law, is problematic because the parents should have control over their child's interactions. The hygiene issue adds to the discomfort, as it's affecting the child's environment.\n\nThe author called out the brother-in-law, which led to a defensive response and accusations of being a child molester. The key here is whether the author had a right to address this behavior. Since it's about the safety and well-being of a minor, especially when the brother-in-law is acting in a way that feels intrusive and possibly inappropriate, the author's concern is valid. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling accused, but the author's actions were in response to observed behavior that others also found concerning.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault for speaking up. Given that the brother-in-law's actions were crossing boundaries and the author's intent was to protect their daughter, it's unlikely they're wrong. The answer should be B (No), as the author acted to address what others deemed inappropriate behavior.\n"
