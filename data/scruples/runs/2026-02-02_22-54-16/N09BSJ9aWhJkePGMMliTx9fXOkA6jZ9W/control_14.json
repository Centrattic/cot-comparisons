Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family member who's acting inappropriately towards their daughter. The friend/brother-in-law has been showing excessive attention to a 3-year-old, which the author finds creepy. Examples include calling the kid \"my Betsy,\" having her picture on his dashboard, screensaver, coming over just to see her, and even going behind their backs to visit when they were out. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the appropriateness of the author's actions. The key points are the behavior of the brother-in-law toward the child. The brother-in-law's actions do seem concerning. Referring to a child as \"my Betsy\" could be seen as overly familiar or possessive. Having the child's photo as a screensaver and on the dashboard, along with constant attempts to see her, might indicate an inappropriate focus. The fact that he came over when the parents weren't there raises red flags about respecting boundaries.\n\nThe author's reaction was to confront the brother-in-law. Since the brother-in-law took offense and accused the author of implying he's a child molester, there's a breakdown in communication. However, the author's concern for the child's well-being is valid. Parents have the right to protect their children, and addressing inappropriate behavior is reasonable. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's upset suggest that maybe the confrontation was direct, but the initial behavior was problematic.\n\nThe author's actions were in response to something that could be considered creepy. The brother-in-law's own hygiene issues add to the concern. The author's main goal was protecting the child, which is a parent's responsibility. The sister-in-law might be upset because the brother-in-law is her husband, so she might not want to believe he's acting inappropriately. The author's friend agreed the behavior was not okay, adding credibility to the author's stance.\n\nIn terms of fault, the brother-in-law's behavior is the root issue. The author acted to protect their daughter, which is justified. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to being defensive of her husband. The author isn't in the wrong for addressing something that's concerning, especially since they had other people's support. Therefore, the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
