Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault. The main issue is that the brother-in-law has been acting in a way that the family finds creepy towards his niece, who's 3 years old. \n\nFirst, the brother-in-law refers to the daughter as \"my Betsy,\" uses a creepy tone, has her picture on his dashboard and phone, and comes over just to see her, ignoring adults. He even plans to visit when the parents are away. The hygiene part is a red flag too, as his smell affects the daughter.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in relationships. The brother-in-law took offense, claiming the accusation was about being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister.\n\nNow, considering the actions: the brother-in-law's behavior crosses boundaries. It's not normal for an adult to be so fixated on a young child, especially to the point of acting alone with them when the parents aren't there. The hygiene issue is another concern for the child's well-being. The author had a right to be concerned and address it, especially since they noticed a change in his behavior over time. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling accused without proof, but the examples given by the author are significant. \n\nThe author did confide in a mutual friend who agreed it was inappropriate. So the author is acting out of concern for their daughter's safety and well-being. While the confrontation might have been harsh, the underlying issues are valid. The brother-in-law's reaction could stem from feeling cornered, but the author isn't at fault for addressing potential danger. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
