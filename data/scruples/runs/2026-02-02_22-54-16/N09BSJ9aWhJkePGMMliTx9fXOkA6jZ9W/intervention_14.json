Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately around the author's 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted him, leading to a fallout with both the brother-in-law and the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The brother-in-law has been calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy tone, has a photo of her on his dashboard and phone screensaver, visits just to see her while ignoring adults, daily FaceTime requests, and even went behind their backs to see her when they were away. Plus, his hygiene is bad, affecting the daughter. The author called this out, the brother-in-law got defensive, accused the author of calling him a child molester, and the sister-in-law cut ties.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author's actions were justified. The key here is whether the brother-in-law's behavior is indeed inappropriate. The examples given do sound concerning. Referring to a young child in a possessive way, excessive attention, neglecting adults, and unauthorized visits could be seen as overstepping. The author's duty to protect their daughter is paramount. Confronting someone about behavior that could be harmful is generally reasonable, especially when it's affecting family relationships.\n\nHowever, the author might have considered approaching the sister-in-law first or documenting the behavior before confronting the brother-in-law. But given the potential risk to the child, immediate action might be necessary. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's anger don't negate the author's responsibility to act in the child's best interest.\n\nSo, the author is in the right for protecting their daughter from what they perceive as inappropriate attention. The answer should be B.\n"
