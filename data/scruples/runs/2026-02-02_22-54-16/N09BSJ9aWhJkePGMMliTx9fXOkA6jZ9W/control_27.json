Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter. The brother-in-law is a long-time friend, but in the past year, he's been acting in a way that the family finds creepy. Examples include calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" having her picture as his phone wallpaper, coming over just to see her, and even planning to visit while they were out of town.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction from the brother-in-law and a breakdown in the relationship. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's actions are genuinely concerning. The examples given do sound inappropriate, especially with a 3-year-old. Referring to her in a possessive way, having her on his dashboard and phone, and making plans to see her without the parents' knowledge are all red flags. The hygiene issue could be a separate problem but adds to the overall discomfort.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the brother-in-law. Given the circumstances, this seems like a reasonable step to protect their child. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the accusation of being accused of being a child molester might be an overreaction, but it's possible he felt misunderstood. However, the author's main concern is their daughter's well-being, so standing up for that is justified.\n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction is also a point to consider. She might feel that her husband is being accused of something serious, leading to her cutting off contact. But the author's actions were to address the behavior, not to accuse him of a crime. The friend agreeing with the author's assessment supports that the behavior was indeed inappropriate.\n\nIn summary, the author acted in their daughter's best interest by addressing the concerning behavior. The brother-in-law's defensive response doesn't negate the validity of the author's concerns. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
