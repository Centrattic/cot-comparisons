Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author has known his brother-in-law since kindergarten and they were close friends. Now, his brother-in-law married his wife's sister. Over the past year, the brother-in-law has become overly focused on the author's 3-year-old daughter. Examples given: calling her \"my Betsy,\" using his name as \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having her picture on his dashboard and as a phone screensaver, visiting just to see her and ignoring adults, daily FaceTime requests, and even planning to visit her behind the author's back when they were out of town. Plus, his bad hygiene is affecting the child.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law reacting defensively and accusing him of calling him a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset and the relationship is ruined. The author's wife is upset about possibly losing her sister.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the brother-in-law's behavior. The key issue is the inappropriate focus on a minor child. The brother-in-law's actions seem over the line. Having a 3-year-old's photo as a screensaver, visiting just to see her daily, and trying to see her when the parents are away could be seen as concerning. The author's concern for his daughter's safety and well-being is valid. Parents have the right to protect their children, and any behavior that makes them uncomfortable in that regard needs to be addressed.\n\nThe author confronted the brother-in-law, which led to a defensive reaction and accusations. But the author had valid reasons based on observed behavior. The brother-in-law's reaction might indicate he's aware his actions are inappropriate, hence the defensiveness. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to defending her husband, but the author's actions were in response to actual behaviors, not just suspicion.\n\nThe author's friend agreed the behavior was not appropriate, which adds credibility to his concerns. The key here is whether the author overstepped by confronting him. Since the brother-in-law was acting in ways that could be considered inappropriate towards a minor, the author was justified in addressing it. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting his daughter and his family's well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
