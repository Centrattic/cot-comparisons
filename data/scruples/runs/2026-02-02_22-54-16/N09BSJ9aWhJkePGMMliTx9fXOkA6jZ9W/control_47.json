Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has become overly focused on the author's three-year-old daughter. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" uses terms like \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has her picture on his dashboard and phone, visits just to see her while ignoring others, FaceTimes daily, and the author found out he planned to see the daughter behind their backs while they were away. Plus, his bad hygiene is an issue.\n\nThe author's main arguments are that the brother-in-law's behavior is inappropriate, especially since it's a 3-year-old. The brother-in-law's reaction was defensive and he accused the author of accusing him of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and their wife is torn between the sisters.\n\nFrom a legal and social standpoint, any behavior that could be interpreted as inappropriate attention towards a minor is a serious concern. The brother-in-law's actions\u2014excessive focus, constant contact, and sneaking in to see the child without permission\u2014could be seen as violating boundaries. The author has a responsibility to protect their child, so confronting the brother-in-law is a reasonable step.\n\nHowever, the approach might have been confrontational. Maybe the author should have first discussed it with their wife and sister-in-law to address the issue together. But given the potential risks to the child, the author's actions might be justified. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's refusal to speak are more about how the confrontation was handled rather than the initial concern being unfounded.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their daughter. The brother-in-law's behavior is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
