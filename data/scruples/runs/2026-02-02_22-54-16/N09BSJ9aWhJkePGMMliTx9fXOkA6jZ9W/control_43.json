Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law is a friend since kindergarten and married to the sister. The author mentions several creepy behaviors: calling the 3-year-old \"my Betsy,\" having her photo as a screensaver and dashboard, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and even going behind their backs to visit when they were out. Plus, he has bad hygiene that affects the daughter.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law being defensive and accusing him of calling him a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset and cut off contact, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The user wants to know if they're in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, any behavior that seems overly focused on a minor, especially when it's exclusive and intrusive, is a red flag. The brother-in-law's actions could be a form of grooming. The author had a duty to protect their daughter, so confronting him about these behaviors isn't wrong. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction don't negate the initial concerns. The friend agrees it's inappropriate. The author's actions were to address potential harm, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
