Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend and brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards their 3-year-old daughter. The author called out their friend for being creepy, leading to a broken relationship with their sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend has been showing an infatuation with the daughter. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her picture on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, and even trying to FaceTime every day. Then there's the incident where he planned to visit the daughter while the parents were away, which the author found out about. Plus, his hygiene is bad, affecting their home and daughter.\n\nThe author confronted the friend, who reacted defensively, accusing them of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law cut off communication, causing the wife distress. The question is whether the author is at fault for speaking up.\n\nFrom what I see, the author had a valid concern. A 3-year-old is very vulnerable, and someone focusing so intensely on a child, especially without the parents' consent, is a red flag. The friend's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The author's reaction was to protect their daughter, which is a parent's duty. The friend's defensive response doesn't justify the behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for addressing inappropriate conduct, even if it caused conflict. The key here is the safety and well-being of the child, which the author prioritized. So the answer is B (No).\n"
