Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is at fault (AITA). The key points here are about a close friend and brother-in-law who has been acting in a way that the family finds inappropriate towards the 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law refers to the daughter with possessive terms like \"my Betsy\" and sets himself up as an uncle in a creepy manner. He has the daughter's photo on his dashboard and phone, which is a red flag. He's coming over just to see the child and ignores adults, which is concerning. The fact that he made plans with the mother-in-law to see the daughter without the parents' knowledge is a big issue. The user confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and accusations of being accused of molestation. The sister-in-law is now upset and won't talk, causing a rift.\n\nThe user's actions: They directly addressed the behavior they found inappropriate. The brother-in-law's response was defensive, even going to the extreme of feeling accused of being a molester. The user's friend also agreed that the behavior was not appropriate.\n\nConsidering the examples given, the brother-in-law's actions could be seen as crossing boundaries, especially with a minor child. The user had a responsibility to protect their daughter and address the behavior. The fact that they tried to distance themselves first and then stepped in when the brother-in-law went behind their backs suggests that the user was acting in their child's best interest. The brother-in-law's reaction seems defensive and possibly in denial, which might not exonerate him. The user isn't at fault for pointing out the behavior that others (like their friend) also found inappropriate. The sister-in-law's anger might stem from feeling that her husband was accused without proof, but the user had legitimate concerns. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
