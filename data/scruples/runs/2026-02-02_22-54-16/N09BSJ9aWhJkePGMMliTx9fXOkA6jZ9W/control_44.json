Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother-in-law who has become overly focused on the writer's 3-year-old daughter, to the point of being considered creepy. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior: calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over to see her while ignoring adults, FaceTiming daily, and even going behind their backs to visit when they were away. Plus, there's the hygiene issue that affects the daughter.\n\nThe writer confronted him, and the brother-in-law became defensive, leading to a fallout in the family. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is caught in the middle. The question is whether the writer was in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the brother-in-law's actions. The behavior described is certainly concerning. Referring to the child in a possessive way, having her image on personal devices, and showing excessive interest could be signs of inappropriate attachment. The fact that he went behind their backs to see the daughter when they were out of town adds to the concern. The hygiene issue is an additional problem that affects the child's environment.\n\nThe writer's actions were to confront the brother-in-law about these behaviors. The brother-in-law took offense and accused the writer of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law cut off contact, causing family tension. The key here is whether the writer overstepped or had a valid reason to address the behavior.\n\nFrom a social and safety perspective, parents have a responsibility to protect their children. If there's a perceived threat or inappropriate behavior, it's reasonable to address it. The writer's actions seem to be in the daughter's best interest. The brother-in-law's reaction might be defensive, but that doesn't negate the initial concerns. The writer also mentioned discussing the issue with a mutual friend who agreed it was inappropriate, which supports their stance.\n\nHowever, the approach could be questioned. Maybe the writer should have involved the sister-in-law first or handled it more privately. But given the seriousness of the situation\u2014potential harm to a child\u2014acting to protect the child is justified. The brother-in-law's defensiveness doesn't absolve him of his behavior.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the brother-in-law is the one exhibiting concerning actions. The writer is responding to protect their family. While the fallout is unfortunate, the writer isn't in the wrong for addressing a potential risk to their child. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
