Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a long-time friend and brother-in-law to the person who wrote the post. The brother-in-law has been showing a lot of attention to the author's daughter, who is 3 years old. The examples given are things like calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using terms that might be considered creepy, having her picture on the dashboard and phone, visiting just to see the child and ignoring adults, and trying to FaceTime every day. The brother-in-law even went behind their backs to spend time with the daughter while the parents were away, and there's also an issue with his hygiene causing a smell problem.\n\nThe author confronted him about this, leading to the brother-in-law getting defensive and the sister-in-law cutting off communication. The wife is upset about possibly losing her sister. The author is asking if they were in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother-in-law's behavior is being perceived as inappropriate, especially given the focus on a young child. The author felt the need to step in because of concerns about the child's well-being and safety. The brother-in-law's reaction was defensive, and the sister-in-law is upset. The question is whether the author was right to confront him or if they overstepped.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, any behavior that seems to focus too much on a child, especially in a way that could be seen as inappropriate or potentially harmful, should be addressed. The author is acting in what they believe is the best interest of their daughter. While the confrontation might have been harsh, the underlying issue seems valid. The brother-in-law's reaction and the sister-in-law's response might indicate that they don't see the behavior as problematic, but the author's responsibility to protect their child is significant.\n\nHowever, the author should consider the relationship dynamics and perhaps approach the situation with more sensitivity. Maybe there was a better way to handle it without causing such a rift. But in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't at fault for addressing potentially inappropriate behavior towards their child. The brother-in-law's actions are the main issue here, and the author had a duty to protect their daughter. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
