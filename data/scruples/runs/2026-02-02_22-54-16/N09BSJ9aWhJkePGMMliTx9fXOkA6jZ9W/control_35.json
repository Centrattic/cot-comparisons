Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother-in-law who's been acting creepily towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls the daughter by a nickname, has her as his screensaver, comes over just to see her, ignores adults, FaceTimes every day, and even made plans with the mother-in-law to visit when the author's family was away. Plus, his hygiene is bad, which is an added issue.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law took it as an accusation of being a child molester, leading to a fallout with the sister-in-law. The author's wife is upset about possibly losing her sister. A friend confirmed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for speaking up?\n\nFirst, I need to assess the brother-in-law's actions. The examples given are concerning. Calling a 3-year-old \"my Betsy\" is possessive and not appropriate. Having her as a screensaver and dashboard photo, coming over just to see her, and FaceTiming daily could be signs of inappropriate attention. The brother-in-law going behind their backs to visit the child when they're away is a major red flag. The hygiene issue, while not directly related to the emotional aspect, adds to the overall discomfort.\n\nThe author's action was to confront him about the behavior. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's anger suggest that the confrontation was taken the wrong way. However, the core issue is about protecting a young child from someone who is showing signs of inappropriate behavior. Parents have a responsibility to ensure their children's safety, so addressing potentially unsafe behavior is justified.\n\nThe key point is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The behavior described is concerning, and confronting it to protect the child is a parent's duty. The brother-in-law's defensive response doesn't negate the initial issue. The friend agreeing that the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's perspective.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for speaking up. The answer should be B (No).\n"
