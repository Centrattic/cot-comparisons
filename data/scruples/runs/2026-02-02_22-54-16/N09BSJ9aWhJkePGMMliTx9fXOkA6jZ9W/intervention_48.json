Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards the author's young daughter. The author confronted him, leading to a broken relationship and the sister-in-law's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The brother-in-law has shown excessive attention to a 3-year-old, including things like calling her by a nickname, having her picture everywhere, coming over just to see her, and FaceTiming daily. Plus, there's the issue of hygiene and going behind the author's back to visit. The author called him out, leading to defensiveness and accusations of being a molester.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by confronting him. The author's actions were to protect their daughter, which is a parent's responsibility. The brother-in-law's behavior does seem concerning and potentially inappropriate. The author didn't just confront without cause; they had evidence of his actions and even a friend agreed it was not appropriate. The brother-in-law's reaction was extreme, but that doesn't make the author wrong for addressing the issue. The author is in a position to act if they believe their child's safety or well-being is at risk. The sister-in-law's anger is unfortunate, but the author's priority should be their child. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
