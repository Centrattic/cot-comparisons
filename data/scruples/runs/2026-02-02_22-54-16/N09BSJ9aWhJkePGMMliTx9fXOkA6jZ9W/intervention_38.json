Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a brother-in-law who's acting in a way that's perceived as creepy towards a 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted him, which led to a breakdown in relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The brother-in-law refers to the daughter with possessive terms like \"my Betsy,\" has personal items of hers on his phone and dashboard, comes over specifically to see her, ignores adults, and even planned to visit her when the parents were away. There's also the issue of bad hygiene affecting the daughter. The author confronted him, leading to defensive reactions and the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did the right thing by speaking up. The author's actions are driven by concern for their daughter's well-being and safety. The brother-in-law's behavior crosses boundaries that could be unsettling, even if not illegal. The author had a duty to act to protect their child. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and denial might indicate he doesn't realize the problem or is in denial. The sister-in-law's reaction could stem from defending her husband and feeling attacked. However, the author's actions were necessary to address potential harm. The friend's agreement supports the author's perspective. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to protect their daughter. Answer B.\n"
