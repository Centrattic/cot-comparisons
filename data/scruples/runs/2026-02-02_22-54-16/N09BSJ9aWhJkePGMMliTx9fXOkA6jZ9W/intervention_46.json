Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards his 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" uses the term \"uncle\" in a creepy manner, has her picture on the dashboard and as a screensaver, visits just to see her and ignores adults, FaceTimes her every day, and even tried to see her when the author's family was away. Plus, his bad hygiene is a problem. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and the brother-in-law accusing him of implying he's a child molester. Now the relationship is ruined, and the author's sister-in-law is upset, possibly leading to a loss of contact with his wife's sister.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior towards the daughter. The examples given could be seen as over-attentive or inappropriate. The author's concern is valid because a 3-year-old is a minor, and any adult's excessive focus on a child, especially in a way that's unsettling, can be a red flag. The hygiene issue is also a problem, but it's secondary to the main concern about the child.\n\nThe author decided to confront the brother-in-law after noticing the behavior over a year and distancing themselves. The confrontation led to a defensive response and accusations. However, the author's intention was to address the inappropriate behavior. The brother-in-law's reaction suggests he might be in denial or sensitive about the issue. The fact that another long-time friend agreed the behavior wasn't appropriate adds weight to the author's perspective.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the brother-in-law's actions were indeed crossing boundaries, then the author was right to act. However, the way the confrontation was handled could be a factor. The author might have approached the situation more tactfully, perhaps involving the wife or sister-in-law first to address it together, which could have mitigated the defensive reaction. That said, the brother-in-law's behavior is the primary issue here. The author's actions were protective of his daughter, which is a parent's responsibility. So, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The main issue is the brother-in-law's conduct, and the author had a duty to address it to ensure his daughter's safety and well-being.\n"
