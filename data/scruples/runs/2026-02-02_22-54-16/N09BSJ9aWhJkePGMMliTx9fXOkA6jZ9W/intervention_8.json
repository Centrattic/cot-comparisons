Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend/brother-in-law who has been acting in a way that the author considers creepy towards his 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The brother-in-law refers to the daughter with affectionate terms, keeps her pictures as screen savings and on his dashboard, comes over just to see her, ignores adults, wants FaceTime daily, and even went behind the author's back to visit the daughter while they were away. Additionally, his poor hygiene is a problem, affecting the daughter's environment. When confronted, the brother-in-law became defensive and accused the author of implying he's a child molester, leading to a rift with the sister-in-law.\n\nThe author's actions: They confronted the brother-in-law about the behavior, which led to the breakdown of the relationships. The wife is upset because she might lose her sister now.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, protecting a child from any potentially inappropriate attention is crucial. The brother-in-law's behavior, while not necessarily illegal, crosses into uncomfortable territory. The author has a responsibility to ensure their child's safety and well-being. Confronting someone about behavior that could harm their child is generally seen as justified, especially when there's a pattern of obsessive actions. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister's reaction are unfortunate, but the author's primary duty is to their child.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. The brother-in-law might have a genuine affection, but the way it's expressed is creepy. The author's approach could have been more diplomatic, but the core issue is about the child's safety. The author isn't in the wrong for acting in their child's best interest. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
