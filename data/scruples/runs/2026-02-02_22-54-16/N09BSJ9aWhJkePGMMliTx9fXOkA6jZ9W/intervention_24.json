Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a long-time friend and brother-in-law is acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted him, leading to a broken relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The uncle is being overly attentive to a young child, using affectionate nicknames, having the child's photo on his phone and dashboard, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, and even trying to see her when the parents aren't home. Plus, his hygiene is bad, which is a concern for the child's health. The author confronted him, which led to the brother-in-law accusing them of calling him a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is protecting their child from potentially inappropriate behavior. The uncle's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a young child. The key here is the age of the child and the nature of the uncle's behavior. When adults are overly focused on a child to the point of exclusion and using terms that might be considered too intimate, it can be concerning. The fact that the uncle is going behind the parents' backs to see the child adds to the concern, as parents are the primary authority in such matters.\n\nThe author isn't accusing him of committing a crime, but rather pointing out behavior that's inappropriate and making them uncomfortable. The uncle's defensive reaction and the accusation of being a child molester might be an overreaction on his part, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong to speak up. The author's duty is to their child's well-being, and if they perceived a risk, even if it's not a direct threat, taking action is understandable.\n\nHygiene issues could also be a red flag, as it's not just about affection but also about health. The author's friend agreeing that the behavior is inappropriate supports their stance. The relationship damage is unfortunate, but protecting a child's safety and comfort is a high priority. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
