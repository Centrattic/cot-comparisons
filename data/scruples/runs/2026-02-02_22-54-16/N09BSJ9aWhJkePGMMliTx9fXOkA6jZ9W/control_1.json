Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards the writer's 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law has been showing signs of obsession: calling the daughter his \"Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard, using her as his phone screensaver, and FaceTiming every day. He's also coming over just to see the kid, ignoring adults, and even tried to visit when the parents were away. Plus, his hygiene is bad to the point of leaving smells on the kid. The writer confronted him, leading to a breakdown in relationships.\n\nThe key points here are the brother-in-law's behavior towards a young child. Any adult showing such focused attention on a minor, especially with terms of endearment and daily contact, is a red flag. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as inappropriate and potentially concerning, especially since he went behind the parents' backs to visit the daughter. The writer's action was to address this behavior, which the brother-in-law took as an accusation of being a child molester. However, the writer's concern is valid given the context. The friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate, which supports the writer's stance.\n\nThe main question is whether the writer was wrong to speak out. Since the brother-in-law's actions are indeed problematic, the writer had a responsibility to address it for their daughter's safety. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction don't negate the initial validity of the concern. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for confronting the issue.\n"
