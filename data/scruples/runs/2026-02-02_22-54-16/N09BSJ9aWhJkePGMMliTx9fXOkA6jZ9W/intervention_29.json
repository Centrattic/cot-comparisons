Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a close friend and brother-in-law who's acting in a way the author finds creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior like calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, and even going behind their backs to visit when they were away. The author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law being defensive and accusing them of implying he's a child molester, which caused a rift with the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The brother-in-law's actions do seem inappropriate. A 3-year-old is very young, and the attention from an adult, especially an uncle, should be normal and respectful. Having a child's photo as a screensaver, referring to them in a possessive way (\"my Betsy\"), and going out of his way to see the child daily could be seen as concerning. The fact that the author and wife have been distancing themselves for a year shows they've tried to address it gradually.\n\nThe brother-in-law's response to the confrontation was defensive and extreme, accusing them of calling him a molester. That's a serious accusation, but maybe the author didn't use that exact term. However, confronting someone about behavior that could be perceived as inappropriate is reasonable, especially when there's a minor involved. The author's main concern is the child's safety and well-being. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling that her husband is being unfairly accused, but the brother-in-law's actions do cross a line.\n\nThe author's friend agreed that the behavior was inappropriate, which supports the author's stance. The key here is whether the author overstepped. Since the brother-in-law was acting in a way that could be considered creepy, the author had a right to address it. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction doesn't negate the initial concern. So, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
