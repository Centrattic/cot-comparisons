Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's showing concerning behavior towards the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law refers to her with nicknames, has her photo as a screensaver, visits just to see her and ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even tried to come over when the parents were away. He also has bad hygiene, which affects the child.\n\nThe writer confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction where the brother-in-law accused them of calling him a child molester. This caused a rift in the relationship between the sister-in-law and the wife. The key points here are: the brother-in-law's behavior is making the parents uncomfortable, especially since he's a family friend, and they tried to address it. The question is whether confronting him was the wrong move.\n\nFirst, consider the brother-in-law's actions. Referring to the child as \"my Betsy\" and similar terms could be seen as overstepping. The daily FaceTime, having her photo in prominent places, and visiting specifically to see her might be inappropriate, especially since the parents are distancing themselves. The writer's concern about this is valid because any adult's intense focus on a minor child can be problematic, regardless of intent.\n\nThe hygiene issue adds another layer. If his smell is affecting the child, that's a health and safety concern. The brother-in-law's reaction to being confronted\u2014defensiveness and the accusation of being accused of molestation\u2014suggests he might be in denial or unaware of how his actions are perceived. However, the parents have a right to protect their child from what they see as inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe writer's action was to call out the behavior, which is a reasonable response when they feel their child is being put in a situation they consider unsafe. Even if the brother-in-law felt wronged, the parents' responsibility is to their child's well-being. The sister-in-law's anger might stem from feeling that her husband is being accused without proof, but the parents' actions were based on their concerns.\n\nThe friend agreeing that the behavior is inappropriate supports the writer's stance. The key here is that the writer acted in their child's best interest, even if it caused family conflict. The brother-in-law's behavior is creepy and could be a red flag, so the writer wasn't wrong to address it. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
