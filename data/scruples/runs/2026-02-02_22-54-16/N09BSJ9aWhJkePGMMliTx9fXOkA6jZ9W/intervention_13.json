Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's acting in a way that's making the author uncomfortable. The key points are the brother-in-law's focus on the author's 3-year-old daughter, including calling her \"my Betsy,\" using her as a phone wallpaper, coming over just to see her, and even planning to visit when the author and wife were away. Plus, hygiene issues that affect the kid.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and the sister-in-law cutting ties. The question is whether the author did the right thing by speaking up.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law's behavior does seem concerning. Referring to a young child in a possessive way, having her photo on the dashboard and phone, and making unsupervised visits when the parents aren't there could be seen as inappropriate. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern, especially since it affects the child.\n\nThe author's actions were to address this directly when they found out about the planned visit. The brother-in-law's defensive response and the sister-in-law's reaction are their own issues. The author had a right to be concerned about their daughter's safety and well-being. Confronting someone about behavior that could be harmful isn't inherently wrong. The author also mentioned confiding in another friend who agreed it was inappropriate, which supports their decision.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached the situation more diplomatically. But given the circumstances\u2014especially the unauthorized visit when they weren't home\u2014it's understandable to act. The key here is protecting their child. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
