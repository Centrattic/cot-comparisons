Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who they believe is being too focused on their 3-year-old daughter in a creepy way. The brother-in-law has behaviors like calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her picture on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults. They also mention he had plans with the mother-in-law to see the daughter while they were away, which they found out about. The author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law getting defensive and accusing them of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset and won't talk to them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did the right thing by confronting the brother-in-law. The key points here are the brother-in-law's behavior towards the young child. The examples given could be considered inappropriate, especially the constant focus on the daughter, the use of terms of endearment that are overly familiar, and the actions of wanting to see her exclusively. The author felt creeped out, which is a valid reaction. The sister-in-law's reaction is also a factor here, but the main issue is the brother-in-law's behavior.\n\nThe author had reason to be concerned. The brother-in-law's actions might cross boundaries, especially when he went behind their backs to arrange a visit. The author's confrontation was about protecting their daughter and addressing the behavior they found concerning. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the accusation of implying molestation is a possible overreaction, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong to speak up. The author had a duty to ensure their daughter's safety and well-being, so confronting the brother-in-law was appropriate. The fact that a friend agreed with the author's assessment supports their concern.\n\nHygiene issues are another point, but that might be a separate issue. However, the main issue is the focus on the daughter. The author's actions were in response to their legitimate concerns about their child's safety and comfort. Even though it led to a family rift, the author wasn't in the wrong for addressing the inappropriate behavior. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
