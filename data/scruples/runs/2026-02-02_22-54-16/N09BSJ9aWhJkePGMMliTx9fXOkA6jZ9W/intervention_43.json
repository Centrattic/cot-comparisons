Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards the author's 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" uses creepy nicknames, has her picture on his dashboard and phone, visits just to see her and ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and went behind their backs to see the daughter when they were out of town. Also, his hygiene is bad, which is a problem when he's around the child.\n\nThe author confronted the brother-in-law, who got defensive and accused them of accusing him of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset and cut off communication, causing the author's wife to be sad about losing her sister.\n\nNow, the user asks if the author is in the wrong. I need to assess whether the author overreacted. The brother-in-law's behavior does seem concerning. The constant attention on a young child, the possessive language, and sneaking around to see her when the parents aren't there are red flags. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern, as it could affect the child's health and safety.\n\nThe author's actions were to call out the behavior, which is a reasonable response when there's a potential risk to a child. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction don't excuse the initial inappropriate behavior. The author also discussed their concerns with a friend who agreed it was inappropriate, supporting their stance.\n\nConsidering all this, the author was protecting their daughter from what they perceived as inappropriate attention. Confronting the brother-in-law about such behavior is justified, especially when it involves a minor. The author isn't in the wrong for taking action to ensure their child's safety and well-being.\n"
