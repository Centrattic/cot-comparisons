Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds inappropriate towards their 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The brother-in-law has been showing excessive attention to the daughter: calling her \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy tone, having her photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, daily FaceTimes. Additionally, he tried to visit when the parents were out, leading to the author confronting him. The brother-in-law reacted defensively, accused the author of implying he's a child molester, causing a rift in the family. The author's friend agreed the behavior was not appropriate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal and social perspective, any behavior that could be seen as inappropriate or potentially predatory towards a child is a serious matter. The brother-in-law's actions\u2014like having the child's photo as a screensaver, trying to see her when the parents aren't there, and the excessive focus\u2014could be considered concerning. The author's duty to protect their child is paramount. Confronting someone about behavior that could be harmful, even if it causes tension, is generally seen as justified. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's upset are unfortunate, but the author's primary responsibility is to their daughter's safety. The fact that a long-time friend also agreed the behavior was inappropriate adds weight to the author's perspective. The author isn't making a baseless accusation; they have specific examples and have taken steps to address it. While the confrontation may have been harsh, the intent was to protect the child, which is a valid reason. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
