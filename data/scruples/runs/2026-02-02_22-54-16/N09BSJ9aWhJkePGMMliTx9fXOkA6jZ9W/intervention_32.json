Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law, who's a long-time friend, has been acting in a way that the family finds creepy: calling the daughter \"his Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over to see her while ignoring others, and even planning to visit her when they weren't home. The author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law getting defensive and the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the brother-in-law's actions are indeed inappropriate. The key points are the focus on a very young child, using terms of endearment that might be too personal, and the unauthorized visit planned with the mother-in-law. The fact that the brother-in-law's friend also agreed it wasn't appropriate suggests there's some consensus on the behavior being odd or concerning.\n\nThe author's action was to address these behaviors directly. The question is whether the author was wrong in doing so. In such cases, protecting children is a primary concern. If there's any suspicion of inappropriate behavior towards a minor, confronting it is generally considered responsible. However, the line between concern and overreaction can be thin. The brother-in-law denying any wrongdoing and accusing the author of accusing him of child molestation is a red flag, as it could indicate defensiveness over something serious or just an overreaction. Either way, the author's duty to their daughter's safety is paramount.\n\nThe author might argue that they had a right to voice their concerns, especially since it's their child. However, the approach of directly confronting without perhaps seeking other avenues first (like involving the mother-in-law or other family members) might have contributed to the fallout. But given the circumstances, the author's actions seem justified in terms of protecting their daughter. The brother-in-law's behavior crosses into concerning territory, and the author acted to address it, which is understandable. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling that the brother-in-law is being unfairly accused, but the author's position is to protect their family. So, the author is likely not in the wrong.\n"
