Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about inappropriate behavior towards their daughter. The brother-in-law has shown signs of being overly focused on the 3-year-old, like calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his phone and dashboard, and trying to see her daily while ignoring others. He even went behind their backs to visit when they were away.\n\nThe author called him out, leading to the brother-in-law accusing them of accusing him of being a child molester, which strained the family relationships. The user thinks the author is right, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, ensuring a child's safety is a parent's priority. The brother-in-law's behavior crosses boundaries, especially with a young child. The author's action was to protect their daughter and set boundaries. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's anger are unfortunate, but the author had a duty to address the concerning behavior. The key here is that the author's intention was to protect the child, which is justifiable. So the answer is B.\n"
