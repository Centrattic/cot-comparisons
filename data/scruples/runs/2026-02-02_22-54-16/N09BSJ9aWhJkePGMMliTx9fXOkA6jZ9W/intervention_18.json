Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law is a long-time friend, but he started showing inappropriate attention to the author's 3-year-old daughter. Examples given include calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over to see her while ignoring adults, and even going behind their backs to visit when they were away. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and the sister-in-law cutting off communication.\n\nThe key points here are the actions of the brother-in-law. The behavior described seems to cross boundaries. Referring to a child as \"your\" or having personal photos and screen savers could be seen as inappropriate. The fact that he went behind their backs to see the daughter when they were away is concerning, as it shows a lack of respect for their boundaries. The author's reaction was to address these behaviors directly, which seems necessary given the potential risks to the child.\n\nHygiene issues like the smell ruining the couch and affecting the daughter are also part of the problem, but they might be secondary. The main issue is the focus on the child, which can be alarming. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the accusation of being a child molester might be his way of deflecting guilt or not taking the concern seriously.\n\nThe author's wife is upset about losing her sister, but the author's duty to protect their daughter is paramount. The friend's agreement that the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's stance. The situation seems to have escalated due to the brother-in-law's actions, not the author's. Confronting someone about behavior that could harm a child is generally seen as responsible.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They addressed a legitimate concern to protect their daughter, even if it caused a rift. The brother-in-law's actions were the root problem here.\n"
