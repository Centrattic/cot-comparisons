Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting his brother-in-law about his behavior towards his daughter. The brother-in-law has been acting in a way that the author finds creepy: calling the daughter by a pet name, having her picture on his dashboard and phone, visiting just to see her and ignoring others, FaceTime every day, and even trying to see her without the author's knowledge. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as inappropriate, especially with a 3-year-old. The uncle is showing excessive attention that borders on obsessive, which can be concerning. The mother and father are the legal guardians, so they should have control over their child's interactions. The brother-in-law's actions of going behind their backs to visit and the hygiene issues add to the concern.\n\nThe author's actions were to confront the brother-in-law, which led to the latter feeling accused of being a molester and the sister-in-law cutting ties. The question is whether the author overstepped by addressing the behavior.\n\nFrom a protective standpoint, parents have the right to ensure their child's safety and well-being. If the uncle's behavior is perceived as creepy, it's reasonable for the parents to address it. However, the way it was handled might be a factor. The author did mention they were distancing themselves first, which is a common approach before direct confrontation. The friend also agreed the behavior was inappropriate, so the author wasn't acting solely on suspicion.\n\nThe brother-in-law's defensiveness and the accusation of being a child molester is a red flag. The author's actions were in the best interest of their daughter, even if it caused family conflict. The uncle's actions crossed a line, so the author isn't in the wrong for addressing it. The answer should be B.\n"
