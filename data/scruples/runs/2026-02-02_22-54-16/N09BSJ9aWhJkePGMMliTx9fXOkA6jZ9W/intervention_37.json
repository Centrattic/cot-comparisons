Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been exhibiting behavior that the author finds creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted him, leading to a broken relationship with their sister-in-law and wife's sister. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother-in-law has a 3-year-old niece. The behaviors listed include calling her \"my Betsy,\" referring to himself as \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having her photo on his dashboard and phone screen, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, daily FaceTime requests, going behind their backs to see her when they're away, and poor hygiene that affects the child. The author confronted him, leading to defensiveness and accusations of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now cutting off contact, and the wife is upset about losing her sister.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for confronting the brother-in-law about these behaviors?\n\nI need to consider the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions. The behaviors described could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a young child. The author's concern is about their daughter's safety and well-being. The brother-in-law's defense and the accusation of molestation suggest he might be in denial or not recognizing the inappropriateness. The author's action was to address the issue directly, which is a responsible step to protect their child. However, did they have the right to do so without perhaps involving other family members first or approaching it differently?\n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction is to cut off contact, which might indicate she's in denial or defensive of her husband. The friend agrees the behavior is inappropriate, so the author isn't just being overly sensitive. The key here is the potential risk to the child versus the family relationships. The author's duty to protect their child likely takes precedence. Even if the confrontation caused a rift, the author's primary responsibility is to their daughter's safety. The brother-in-law's behavior, even if not criminal, is definitely concerning and could be a sign of inappropriate attachment. The author isn't in the wrong for taking action to address potential harm, even if it led to conflict. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
