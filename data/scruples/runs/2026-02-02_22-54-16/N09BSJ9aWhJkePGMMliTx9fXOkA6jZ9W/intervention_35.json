Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's acting in a way that the author perceives as creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. The author confronts him, leading to a broken relationship and their sister-in-law cutting them off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the facts. The brother-in-law has been referred to the daughter as \"my Betsy,\" uses a creepy tone when calling himself \"uncle,\" has a photo of the daughter on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see the kid and ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even tried to visit when the parents were away. Plus, his bad hygiene is affecting the daughter. The author called him out, and he reacted by calling the accusation a child molester claim. The sister-in-law is upset and the marriage is strained.\n\nNow, the key points here are the behavior towards a child. Even if the brother-in-law is not a pedophile, his actions could be considered inappropriate. The author took action to protect their daughter, which is a parent's duty. The brother-in-law's reaction was defensive and extreme, which might indicate he's aware his behavior is off. The author's friend agreed it was not appropriate, supporting the author's stance.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the brother-in-law's actions cross a line, then confronting him is justified. However, did the author overreact? The user thinks the author isn't wrong, and I agree. The main issue is the brother-in-law's behavior, not the author's response. The author's actions were to protect their family, which is a valid reason. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
