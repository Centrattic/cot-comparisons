Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The key points here are about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's behavior towards the author's 3-year-old daughter is causing issues. The friend refers to the daughter as \"my Betsy,\" has her picture on his dashboard, comes over just to see her, ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even tried to see her while the author and wife were away. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship with the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. The friend's actions seem concerning. The behavior described does cross into inappropriate territory\u2014especially the constant focus on a young child. The author and wife tried to distance themselves, then had to confront him after he went behind their backs to see their daughter. The friend's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's upset about being accused of being a child molester complicates things.\n\nIn most cultures, showing excessive interest in a child, especially to the point of neglecting adults and having personal items like photos of the child, is considered creepy. The fact that the husband and wife felt compelled to act after the friend went behind their backs suggests that their actions were a last resort to protect their daughter. The friend's hygiene issues also add to the problem, making interactions uncomfortable.\n\nHowever, the author could have approached the situation differently. Maybe having a private conversation with the brother-in-law to express concerns without accusing him outright might have been better. But given the repeated inappropriate behavior and the direct attempt to see the child without permission, the author's actions were justified. The question is whether confronting him was wrong. Since the friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
