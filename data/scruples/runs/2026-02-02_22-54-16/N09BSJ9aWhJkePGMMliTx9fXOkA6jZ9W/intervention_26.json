Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their friend/brother-in-law about his behavior toward the author's daughter. The situation involves the brother-in-law showing excessive attention to the 3-year-old, which the author finds creepy. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his phone and dashboard, ignoring adults, and trying to FaceTime daily. The brother-in-law also went behind their backs to arrange a visit with the daughter while they were away.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. I need to decide between A (author at fault) or B (not at fault).\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law's actions seem concerning. The author's main issue is the inappropriate focus on their young daughter. The brother-in-law is a close friend and relative, so maybe there's a history of closeness. However, the behavior described\u2014like having the child's photo on his phone, calling her possessive terms, and ignoring adults\u2014could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The author's response was to confront him, which led to defensiveness and accusations of being accused of a serious crime (child molestation). The sister-in-law is upset, and the author's wife is caught in the middle.\n\nIs the author justified in calling out this behavior? The key is whether the author overreacted. The brother-in-law's actions, while perhaps not illegal, are definitely in the realm of potentially inappropriate. Parents have the right to protect their children from any behavior they perceive as creepy, even if it's not explicitly abusive. The author didn't just confront him in a passive-aggressive way; they addressed it directly. The brother-in-law's reaction was to deflect and accuse, which might indicate he was aware his behavior was problematic. \n\nThe hygienic issue (smelling bad) adds another layer of concern, as it could indicate other issues, but it's not directly related to the main problem. However, the fact that the brother-in-law went behind their backs to see the child suggests a disregard for the parents' wishes. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's important to respect boundaries, especially regarding children. The author's actions were in defense of those boundaries. The brother-in-law's defensive response and the sister-in-law's reaction could be due to feeling accused without proof. But the author had valid concerns based on observable behavior. \n\nI think the author is in the right because they acted to protect their child and address inappropriate behavior. The brother-in-law's actions crossed lines, and the author had the right to confront him. The author isn't the one being inconsiderate here. So the answer should be B.\n"
