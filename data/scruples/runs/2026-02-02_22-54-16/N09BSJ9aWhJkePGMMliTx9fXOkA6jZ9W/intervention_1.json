Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their brother-in-law. The scenario involves the brother-in-law showing excessive, possibly creepy attention towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother-in-law refers to the daughter with terms like \"my Betsy,\" uses her photos as screensavers and dashboard images, ignores adults when visiting, and even plans to see her without the parents' knowledge. There's also the issue of his poor hygiene affecting the child. The author and wife have been distancing themselves for a year, and the confrontation happened after the brother-in-law tried to see the daughter while the parents were away. \n\nNow, the brother-in-law's reaction was defensive, claiming he was accused of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now cutting off contact, which is causing the wife distress. The user's friend agrees the behavior was inappropriate. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the brother-in-law's actions do seem concerning. The constant focus on a 3-year-old, using personal photos, and acting without the parents' consent could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The author's decision to address it directly might be justified to protect their daughter. However, the confrontation led to accusations and a broken relationship. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The brother-in-law's behavior likely crossed a line, so the author's actions might be seen as necessary. However, the author's approach might have been harsh if the brother-in-law felt falsely accused. The mention of \"child molester\" could be an exaggeration, but the behavior described does have elements that are inappropriate, like excessive attention to a child and poor hygiene in contact with her. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had a right to confront the brother-in-law. Since the parents are responsible for their child's safety, their actions to address what they perceive as a threat are understandable. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction are their own issues, but the author's intent was to protect their daughter. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is probably not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
