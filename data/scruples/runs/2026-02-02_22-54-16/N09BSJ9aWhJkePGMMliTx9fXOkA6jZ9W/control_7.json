Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's showing inappropriate focus on the author's 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls her \"my Betsy,\" has her picture everywhere, comes over to see her while ignoring adults, and even tried to visit when the author and wife were out. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in relationships. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is caught in the middle.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The brother-in-law's behavior does seem concerning. Referring to a 3-year-old as \"my Betsy\" and having her photo as a screensaver might be crossing boundaries. The fact that he went behind their backs to visit the daughter while they were away adds to the issue. The author's main concern is the inappropriate attention towards a young child, which is a serious matter.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the brother-in-law, which is a reasonable step when there's a potential risk. It's important to protect the child and address any behavior that could be seen as predatory. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the accusation of being accused of a child molester suggest he might not realize the severity of his actions or is denying them. The sister-in-law's reaction could stem from feeling attacked or misunderstanding the situation.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached the situation differently. Perhaps discussing it privately first without immediately confronting him publicly, or involving other family members for support. But given the gravity of the situation\u2014possible grooming behaviors\u2014the urgency might have been higher. The hygiene issue also adds to the discomfort, making the brother-in-law's presence around the child even more concerning.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the key points are the brother-in-law's actions and the author's response. The author had a duty to protect their daughter and address the inappropriate behavior. Confronting him was necessary to prevent potential harm, even if it caused family rifts. The sister-in-law's anger might be due to feeling that her husband was accused without proof, but the author's intent was to protect the child, which is a valid reason.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the brother-in-law's actions were inappropriate and the author acted to protect their daughter.\n"
