Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly.\n\nThe writer is a father whose long-time friend and brother-in-law has been showing inappropriate focus on his 3-year-old daughter. Examples given include calling her \"my Betsy,\" using creepy nicknames like \"uncle\" in a way that feels off, having her picture on his dashboard and as a screensaver, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, daily FaceTime attempts, and even going behind their backs to visit the daughter when they were out of town. Additionally, the brother-in-law has poor hygiene that's affecting their home environment. The writer confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law defending himself as being accused of being a child molester, which caused the sister-in-law to cut off contact.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the writer is in the wrong. The key points here are the brother-in-law's behavior towards the daughter. Actions like excessive focus on a child under the age of 4, using terms that could be interpreted as possessive or inappropriate, and trying to have constant contact could be seen as concerning. The writer's confrontation was in response to what they perceived as creepy behavior, especially after the brother-in-law tried to visit the daughter without their consent.\n\nFrom a legal and social standpoint, any behavior that could be interpreted as grooming or showing undue interest in a minor child is problematic. The brother-in-law's actions might cross boundaries, especially with a 3-year-old. The writer's concern about the child's safety and well-being is valid. The confrontation was necessary to address potential risks, even if it led to relationship strain.\n\nHowever, the way the confrontation was handled might be a point of discussion. If the writer accused him without concrete evidence, that could lead to defensiveness. But given the examples, it seems like the actions were observable and concerning. The brother-in-law's reaction of being called a child molester might be an overreaction, but the writer's intent was to address inappropriate behavior.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the writer was protecting their daughter, which is a parent's duty. The brother-in-law's hygiene issues also contribute to the problem, affecting their home environment. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling that the husband was unfairly accused, but the core issue is the inappropriate focus on the child.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the writer is acting in the best interest of their child, which is a valid reason. They were within their rights to address the behavior that they found concerning, even if it strained the relationship. The answer would likely be B, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
