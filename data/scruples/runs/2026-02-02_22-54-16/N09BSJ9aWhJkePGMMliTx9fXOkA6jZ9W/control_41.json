Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for confronting their long-time friend and brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter, which led to a broken relationship with their wife's sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details provided. The brother-in-law, who married the user's sister, has shown behaviors that the family finds concerning. Examples include using affectionate nicknames like \"my Betsy,\" setting up a photo of the child as his screensaver, and visiting just to see her, ignoring adults. He also made plans with the mother-in-law to see the daughter while the user and wife were away. Additionally, his hygiene is bad, which caused smelly issues.\n\nThe user confronted him, leading to defensiveness and accusations of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The friend agrees the behavior is inappropriate.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the user is in the wrong. The answer should consider if the brother-in-law's actions are indeed inappropriate and if the user's response was justified. \n\nThe brother-in-law's behavior could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a young child. Referring to the child with possessive terms, having her photo as screensaver, and visiting just to see her might be considered creepy. The hygiene issue adds another layer, as it's not just about affection but also about health and comfort.\n\nThe user's action was to call out the brother-in-law, which led to conflict. But given the potential risks to the child's well-being and the brother-in-law's secretive actions, the user might be protecting their daughter. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and accusations suggest he may be in denial or unwilling to acknowledge the problem.\n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction could be due to feeling betrayed or not seeing the behavior as problematic. However, the user's priority is their child's safety and comfort. The friend agreeing with the user supports the idea that the behavior is indeed inappropriate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was justified. Here, the user acted to address what they perceive as a threat to their daughter. Unless there's a misunderstanding, the user's action seems justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
