Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter. \n\nFirst, the brother-in-law is a long-time friend and family member. The key issue here is his focus on the author's 3-year-old daughter. The examples given include calling her \"my Betsy,\" setting her as his phone screensaver, having a picture on his dashboard, FaceTiming her daily, and coming over just to see her while ignoring others. There's also the incident where he tried to visit the daughter without the parents' knowledge, and his poor hygiene causing issues.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and the brother-in-law accusing them of accusing him of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister.\n\nNow, considering the behavior described: excessive attention towards a young child, to the point of being creepy. The author's concern is valid because any adult focusing so intensely on a young child can be inappropriate and potentially dangerous. The brother-in-law's actions, like sneaking in to see the child without consent, are a breach of trust. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern, especially since it affects the child.\n\nThe author's response was to confront him, which is understandable given the potential risk. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the accusation of being a child molester might be an overreaction, but it's also possible he's defensive because he feels accused of something serious. However, the author's duty is to protect their daughter, and they have the right to address behavior they find concerning, even if it leads to conflict.\n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling that her husband is being unfairly accused, or perhaps she's in denial about his behavior. The friend agreeing that the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's perspective.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author took action to protect their child, which is a parent's responsibility. The brother-in-law's actions were indeed concerning, and the author was within their rights to address it. The fallout in relationships is unfortunate, but the primary responsibility to the child's well-being overrides the family ties. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
