Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the author has a long-time friend who's also his brother-in-law. The friend has married his wife's sister. Now, over the past year, this brother-in-law has shown a lot of attention towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy tone, having her picture on his dashboard, setting it as his phone wallpaper, coming over just to see the daughter and ignoring adults, daily FaceTimes, and even going behind their backs to visit when the author and wife were away. Also, his hygiene is bad, affecting their home environment. The author confronted him, and the brother-in-law got defensive, accusing the author of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, leading to a potential rift with the wife's sister. The author's friend agrees the behavior is inappropriate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for confronting this behavior. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know if they are.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's actions are indeed inappropriate. The behavior described could be seen as overstepping. The constant attention, personal items, ignoring adults, and the behind-the-back visit all seem concerning, especially with a child. The hygiene issue adds to the discomfort.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the brother-in-law. The brother-in-law reacted defensively, which could be due to feeling accused. The sister-in-law's reaction is extreme, but maybe she's defensive of her husband. The author's wife is upset about losing her sister, but perhaps the author had valid concerns.\n\nIs the author wrong for speaking up? The brother-in-law's actions could be a red flag. As a parent, protecting the child's well-being is paramount. The author's actions were to address what he perceived as a threat, even if the brother-in-law felt accused. The friend's agreement that the behavior is inappropriate supports the author's stance.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it differently. But the situation escalated when the brother-in-law went behind their backs. The author's action was to stop what he saw as inappropriate behavior, so I think the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
