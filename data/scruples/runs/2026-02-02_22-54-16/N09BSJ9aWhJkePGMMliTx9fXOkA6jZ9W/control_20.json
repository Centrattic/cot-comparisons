Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that's concerning towards the writer's 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" uses a nickname that feels creepy, has her photo on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see the kid and ignores adults, tries FaceTime every day, and even went behind their backs to visit when they were away. Plus, his hygiene is bad to the point of ruining furniture and leaving smell on the kid. The author confronted him, he got defensive, accused of being a molester, leading to the sister-in-law cutting off contact. The wife is upset about losing her sister. A friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to confront him. Let's look at the key points. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially with a child. The author had reason to be concerned about his daughter's safety and the potential for inappropriate attention. The fact that the brother-in-law went behind their backs adds to the concern. The author's actions were to protect their family, which is a valid reason. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the accusation of being a molester might have been overreactions, but the author's intention was to address real concerns. The friend's agreement supports the author's perspective. The sister-in-law's reaction is emotional, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for standing up for their family. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their daughter and acting on valid concerns.\n"
