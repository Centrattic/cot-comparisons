Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's brother-in-law, who's a long-time friend, has been acting in a way that the author and his wife find creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" putting her photo on his dashboard and phone screensaver, coming over just to see her while ignoring adults, and even trying to FaceTime her every day. The brother-in-law also went behind their backs to visit the daughter when they were out of town. Plus, he has bad hygiene that's affecting the kid.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law got defensive and accused the author of accusing him of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, leading to a breakdown in the relationship. The wife is upset about losing her sister. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the brother-in-law's behavior was indeed inappropriate. The actions described do sound concerning. Referring to a child in a possessive way, having the child's photo as screensaver, wanting to see them exclusively, and acting in a way that's intrusive (daily FaceTime) could be signs of inappropriate attachment. Plus, the hygiene issue is a red flag as it could affect the child's well-being. The brother-in-law's actions of going behind their backs to see the daughter when they were away are definitely a privacy and trust issue.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is to protect their daughter. If they believed there was a risk, even if it's not a criminal act yet, it's their duty to address it. Confronting someone about behavior that could harm your child isn't unreasonable. The brother-in-law's defensive response and the accusation of being a child molester seem like an overreaction, but maybe he took offense where the author's intent was to set boundaries.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it differently. Perhaps a less confrontational method, like involving the wife more to address it together, or seeking mediation. But the key here is the safety and well-being of the child. The sister-in-law's reaction might stem from feeling that the brother is being unfairly accused, or maybe she's in denial about his behavior.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their daughter. The brother-in-law's actions are the root of the problem. The author's actions were in response to those behaviors. The fact that a longtime friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's perspective. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they acted to protect their child, which is a parent's duty.\n"
