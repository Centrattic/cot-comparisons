Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter. The brother-in-law is a long-time friend and brother-in-law, married to the sister of the author's wife. The key points are that the brother-in-law is overly focused on the author's 3-year-old daughter, which the author finds creepy. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her picture on the dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, and even planning a visit while the author's family was away. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and accusations of being a molester, which caused a rift in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the brother-in-law's behavior is appropriate. The actions described\u2014consistent, obsessive attention, personal affection (like calling her \"my Betsy\"), and physical presence in ways that ignore others\u2014could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a young child. The hygiene issue adds to the concern because it's not just about attention but also about the safety and comfort of the child.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the brother-in-law about his behavior. The brother-in-law reacted defensively, even making a serious accusation. However, the author's concern is about their daughter's well-being and their family's safety. The sister-in-law's reaction suggests the brother-in-law might have taken the situation more seriously, but the author's actions were based on valid concerns.\n\nThe key question is whether the author acted in the wrong by speaking up. Since the brother-in-law's behavior could be considered inappropriate and potentially harmful, the author's decision to address it is justified. The author had reason to be concerned, especially after finding out about the behind-the-back plans. The confrontation, while leading to conflict, was likely necessary to protect their child and family dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They had legitimate reasons to address the behavior, even though it caused a rift in the relationship.\n"
