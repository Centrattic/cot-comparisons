Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother-in-law who has an intense focus on their 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior: calling her \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy uncle term, having her photo on his dashboard and as a screensaver, coming over just to see her while ignoring adults, daily FaceTime attempts, and even trying to visit when the parents are away. Plus, the hygiene issue causing bad smell on the couch and on the daughter.\n\nThe author confronted the brother-in-law, who became defensive and accused them of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, leading to a rift with their sister/wife. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law's actions seem inappropriate. A 3-year-old is a child, and any adult focusing so intensely on a child, especially a niece, can be concerning. The behavior described\u2014constant contact attempts, isolating the child from others, personal items with the child's image\u2014crosses into creepy territory. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern, as it's not just about attention but also potential health risks for the child.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the brother-in-law. Given the described behaviors, this seems justified. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the accusation that they accused him of being a molester suggests he's aware his actions are wrong but is deflecting. The sister-in-law's reaction is likely due to feeling her husband is attacking her brother, which is a family conflict, but the author had a duty to protect their daughter.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong here. They noticed potentially harmful behavior and took action to protect their child. The brother-in-law's actions are the issue, not the author's response. It's reasonable to address inappropriate behavior, especially when it involves a minor. The answer should be B (No).\n"
