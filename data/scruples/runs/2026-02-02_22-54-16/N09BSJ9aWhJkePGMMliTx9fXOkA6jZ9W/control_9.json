Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter. The brother-in-law is a long-time friend who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy. The examples given include referring to the daughter with endearing nicknames, having her picture on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults. There's also the part where he went behind their backs to visit the daughter while they were away. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior towards the daughter. The examples do sound concerning. Referring to a 3-year-old as \"my Betsy\" and having her as a screensaver might cross into inappropriate territory. The fact that he's going out of his way to see her, ignoring adults, and the hygiene issues add to the concern. The author's main issue is the focus on his niece, which they perceive as creepy. \n\nThe brother-in-law's defensive reaction, claiming he's being accused of being a child molester, suggests he might not see his actions as problematic. But does that make the author wrong for speaking up? Probably not. The author has a responsibility to protect their child from any potential harm, even if the intent isn't malicious. The key here is the author's perception of the behavior as creepy and inappropriate, which others (like the friend) also agreed with. \n\nHowever, there's a risk that the author might have overreacted or misinterpreted the brother-in-law's actions. But given the examples and the sister-in-law's reaction, it's possible the brother-in-law's behavior was indeed inappropriate. The author had a right to address it, especially since it involved their child. The fact that the sister-in-law is upset might be due to feeling blindsided, but the author's priority was their daughter's safety. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
