Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the brother-in-law has been showing a lot of attention towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The examples given are that he calls her \"my Betsy,\" uses the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has her picture on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see her and ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even tried to visit when the author and wife were away. Plus, his hygiene is poor, which is affecting the child.\n\nThe author and wife have been distancing themselves. The brother-in-law went behind their backs to visit the daughter while they were out. The author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law accusing him of calling him a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the author's wife is worried about losing her sister. The author's long-time friend agrees the behavior isn't appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the brother-in-law's actions are indeed inappropriate. The way he's fixated on a 3-year-old is definitely concerning. While it's possible he's just being overly affectionate, the constant daily contact, not engaging with adults, and the secrecy suggest something more problematic. The hygiene issue adds to the concern because it's affecting the child's environment.\n\nThe author's response was to confront him after the brother-in-law went behind their backs. Confrontations can be tricky, but given the circumstances, the author had valid reasons to be concerned, especially the unauthorized visit. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the accusation of calling him a molester might be his way of deflecting or overreacting, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for speaking up.\n\nThe key points are the well-being of the child and the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's behavior. The author acted to protect his daughter and their family, which seems reasonable. The sister-in-law's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is attacking her husband, but the author's priority was the child's safety. Since the friend also agreed the behavior was inappropriate, the author isn't acting out of nothing.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. He had valid concerns and took action to address them.\n"
