Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for confronting their friend/brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the key points: The brother-in-law has been showing excessive attention to the daughter, using terms like \"my Betsy,\" having the child's photos on his phone and dashboard, trying to FaceTime her daily, and even planning to visit when the parents weren't home. There's also the issue of his bad hygiene affecting the daughter. The author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law feeling accused of being a child molester and the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nNow, considering appropriateness. The brother-in-law is a sibling to the wife, so family dynamics matter. The actions described could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a young child. The author's concern is valid because parents have the right to protect their children from inappropriate attention. The brother-in-law's reaction might be defensive, but that doesn't negate the author's right to address the behavior. The question is whether the author was wrong to speak up. \n\nThe brother-in-law's actions include things like using possessive terms, exclusive focus on the child, and visiting without consent. These could be signs of inappropriate attachment. The author's confrontation was a response to protect their daughter, which is a parent's duty. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction are their own issues, but the author isn't at fault for standing up for their child's well-being. Also, the friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate, which supports the author's stance.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong) because the author acted to protect their daughter from what they perceived as concerning behavior, which is a parent's responsibility.\n"
