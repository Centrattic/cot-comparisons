Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend and brother-in-law who's been acting creepily towards the author's daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior towards the 3-year-old, like calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and phone, trying to FaceTime daily, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults. Then there's the incident where he planned to visit the daughter while the author and wife were away, behind their backs. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship with the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong by confronting the brother-in-law. The brother-in-law's actions seem concerning, especially regarding a young child. The examples given could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the sister-in-law isn't aware of the extent of his behavior. The author's main issue is protecting their daughter and ensuring her safety, which is a parent's responsibility. The brother-in-law's hygiene is also a problem, but the main issue is his focus on the child.\n\nThe author didn't just confront without cause; they had multiple examples and even a friend agreed it was inappropriate. They had been distancing themselves before the confrontation. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and accusation about being called a child molester might be his way of deflecting. The sister-in-law's reaction could stem from feeling the accusation was baseless or not wanting to believe her husband is doing anything wrong.\n\nBut the author's actions were in response to observed and agreed-upon inappropriate behavior. The question is whether the author overstepped by confronting him. Since the brother-in-law was acting behind their backs to see the daughter, the author had a right to address it. However, the confrontation might have been harsh, but given the circumstances, it's hard to say the author is at fault. The main issue is the brother-in-law's behavior, not the author's response to protect their child.\n"
