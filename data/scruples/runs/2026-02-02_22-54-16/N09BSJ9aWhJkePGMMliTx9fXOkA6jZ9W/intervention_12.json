Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is at fault. The situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards his sister-in-law's daughter. The person (the author) confronted their brother-in-law, leading to a fallout with both the brother-in-law and his sister (the author's wife's sister). The author is wondering if they did the wrong thing by speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother-in-law has a 3-year-old niece. He calls her \"my Betsy,\" uses a creepy tone, has her photo on his dashboard and phone, visits just to see her and ignores adults, FaceTimes her daily, and even tried to see her when the parents were away. Plus, his hygiene is bad, affecting the environment and the child. The author confronted him, leading to accusations of being a molester, and the sister-in-law cut off contact. The wife is upset about losing her sister.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is wrong. Let's consider the brother-in-law's actions first. Referring to a 3-year-old as \"my Betsy\" and other possessive terms is inappropriate. Having her photo on personal items and FaceTiming daily could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially if the parents are uncomfortable. The fact that he went behind their backs to see the child when they were away is a serious breach of trust. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern, as it affects the child's environment.\n\nThe author's response was to address the behavior directly. The brother-in-law became defensive and accused the author of falsely accusing him. The sister-in-law's reaction is to cut off contact, but the author's actions were in response to their brother's behavior. The author's concern is for their daughter's well-being and their own family's comfort. They also discussed it with a mutual friend who agreed it was inappropriate, which suggests there's some validation.\n\nIs there a boundary violation here? Yes. The brother-in-law's focus on the child, while possibly not malicious, is inappropriate and makes the parents uncomfortable. The author had a right to address it to protect their daughter. However, the confrontation might have been handled differently. Maybe approaching the sister-in-law first, or involving a professional if there were real concerns about the child's safety. But given the information, the author's main issue was the brother-in-law's behavior, which they perceive as creepy. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's anger might be due to feeling accused without sufficient evidence. However, the author's actions were in response to actual behaviors that they found troubling.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a legitimate concern about their child's well-being and the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions. The fallout is unfortunate, but the root cause is the brother-in-law's behavior, not the author's decision to speak up. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
