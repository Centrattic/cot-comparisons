Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior: calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using creepy terms like \"uncle,\" having her photo as a screensaver and on the dashboard, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, daily Facetimes, and going behind their backs to visit when the family was away. Also, his hygiene is bad to the point of affecting the daughter and furniture.\n\nThe writer confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and accusations of being a child molester, causing the sister-in-law to cut ties. The wife is upset because she might lose her sister. The friend agrees the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law's actions seem concerning. Any behavior that focuses obsessively on a minor child, especially by a relative, needs scrutiny. Having personal photos of a child on devices and in the car, ignoring adults, and persistent contact could be seen as inappropriate. The hygiene issue adds to the problem, as it's harmful to the child's well-being if she's exposed to bad smells.\n\nThe writer's response was to confront the brother-in-law, which is a reasonable step given the circumstances. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's anger might be due to feeling accused, even if the writer was justified. The main question is whether the writer's actions were wrong. The actions taken were in response to what they perceived as inappropriate and potentially harmful behavior towards their daughter. The writer had a duty to protect their child, so confronting the brother-in-law was necessary. The brother-in-law's defense and the sister-in-law's reaction don't negate the initial issue. The friend agreeing with the writer's assessment supports that there was a problem. Therefore, the writer is not in the wrong for addressing the behavior that could jeopardize their daughter's safety and their family's trust.\n"
