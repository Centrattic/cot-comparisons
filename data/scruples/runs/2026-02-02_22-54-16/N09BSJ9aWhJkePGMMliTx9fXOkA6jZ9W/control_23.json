Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has shown excessive focus on the writer's young daughter.\n\nFirst, the key points: the brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" uses himself as \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has a picture of her on his dashboard, phone screensaver, comes over just to see her, ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even went behind their backs to see her while they were away. Plus, his bad hygiene affected their home and daughter's clothes. The writer confronted him, leading to a defensive response and the sister-in-law cutting off the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the brother-in-law's behavior is appropriate. The writer took action to protect their daughter, which is a parent's duty. The brother-in-law's actions seem to cross boundaries, especially the part about going behind their backs. The friend agreed it was inappropriate. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to her husband's defensiveness or her own denial, but the writer isn't wrong for protecting their family. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
