Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law has been showing excessive attention, like calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard, and trying to FaceTime every day. He even went behind their backs to see the kid while the parents were away.\n\nSo, the author called him out, which led to the brother-in-law getting defensive and accusing them of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the relationship with the wife's sister is in trouble. The question is whether the author was wrong to speak up.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law's actions are definitely concerning. The constant focus on a 3-year-old, the personal items, and the invasion of privacy by going behind their backs\u2014those are red flags. Any parent would be justified in feeling threatened by someone who's overly attached to their child, especially if it's inappropriate.\n\nThe author's actions are in response to these behaviors. They tried to distance themselves first but then had to confront the situation when the brother-in-law crossed a line by involving the mother-in-law. The defense from the brother-in-law is extreme and dismissive, which probably made the situation worse. However, the author's intent was to protect their daughter, which is a valid parent concern.\n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling attacked or not understanding the severity of the behavior. The author's friend also agreed it was inappropriate, which supports their stance. So, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing the issue. They had a responsibility to act when they saw something that could potentially harm their child. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the fallout aren't the author's fault; they were protecting their family. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
