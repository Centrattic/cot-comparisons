Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the brother-in-law has been acting in ways that the family finds concerning. He refers to the daughter with terms like \"my Betsy,\" has her photo on his dashboard and phone, and seems to prioritize seeing the child over others. The author and their wife have been distancing themselves because of this. Then, the brother-in-law made plans to see the daughter without their knowledge, which the author found out about when they were away.\n\nThe key issue here is the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's behavior. The examples given do seem odd and possibly inappropriate, especially given the age difference and the fact that he's a father figure. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship. \n\nThe user argues the author isn't in the wrong. Considering that the brother-in-law's actions could be seen as crossing boundaries, especially involving a minor, the author had a responsibility to address it. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling accused, but the author's concern is about their daughter's safety and well-being. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. While the behavior might be creepy, the author called the brother-in-law out directly, which led to conflict. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like involving other family members or professionals. But given the situation, confronting the issue seems necessary to protect the child. \n\nSo, the author likely isn't in the wrong. They were trying to protect their daughter from someone's potentially inappropriate behavior. The brother-in-law's actions and the subsequent defensive reaction from the sister-in-law are issues on their end. The answer should be B.\n"
