Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author considers creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior like calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" having her picture as his screensaver, coming over to see her while ignoring adults, and even planning to visit when the parents are away. The author confronted him, which led to the brother-in-law becoming defensive and accusing them of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is caught in the middle.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did the wrong thing by confronting the brother-in-law. The brother-in-law's actions seem concerning, especially given the age of the child. It's important to consider if the author's actions were justified given the potential risk to their daughter. The author's concern about the uncle's behavior being inappropriate is valid because any behavior that could be misinterpreted as inappropriate towards a child is a serious issue. The uncle's actions, like having the child's photo as a screensaver and trying to visit when the parents are away, cross boundaries that are typically considered wrong. The author's response was to confront him, which is a responsible step to protect their child. While it led to a breakdown in relationships, the author's primary responsibility is to their daughter's safety. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction don't negate the initial concern. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing the issue. The answer should be B.\n"
