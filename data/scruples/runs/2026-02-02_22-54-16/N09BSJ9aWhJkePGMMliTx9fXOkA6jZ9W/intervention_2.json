Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting his brother-in-law about his behavior towards the author's daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother-in-law has been showing excessive attention to a 3-year-old, which the author finds creepy. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and even going behind their backs to visit when they were out. Also, his bad hygiene is a problem, affecting the kids' environment.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law reacted defensively, accusing the author of accusing him of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, leading to a rift. The wife is caught in the middle.\n\nNow, considering the brother-in-law's actions: focusing so much on a young child, especially in ways that seem possessive and to the exclusion of others, could be seen as inappropriate. The author's concern about their daughter's safety and well-being is valid. The brother-in-law's behavior might cross boundaries, especially if he's using his position as an uncle to have close contact with the child without the parents' consent.\n\nThe author's decision to confront the brother-in-law was about protecting their child. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the accusation of being a molester suggests he might not see his behavior as problematic. However, the author might have approached it in a way that was too confrontational, leading to the breakdown in the relationship. But given the situations described, the key issue is the brother-in-law's actions, not the author's response to protect their family.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I agree because the core issue is the brother-in-law's behavior. The author had the right to address it to protect their daughter. The problem lies in the brother-in-law's actions and the sister-in-law's reaction, not the author's initial confrontation.\n"
