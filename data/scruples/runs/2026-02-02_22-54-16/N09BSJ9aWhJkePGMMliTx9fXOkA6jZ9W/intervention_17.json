Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting creepily towards the author's daughter. The key points are that the brother-in-law has been overly focused on the 3-year-old, using nicknames, having her photo as his screensaver, coming over just to see her, and even planning to visit when the author's family was away. Then the author confronts him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nHmm. The author mentions examples that sound inappropriate. Referring to the child as \"my Betsy\" and using the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way could be signs of inappropriate attention. The brother-in-law's actions, like having a picture on his dashboard and screensaver, and trying to FaceTime daily, seem obsessive. The hygiene issue might be a red flag too, as it could affect the child. The fact that he went behind their backs to see the daughter when they were away is a major privacy violation. \n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law reacted defensively, even accusing the author of accusing him of being a molester. The sister-in-law is upset and cutting off communication. The author's wife is worried about losing her sister. The author's friend agreed it was not appropriate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, protecting a child from someone's suspicious behavior is a parent's duty. The brother-in-law's actions are concerning, and the author had a right to address it. Confronting him directly when there's evidence of inappropriate behavior seems justified, especially after the behind-the-back visit. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction don't necessarily mean the author was wrong. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author should have tried to address it more privately first? However, given the severity of the actions (planning to visit when they're away), immediate action might be necessary. The key is that the author was protecting their daughter. The brother-in-law's hygiene and focus on a 3-year-old are definitely problematic. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
