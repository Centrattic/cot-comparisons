Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who is acting inappropriately towards the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior: calling the child \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy tone, having the child's picture on his dashboard and phone, visiting just to see her while ignoring others, FaceTiming daily, and even planning to see her when the parents are away. Plus, his bad hygiene is a problem. The writer confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship with his sister (the writer's wife) and the brother-in-law accusing the writer of implying he's a child molester.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions. The behavior described\u2014referring to a young child in a possessive way, excessive attention, and trying to see her without the parents' knowledge\u2014could be considered inappropriate or even predatory. The fact that the writer's friend also agreed it's not okay adds weight to that. \n\nNext, the writer's response: confronting the brother-in-law about the behavior. This seems like a reasonable action when someone's behavior is making them uncomfortable and could potentially harm their child. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and escalation to calling the writer an accuser of child molestation might be an overreaction, but the writer had a right to express their concerns. The brother-in-law's actions were indeed questionable, so the writer isn't the one at fault here.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong for speaking up. Since the brother-in-law's behavior crosses boundaries, the writer's intervention is justified. The sister-in-law's upset is also a result of the brother's actions, not the writer's initial confrontation (though the way it was handled might have been a factor, but the core issue is the brother-in-law's behavior). The writer's actions were protective of their child and addressing legitimate concerns. Therefore, the answer is B, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
