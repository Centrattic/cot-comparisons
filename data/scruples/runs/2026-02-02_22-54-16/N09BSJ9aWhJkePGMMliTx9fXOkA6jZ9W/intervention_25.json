Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting his brother-in-law about what he perceives as creepy behavior towards his 3-year-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the situation: the brother-in-law (longtime friend) has been showing excessive attention towards the daughter. The examples given are calling her \"my Betsy,\" setting up pictures of her as his screensaver and dashboard, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and even trying to visit when the parents were out. Plus, there's the issue of his hygiene causing smells. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the brother-in-law's actions towards a young child. The author is concerned about potential inappropriate behavior, even if not proven. The brother-in-law took offense, claiming being accused of being a molester, and the sister-in-law is upset. The author's friend agrees the behavior is not appropriate.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, any behavior that focuses intensely on a young child, especially when it's exclusive and secretive, can be a red flag. Parents have a right to be protective. The author's actions were to address what he saw as a threat to his child's well-being. Even if the brother-in-law denies it, the author's concern is valid given the examples provided.\n\nThe problem is the brother-in-law's actions crossed boundaries. Using terms of endearment that are too personal, having the child's image in personal spaces, and attempting to visit without the parents' knowledge are all concerning. The author's confrontation was to protect his daughter, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling the brother-in-law was unfairly accused, but the author had reasons based on observed behavior. The friend's agreement adds credibility to the author's concerns.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for acting in his child's best interest. The brother-in-law's behavior is the issue here.\n"
