Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for confronting their brother-in-law and friend about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law is acting in a way that the family finds creepy\u2014calling her \"his Betsy,\" putting her photo on his dashboard, FaceTiming daily, and showing up unannounced. The key points here are the child's safety and the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions.\n\nFirst, any adult showing excessive, inappropriate attention to a child, especially a minor, is a red flag. The brother-in-law's actions, like having the child's photo as a screensaver and making unilateral plans to see her while the parents are away, could be seen as concerning. The author's reaction is to address this behavior, which is a parent's responsibility to protect their child. \n\nThe brother-in-law's defensive response and accusation of being called a child molester is a problem, but the author isn't at fault for pointing out the issues. The sister-in-law's reaction is also an issue, but again, the author's priority was their daughter's safety. The friend's agreement that the behavior is inappropriate supports the author's stance.\n\nIn family dynamics, especially with close relatives, boundaries are important. The author didn't just make assumptions; they observed over a year of behavior and discussed it with a trusted friend. Confronting the situation was necessary to prevent potential harm, even if it caused a rift. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
