Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their friend/brother-in-law about his behavior towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The key points here are the specific actions the brother-in-law is taking, the author's response, and the resulting fallout.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law has been calling the daughter \"my Betsy\" and referring to himself as \"uncle\" in a creepy way. He has her photo on his dashboard and as a screensaver, which might indicate an unhealthy fixation. He's coming over to see her while ignoring the adults, trying to FaceTime her every day, and even made plans to see her when the author's family was away, using the mother-in-law as a babysitter. Plus, his bad hygiene is causing problems. \n\nThe author felt creeped out and decided to confront him, which led to the brother-in-law becoming defensive and accusing them of calling him a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The friend they confided in agreed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The brother-in-law's actions seem to cross boundaries. A 3-year-old is a young child, and the man's behavior\u2014excessive attention, constant attempts to contact, and the use of photos\u2014could be seen as inappropriate, especially if it makes the parents uncomfortable. The author's reaction was to address the issue directly, which is understandable given the potential risk. \n\nBut maybe the author should have handled it differently. Instead of a direct confrontation, perhaps they could have involved the wife first, or maybe the sister-in-law. However, the author has a right to protect their child, and the behavior described does raise red flags. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the accusation of being a molester might be an overreaction, but it's the author's duty to voice their concerns when they feel their child's safety or well-being is at risk. \n\nThe friend agreeing that the behavior was not appropriate supports the author's viewpoint. The act of the brother-in-law going behind their backs to see the daughter is a breach of trust. So, while the confrontation might have been harsh, the underlying concern is valid. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their child and addressing the inappropriate behavior. The brother-in-law's actions are the main issue here.\n"
