Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has been acting in a way that the author considers creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The brother-in-law refers to the child with terms like \"my Betsy\" and \"uncle\" in a creepy manner. He has a photo of the child on his dashboard and phone, visits just to see her, ignores adults, and FaceTimes daily. He also went behind their backs to visit the child when the author and wife were away. Additionally, his hygiene is bad, causing issues. The author confronted him, leading to defensiveness and accusations of being accused of being a molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister.\n\nI need to determine if the author's actions were justified. The brother-in-law's behavior seems concerning, especially with a young child. The author's actions were to confront the inappropriate behavior, which could be seen as protecting their daughter. However, the way they confronted him might have been too harsh, especially if the brother-in-law felt accused without evidence. The friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate, supporting the author's stance.\n\nPotential issues: The author didn't provide concrete evidence of the brother-in-law's intentions beyond their perception. They might have jumped to conclusions. However, the actions described (excessive attention to a child, ignoring adults, going behind their backs) are red flags. The author's intent was to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the confrontation was justified due to genuine concerns for the child's safety, then no. But if they acted without evidence and caused unnecessary harm, maybe. However, given the described behaviors, the author likely had good reason to act. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
