Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a close friend and brother-in-law developing a concerning focus on the writer's 3-year-old daughter. Examples include nicknames like \"my Betsy,\" having the child's photo on his phone and dashboard, coming over just to see the kid, and ignoring adults. There's also an incident where he tried to visit the daughter without the parents' knowledge, and his poor hygiene is a problem.\n\nThe user (the author) confronted the brother-in-law, leading to a defensive reaction where he was accused of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The author's friend agrees the behavior is inappropriate.\n\nSo, the key points are: the brother-in-law's actions are creepy and intrusive, especially given the child's age. The author had a right to be concerned about their daughter's well-being and safety. Confronting someone about inappropriate behavior is generally acceptable, especially when children are involved. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction doesn't negate the initial issue. The author's actions were protective, not malicious. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
