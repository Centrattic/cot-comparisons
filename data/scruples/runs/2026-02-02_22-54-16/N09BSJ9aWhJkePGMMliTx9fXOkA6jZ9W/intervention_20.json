Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law is a friend since kindergarten and the husband of the author's sister. The brother-in-law has been showing a lot of attention to the author's 3-year-old daughter. Examples given include calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her picture on his dashboard and phone, wanting to FaceTime daily, and coming over just to see her while ignoring adults. The author and wife are distancing themselves, and the brother-in-law secretly planned to visit the daughter when they were away, without their knowledge. The author confronted him, he got defensive, accused the author of accusing him of being a molester, and caused a rift in the family.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother-in-law's behavior seems inappropriate and intrusive towards a 3-year-old, especially the secrecy and the hygiene issues. The author acted to protect their daughter and address the boundary violations. The brother-in-law's reaction was defensive and extreme, leading to a broken relationship with the sister.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a child's safety perspective, any suspicious behavior from a relative should be addressed. The brother-in-law's actions could be crossing lines, even if not illegal, they're creepy. The author had valid concerns about their child's well-being. Confronting someone about inappropriate behavior is reasonable, especially when it's about protecting a child. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister's reaction might be due to feeling accused, but the author's intent was to protect their daughter. The author isn't in the wrong here because they prioritized their child's safety over maintaining the relationship. The friend agreed with the author's assessment, supporting that the behavior was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
