Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault (AITA). The situation involves a brother-in-law who's been acting in a concerning way toward the author's 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law refers to the daughter with terms of endearment, has her photo on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see her, ignores adults, and even tried to make plans to see her when the author and wife were away. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship and the sister-in-law cutting ties.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The brother-in-law's behavior does seem inappropriate. Having a 3-year-old's photo on a dashboard and phone, calling them \"Betsy,\" and focusing exclusively on the child while ignoring adults could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern, as it's not just about the attention but also about potential health risks for the child.\n\nThe key points here are the brother-in-law's actions versus the author's response. The author noticed these behaviors over a year, distanced themselves, and then confronted the brother-in-law when he made plans to see the daughter without their knowledge. The confrontation led to the brother-in-law becoming defensive and accusing the author of implying he's a molester, which escalated tensions.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is to protect their daughter. The brother-in-law's behavior crosses into inappropriate territory, especially with a young child. The author's action of calling out the behavior is a protective measure. The sister-in-law's reaction of cutting ties might be due to feeling that the accusation was too harsh, but the author had valid concerns. The friend's agreement that the behavior was not appropriate supports the author's stance.\n\nPotential counterarguments could be that the author didn't give the brother-in-law a chance to explain his actions or that the confrontation was too direct. However, given the ongoing and concerning behavior, a direct approach was necessary to ensure the child's safety. The author didn't make a false accusation; they addressed real concerns. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction doesn't negate the validity of the author's concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. Their actions were a reasonable response to protect their daughter from inappropriate attention, even though it resulted in strained family relationships.\n"
