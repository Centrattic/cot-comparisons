Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their friend/brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the situation: The brother-in-law has been showing excessive, possibly inappropriate attention towards the daughter. Examples include using affectionate nicknames, having her photos on his phone and dashboard, FaceTiming daily, and trying to see her when the parents aren't there. Plus, his hygiene is bad, which is causing issues. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and the brother-in-law accusing them of implying he's a molester. The sister-in-law is now cutting ties.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author's main concern is the child's safety and well-being. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially since the child is very young. The author took action to protect their daughter, which is a parent's responsibility. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the accusation might be his way of deflecting, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to speak up.\n\nHowever, the author's approach could be questioned. Did they handle it in a way that was confrontational or could have been more constructive? But given the behavior described, it's understandable that the author felt compelled to act, especially after the brother-in-law tried to see the child behind their backs. The hygiene issue is also a legitimate concern for the child's health.\n\nThe friend agreeing that the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's stance. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their daughter. Even if the confrontation led to a breakdown in the relationship, the priority was the child's safety. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
