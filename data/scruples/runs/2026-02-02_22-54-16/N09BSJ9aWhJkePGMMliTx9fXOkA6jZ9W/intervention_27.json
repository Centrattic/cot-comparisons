Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law's actions: calling the kid \"my Betsy,\" using \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having a photo on his dashboard and phone screensaver, coming over to see her and ignoring adults, FaceTiming every day. The author mentions these behaviors made him uncomfortable. Then, the brother-in-law made plans to see the daughter after the family left town, behind their backs. The author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law taking the accusation very seriously, even calling it a molestation claim. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author's actions were justified. The key here is whether the brother-in-law's behavior crossed a line. A 3-year-old is a child, so any adult showing excessive, inappropriate focus could be concerning. The examples given do seem odd\u2014having the child's photo as screensaver, FaceTiming daily, ignoring adults. The author's reaction is to confront him, which is reasonable if they felt the behavior was harmful. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling accused without proof. However, the author did talk to a mutual friend who agreed the behavior was inappropriate, which adds some support to their concerns.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for confronting him? Well, it's their child, and they have a right to set boundaries. The brother-in-law might not recognize his actions as wrong, but the author's duty is to protect their daughter. The confrontation could have been handled more diplomatically, maybe by first talking to his wife (the sister-in-law) to avoid direct conflict, but the author's intent was to address the issue. The brother-in-law's reaction was perhaps overzealous, but the author isn't wrong for pointing out the behavior. The hygiene issue also affects the child, so that's another valid concern.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their child from what they perceived as inappropriate behavior, even if the approach caused a rift. The brother-in-law's actions do seem concerning, and the author had a responsibility to address them.\n"
