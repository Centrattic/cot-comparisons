Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after confronting their friend and brother-in-law about his behavior towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The examples given include the man referring to the daughter with a nickname, having her photo as a screensaver, creeping out the author by focusing solely on the child, and making plans to see her when the author and wife were out of town. The author called him out, leading to the brother-in-law feeling accused of being a child molester and the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's behavior is indeed inappropriate. The actions described\u2014using a nickname, having the child's photo on his dashboard and phone, ignoring adults, FaceTiming daily, and making secret plans to see her\u2014could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a minor. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern, as it might affect the child's well-being.\n\nNext, the author's response: they confronted the brother-in-law about these behaviors. The key question is whether the confrontation was justified. The author felt the behavior was creepy and that the boundaries were being violated. However, the brother-in-law took it as an accusation of child molestation, which is a serious charge. The author might have handled the confrontation in a way that felt accusatory rather than a concern for the child's well-being. But given the examples, the behavior does seem excessive and potentially concerning.\n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction is also important. If she's upset about losing her sister, maybe she's in denial about the problematic behavior. The friend's agreement that the behavior is not appropriate supports the author's perspective. However, the author's approach might have been too direct, leading to defensiveness. But the alternative of keeping quiet could risk the child's safety or the family's discomfort.\n\nIn terms of legal or moral wrong, the author isn't necessarily at fault for addressing their concerns. Parents have a right to protect their children. The brother-in-law's actions, while not illegal (if they're just photos and FaceTime), do cross into inappropriate territory, especially with a young child. The author's decision to speak up was about setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The fallout is unfortunate, but the author's intentions were to protect their daughter, which is a valid reason. So the answer is B.\n"
