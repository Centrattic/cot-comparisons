Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that an 18-year-old guy's 20-year-old girlfriend got pregnant while on the pill, and he's pressuring her to have an abortion. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Both are young, in university, with limited financial resources. The girl was on the pill but missed doses due to her schedule. The guy is shocked and feels a bit tricked because she didn't mention the risk. He asks her to have an abortion and says he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby. \n\nI should think about consent and shared responsibility. The girl was on the pill, which is her method, but maybe they should have used a backup like condoms. However, relying solely on the pill is common, but the guy might assume it's foolproof. The girl didn't communicate her issues with the pill, which is a problem. But is it her fault entirely? She's 20, so she should know to manage her contraception. But maybe the guy should have been more proactive in using protection too.\n\nThe guy's response is to insist on an abortion. Is that fair? It's her body, so pressuring her to abort could be seen as controlling. Even if he's not ready, the decision should be hers. He's using the pregnancy as a reason to end the relationship if she doesn't comply. That's pretty harsh. He's placing the burden of the decision entirely on her, which might make him the asshole. Also, he's threatening to cut her off if she doesn't abort, which is a big ultimatum. \n\nBut the user argues the author isn't wrong. Maybe because both were unprepared, and the guy is not ready. However, the ethical aspect is that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is hers, not his. Pressuring her could be seen as wrong. Even if he's not ready, it's not his choice to make. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's pressuring her to make a decision that's ultimately hers. Even if they're both young and unprepared, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't abort\u2014is problematic. The girl should have the autonomy to decide her own body, regardless of his feelings.\n"
