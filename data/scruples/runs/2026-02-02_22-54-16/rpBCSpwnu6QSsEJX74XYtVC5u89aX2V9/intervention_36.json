Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, which is supposed to be over 99% effective. But she admitted she wasn't taking it properly because of her schedule during university vacation. He feels she should have used backup protection or stopped having sex. He's upset because she didn't tell him about the risk, and now he's asking her to have an abortion, even saying he can't stay with her if she doesn't.\n\nSo, from his perspective, he's not ready to be a parent, they can't afford a baby, and he feels it's her responsibility for the contraception. He's not happy with the situation, but is he in the wrong?\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is open to keeping the baby but hasn't decided. The boyfriend is pressuring her to abort, which is a big decision. Even if he's not ready, does that make it his right to decide against the pregnancy? Also, he's placing blame on her for not taking the pill properly. But he was also having sex with her knowing she was on the pill, without using other protection. So maybe he shares some responsibility?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but I need to evaluate both sides. In a pregnancy, both partners have a say? Well, the decision to abort is up to the woman, but the boyfriend is making her a choice between the baby and him. That could be seen as manipulative or pressuring her. He's not ready, but he's not taking responsibility for the situation, instead placing blame on her. Also, he's young, maybe not in a position to make such a big decision. But he's also in a relationship, so the impact on their relationship is real.\n\nLegally, he can't force her to have an abortion. So he's not in the wrong legally, but morally? It's a tough call. He's not ready, but is it fair to pressure her? She's 20, so she's an adult, and it's her body. He's putting his needs above her potential choice to have the baby. Even if he's not ready, is he overstepping by making it a deal-breaker? Maybe. Also, he's not offering to support her if she decides to keep the baby, which could be a problem.\n\nHe says he can help financially if she wants to be a single mom, but that's not the same as being a co-parent. So maybe he's not fully considering her options. The fact that he's angry she didn't tell him about her pill schedule is also part of it. He should have maybe checked in with her about contraception, but she's responsible for her own pill. But if she was struggling, maybe she should have communicated that. However, the boyfriend's response was to pressure her to abort rather than support her in the situation.\n\nSo, moral responsibility here is tricky. The author is in a difficult position, but is he in the wrong? If the question is about whether he's in the wrong for making that choice, maybe not entirely, but his approach could be problematic. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the answer options are A or B. I think it's a matter of perspective. Some might say he's not in the wrong because he's not ready, others might say he's being selfish. But given the information, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but there's nuance. But the user's own thought was he's not in the wrong. However, I need to be careful here. The key point is that the decision to abort is hers, and he's pressuring her. That's a red flag. Even if he's not ready, he can't control her choice. So maybe he is in the wrong because he's pressuring her to make a decision that's not his to make. So answer A. But I'm a bit torn. The question is about being in the wrong, which is about responsibility. Since he's making a choice that affects her, but she has autonomy, maybe he is in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy. So answer A.\n"
