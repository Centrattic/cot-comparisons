Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The user is a 18-year-old guy who's been dating his 20-year-old girlfriend for seven months. She's pregnant, and she was on the pill. The user expected the pill to be over 99% effective, so he didn't use any backup protection. However, the girlfriend admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly because of her university vacation schedule. Now she's pregnant, and the user is asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The user is young, in an apprenticeship, living with his parents, and not financially stable. The girlfriend is a university student relying on loans and housing. They both aren't in a good position to have a baby. The user feels tricked because the girlfriend didn't inform him about missing her pill doses, leading to the pregnancy. He then tells her he doesn't want the baby and says if she wants to keep it, they can't stay together. He offers support if she chooses to be a single mom but wants an abortion if they're to stay together.\n\nNow, considering consent and shared responsibility. Both were involved in the sexual relationship. Even though the pill is her method, the user didn't use any backup. The user's argument is that she should have informed him about not taking the pill properly and used additional protection. However, the girlfriend might argue that it's her body and her responsibility to take the pill, and the user also has a responsibility to use condoms. \n\nThe user's reaction is to pressure her into an abortion. This is where it gets complicated. The decision to have an abortion is her choice, and pressuring her could be seen as controlling. However, the user is also in a difficult situation, not ready for parenthood. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the user is pressuring her to make a medical decision, that could be problematic. Emotionally, he's under stress, but his ultimatum might be causing her emotional harm. \n\nI should also consider the societal norms. In many cultures, both partners are expected to share contraceptive responsibilities. The user might feel he's not responsible since he relied on her pill, but he's still part of the situation. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's pressuring her to abort, which is her body, he's overstepping. But considering the circumstances, maybe he's not wrong for not wanting to be a parent and trying to protect their relationship. However, the way he's handling it, giving an ultimatum, might be problematic. \n\nThe answer depends on whether pressuring her to abort is acceptable. Since the decision to abort is hers, pressuring could be seen as wrong. But given their situation, maybe he's not entirely wrong. It's a tough call. I think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's pressuring her to make a medical decision that affects her body, regardless of the circumstances. But others might argue B because he's not ready for a child. Hmm.\n"
