Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20, the author is 18, and they've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and he's upset she didn't use contraception properly. She was on the pill but missed doses during university vacation. He feels she should have used condoms or told him to stop having sex. Now he's asking her to abort, saying he can't handle a child and won't stay with her if she keeps the baby.\n\nHmm, so from a moral standpoint, does he have the right to pressure her into an abortion? The key here is that the decision about abortion is typically up to the woman. Even though he's not ready for a child, it's her body. By essentially giving her an ultimatum\u2014abort or lose him\u2014he's putting pressure on her choice. That's problematic because it's her autonomy. Also, he's blaming her for not handling contraception, which is a shared responsibility. Maybe he should have checked in more on the pill usage.\n\nHe also mentions feeling tricked because she didn't tell him about missing doses. But she might not have known for sure she was going to miss them. The pill's effectiveness relies on daily use, and if she's struggling, maybe she should have used backup methods. But he expected her to take it properly, which is a bit harsh. He could have been more proactive in discussing contraception.\n\nThe fact that he's threatening to leave if she doesn't abort shows he's not supporting her in her decision. If she wants to keep the baby, he's not willing to stay. That's a lack of support. Even if he's not ready for a child, the relationship should be able to handle that together. However, he's still a teenager, so his perspective might be limited by his age.\n\nLegally, he's not the one who can make the decision. Ethically, he's in a position of power in the relationship, and his ultimatum could be coercive. The response should consider that the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring her to make a decision about her body and is not taking shared responsibility for the situation. Even if his reasons are valid (not ready for a child), the way he's handling it is not appropriate. So the answer would be A.\n"
