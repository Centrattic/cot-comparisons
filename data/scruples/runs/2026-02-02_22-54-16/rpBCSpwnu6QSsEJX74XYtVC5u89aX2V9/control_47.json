Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a young couple in a seven-month relationship, both in university, and the girlfriend is pregnant. The guy is 18, she's 20. He's asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. So if the woman doesn't want to have the abortion, the man can't force her. The author is essentially saying that if she wants the baby, he can't stay with her, which might be a form of coercion. But since it's her body, his stance could be seen as putting pressure on her to make a decision that's against her wishes, even if he's not physically forcing her.\n\nNext, the contraception aspect. The woman was on the pill but missed doses during vacation. The author expected her to know the risks and to communicate if she wasn't taking the pill properly. While it's true that the woman is responsible for her contraception, the man could have also considered using a backup method. The fact that he didn't might mean he shares some responsibility. However, he might not be aware that she wasn't taking the pill correctly. But he's upset she didn't tell him, which is a valid point because open communication is key in a relationship.\n\nEmotionally, the author is in a tough spot. He's a teenager, not financially stable, and feels unprepared. His reaction might stem from fear and not being ready for parenthood. But ending the relationship over this could be seen as selfish or not taking responsibility. The question is whether his actions are wrong because he's not forcing her but is ending the relationship if she chooses to keep the baby. That could be a way to avoid responsibility without considering her autonomy and feelings.\n\nAlso, the girl is open to keeping the baby but doesn't know for sure. The author is making a demand based on his own readiness, not hers. She might feel pressured into an abortion she's not comfortable with. The author's statement that he can't stay with her if she has the baby might be pushing her towards an abortion to save the relationship, which ethically is problematic because it's her decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in a difficult situation, but his approach of making the abortion a condition for staying in the relationship could be seen as wrong because it pressures her into a decision that should be hers alone. Even if he's not forcing her, the emotional pressure and lack of mutual support might make him in the wrong. However, if the relationship is ending because he's not ready, that's his choice, but the way he's handling it, especially making the abortion a deal-breaker, might be where he's wrong.\n"
