Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to think through this. The author is a 18-year-old guy who's in a situation where his girlfriend of seven months is pregnant. He's asking if he's at fault for pressuring her to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 20, on the pill, but she missed doses during her vacation. The author believed the pill was over 99% effective and didn't use backup. Now, she's pregnant, and he's not ready for a child, given their financial and living situations. He ends up telling her he can't stay with her unless she has an abortion.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, the decision to have an abortion is typically up to the person who is pregnant. Even though both partners might be involved in the decision, the final choice is the woman's. The author is putting pressure on her to have an abortion, which could be seen as invalidating her autonomy. \n\nHe's also blaming her for not taking the pill properly, which might be a point of conflict. But even if she's responsible for contraceptive use, the decision about the pregnancy is hers. By making her choice a condition for staying in the relationship, he's essentially giving her an ultimatum that could be emotionally manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, he's young and not in a position to support a child. His concerns about financial stability and living arrangements are valid. However, the way he's approaching the situation\u2014threatening to leave unless she has an abortion\u2014might be seen as selfish and not respecting her agency. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. They may not have discussed their readiness for parenthood earlier. The author's anger and ultimatum could be seen as immature, especially considering their ages and the circumstances. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a tough spot, but by pressuring the girlfriend to abort and using the relationship as leverage, he's overstepping. The decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right, and pressuring her in this way is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
