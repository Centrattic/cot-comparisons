Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an 18-year-old guy who's asking his 20-year-old girlfriend to have an abortion after she gets pregnant despite being on the pill.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is young, in an apprenticeship, and living with his parents. He's not financially stable. His girlfriend is a university student, also not in a position to have a baby. She was on the pill but missed doses during her vacation. He feels she should have used backup contraception or told him when she wasn't taking the pill correctly.\n\nHe confronts her, says he doesn't want the baby, and essentially gives her an ultimatum: abort or he'll leave her. He offers to support her financially if she wants to be a single mom but can't stay with her if she keeps the baby. He's conflicted but insists he's not ready for parenthood.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Both are young and not in a position for a child. Contraception is a shared responsibility, but the guy expected the pill to be effective. The girl missed doses but didn't communicate that. However, even with the pill being 99% effective, there's a 1% chance, which happened here. The guy's reaction is to force an abortion, which is a major decision and a right the woman should have autonomy over.\n\nIn many places, the decision to have an abortion is the woman's choice. By pressuring her to abort, the author is undermining her autonomy. Even if he's not ready, the pregnancy is hers to manage. He's offering to pay for it, which could be seen as a form of control. Also, he's ending the relationship if she doesn't comply, which is not fair. They're both young and the situation is stressful, but the right to make reproductive choices is a key factor here.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not in a position to support a child and might be realistic about their circumstances. But using her decision to keep the child as a reason to end the relationship is problematic. He should've discussed options together rather than ultimatums. The fact that he's not taking responsibility for contraception fully (they didn't use back-up) is another point. Maybe he should've pushed for condoms when she mentioned missing pills.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is putting pressure on his girlfriend to make a decision that's hers to make. Coercing someone into an abortion is generally seen as wrong, regardless of the situation. Even if he's not ready, the choice isn't his to make. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
