Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is young\u201418 and 20, both in university. The girlfriend is pregnant, and the author is saying it's because she didn't take the pill properly, even though they weren't using backup contraception. He's upset because he feels she didn't inform him about the risk and now they're not ready for a baby. He tells her he can't be a parent now and that if she wants to keep the baby, he can't stay in the relationship. He offers financial support if she becomes a single mom but insists on an abortion if they stay together.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and legal aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is the woman's right. The author is pressuring his girlfriend to make a choice that affects her body. Even if he's not ready for a child, it's not his decision to make. The girlfriend is old enough to make her own medical decisions, and the author is essentially saying he can't be in a relationship with her if she doesn't comply. That seems like he's placing the burden of the decision solely on her and not respecting her autonomy.\n\nHe also mentions she's open to keeping the baby but doesn't know her true feelings. He's making a ultimatum, which is a heavy decision for her to face. Even though he loves her, by putting her in this position, he's not supporting her in the decision-making process. It's important to note that the responsibility of contraception isn't just on the woman. They were relying on the pill, which is her responsibility, but they could have discussed other methods or backup options. The author might feel betrayed, but that doesn't justify controlling her decision about her own body.\n\nLegally, in most jurisdictions, the woman has the right to choose an abortion. So, the author doesn't have the legal authority to make that choice for her. Ethically, it's about mutual respect and shared decision-making. By essentially telling her she has to abort to keep the relationship, he's not respecting her autonomy and is making a choice that could have lifelong consequences for her.\n\nAdditionally, the author is in a position of emotional leverage here. He's threatening to leave the relationship if she doesn't agree to the abortion. That's a form of emotional manipulation, as it's using their relationship as a bargaining chip in a decision that should be hers alone. Even if he's not ready for a child, he should be supporting her through this decision, not forcing his will on her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's autonomy and is pressuring her into an abortion to preserve the relationship. The decision about the pregnancy should be hers, and he's not in a position to dictate that choice, especially under threat of ending the relationship.\n"
