Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 18-year-old guy who asked his 20-year-old girlfriend to have an abortion after she got pregnant. They've been dating seven months and weren't using backup contraception because she was on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. The girlfriend mentioned she wasn't on her normal schedule due to university vacation and had trouble taking the pill daily. The guy feels she should have communicated better and now is making her choose between the abortion or him leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including whether to continue a pregnancy. While the man is involved in the decision, ultimately, it's her choice. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for pressuring her to abort.\n\nThe guy is 18, still in an apprenticeship, living with his parents, and not financially stable. He's not ready for a child, which is understandable given his age and circumstances. However, by making her an ultimatum\u2014abort or he leaves\u2014this could be seen as pressuring her, which is problematic. The girlfriend is 20 and also a student, so she's also not in a stable position either. Both are young and not prepared for parenthood.\n\nBut the key point is that he's putting the decision on her, essentially saying he's not willing to be part of the child's life if she chooses to keep it. Ethically, he has no right to force her to terminate the pregnancy, even if he's the father. The woman's autonomy is paramount here. However, he's expressing his own limitations and not being ready, which isn't entirely his fault either. But the way he's handling the situation\u2014giving her an ultimatum\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate or selfish, especially if he's not offering support for her decision to keep the child.\n\nThe girlfriend admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly but didn't communicate that. She's responsible for her own contraception, but the guy expected her to use it properly without backup. In a relationship, communication is key. Both have some responsibilities here. However, the man's response is to place the burden entirely on her, which might be unfair. He's choosing to end the relationship rather than support her if she chooses to keep the child. That seems harsh, especially if he claims to love her and not want to lose her.\n\nThere's also the emotional impact. He's causing her distress by making her choose between her autonomy and their relationship. Even if he's not ready, pushing her towards an abortion when she's considering keeping the baby is a major decision that affects her life. The fact that he's willing to offer financial support if she wants to be a single mom shows he's aware of his responsibilities, but not wanting to be involved is another matter.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, there's a debate on whether either party is at fault. The man's age and inexperience might make him less equipped to handle the situation maturely. The woman's failure to use contraception properly or communicate her schedule issues is also a factor, but it's not excusable in the sense that she should have been more responsible. However, the man's ultimatum is where the ethical line is crossed. He's not taking accountability for his own part in the situation beyond expecting her to manage contraception correctly.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the man is in the wrong because he's pressuring the woman to make a life decision that's ultimately hers, rather than supporting her regardless of her choice. Even if he's not ready for parenthood, his response is not the woman's responsibility to resolve. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
