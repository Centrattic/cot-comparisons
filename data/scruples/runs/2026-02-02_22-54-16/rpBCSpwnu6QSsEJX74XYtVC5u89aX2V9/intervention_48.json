Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user (18M) is dating his girlfriend (20F) for seven months. She gets pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill but missed doses during her university vacation. He felt she should have used backup protection or told him to stop having sex. He's not ready for a child, given their financial situations, and he ends up pressuring her to have an abortion or else he can't stay with her. He's conflicted but stands by his decision, even though it's causing them both pain.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. Contraception responsibility: the pill requires daily use, and missing doses can reduce effectiveness. The girlfriend admitted she wasn't taking it properly. The boyfriend expected her to manage it better, but maybe he should have considered using backup methods as well. In a sexual relationship, both partners have a role in contraception, right? So maybe the boyfriend shares some responsibility here.\n\nBut he's 18 and in an apprenticeship, so he's still young. The girlfriend is 20 and a student. Both are in a position where having a child would be a huge burden. However, the boyfriend is making the decision to end the relationship if she doesn't abort the baby. That part is really important. Even if he's not ready, the decision about the pregnancy should be the woman's to make. By pressuring her to have an abortion or leave, he's essentially taking away her autonomy. That's a big issue.\n\nAlso, he's not considering her feelings and her potential desire to keep the baby. He says she's open to keeping it but doesn't know if she really wants it. Then he uses that as a reason to push for abortion. It sounds like he's not respecting her agency in this situation. Even if he's not ready, the right to decide about the pregnancy lies with the woman. So maybe he's in the wrong for making that ultimatum.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not the one carrying the baby, so his perspective is different. But that doesn't mean he can dictate her choice. The situation is complex, but the key point is that the decision about pregnancy is hers. Pressuring her to abort to save their relationship is controlling and not respecting her autonomy. So, maybe the answer is that he's in the wrong (A). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The user says he feels it's not his fault, but is it? He might share some responsibility for not using backup, but the ultimatum is a major issue. So overall, I think the boyfriend is in the wrong.\n"
