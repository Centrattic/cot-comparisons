Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy and the man suggesting an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The boyfriend is 18, the girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. The girlfriend is on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she missed some doses during her vacation, leading to a pregnancy. She didn't mention this to the boyfriend, and he feels shocked and betrayed because he assumed she was taking it properly. He's not in a position to have a child, and after some emotional back and forth, he tells her he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby and insists she get an abortion. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, let's consider the key points. The girl was on the pill, but missed doses. She didn't inform her partner about her missed doses or the potential risk. The boyfriend feels that since the pill is 99% effective, she should have taken it properly and discussed alternative contraception if needed. He's young, not financially stable, and doesn't want to be a parent. He's making a decision based on his current life situation. However, the girl is open to keeping the baby, but he's imposing his decision on her regarding the abortion.\n\nNow, legal and ethical considerations. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. The boyfriend doesn't have the authority to make that decision for her. Even if he feels responsible, the right to choose is typically hers. By pressuring her to have an abortion, he's not respecting her autonomy. This could be a significant factor in determining if he's in the wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's reaction might be seen as taking a stance that the responsibility is entirely on the girl, even though they both engage in the sexual activity. While the girl did miss her pill, the assumption that she took it correctly might be her responsibility, but the boyfriend didn't use backup methods either. So, maybe both share some responsibility.\n\nEmotionally, the boyfriend is in a tough spot. He's young, not ready for parenthood, and feels betrayed. However, his approach of ultimatum (abort or lose me) is problematic. It puts pressure on her and doesn't consider her wishes. The girl might want to keep the baby, and he's not willing to support her in that choice, which could lead to her being a single mother. While he offers financial support, the emotional and practical support might not be there.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's age and maturity. At 18, he's still in a developing stage, and the girl is 20, also young. Their life circumstances don't support raising a child, but the decision to abort shouldn't be based solely on their readiness. However, the girl does have the right to make that decision. The key issue here is whether he's respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn terms of responsibility for the contraception, the girl was on the pill, but the boyfriend could have suggested using condoms as backup. He might feel that she should have taken responsibility for her method, but in reality, both partners share responsibility for contraception. The fact that she didn't inform him about her missed doses is a problem, but he also didn't use backup methods. So, there's shared responsibility, but the decision to abort is ultimately hers.\n\nPutting it all together: The boyfriend is pressuring the girl to have an abortion, which is her decision to make. By making an ultimatum, he's not respecting her autonomy and is using emotional manipulation. Even though he's not ready for a child and they have financial issues, he's not in the right because he can't dictate her medical decisions. So the answer would be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
