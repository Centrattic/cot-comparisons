Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a young couple facing an unexpected pregnancy and the author pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She's on the pill but missed doses, leading to pregnancy. The author feels shocked and upset because he expected her to take the pill properly and communicate if she couldn't. He then tells her he doesn't want the baby and won't stay with her if she proceeds with the pregnancy, effectively pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nNow, the key points: The woman is the one carrying the child. Her autonomy over her body is a major factor. The author is making a decision that directly affects her body and her choices. Even if he feels unprepared, the decision to abort is hers alone. By setting conditions on staying in the relationship based on her choice, he's potentially using emotional pressure. \n\nAlso, the author is placing blame on her for not using contraception properly. While communication is important in a relationship, the responsibility for contraception isn't solely on the woman. The pill is the woman's responsibility, but the couple should have discussed backup methods, especially if there's a risk of missed pills. The author's reaction seems to stem from feeling betrayed, but that doesn't negate her right to make her own decisions about her body.\n\nMoreover, pressuring someone into an abortion can be seen as coercive. The girlfriend is open to keeping the baby, which the author acknowledges, but he still insists on an abortion. This could be seen as disregarding her potential wishes and not supporting her, regardless of the outcome. The author's focus on his own readiness and financial status is valid, but it shouldn't override her autonomy.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, there's a debate about shared responsibility in such situations. However, the woman's right to choose remains a central issue. The author's actions might be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, as he's not considering her feelings or potential desire to have the child. He's also not offering support if she decides to keep the baby, which could be a more mature approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is pressuring his partner to make a medical decision that she has the right to make independently. By tying the future of their relationship to her choice, he's being controlling and not respecting her autonomy. Therefore, he is in the wrong."
