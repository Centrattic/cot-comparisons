Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The user is a 18-year-old male in a seven-month relationship with a 20-year-old female. She got pregnant, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the basics of consent and responsibility. Both partners share responsibility for contraception. Even though she was on the pill, which is highly effective, it's not 100% foolproof. She mentioned missing doses during her vacation, which is a known reason for reduced effectiveness. The user expected her to be on the pill properly, but he didn't use any backup method. So maybe he shares some responsibility for not using condoms or discussing her pill adherence.\n\nThe user is upset that she didn't inform him about the risk of her missing doses. However, it's not clear if she was aware of the risk herself. She might have thought the pill was working as intended. The user's anger might stem from feeling blindsided, but in a trusting relationship, it's possible he might have assumed she was taking it correctly. But that's an assumption on his part. It's not her duty to inform him about every missed pill unless they had an open discussion about backup methods.\n\nNow, the main issue is his response. He says he can't stay with her unless she has an abortion. He's offering financial support if she wants to be a single mom but is effectively saying that if she doesn't abort, their relationship is over. This is a significant demand. Even if they both feel unprepared, the decision to abort should be hers, not a condition for the relationship. By making the choice about the pregnancy contingent on their relationship's continuation, he's using emotional pressure and control.\n\nThe user's argument is that it's not his fault she didn't handle contraception. But in reality, both are responsible. Contraception is a shared responsibility. If she was struggling with the pill, maybe they should have discussed alternatives or used condoms. His reaction of cutting off the relationship if she doesn't abort is manipulative and places the burden entirely on her, which is not fair. It's important to note that the decision to have an abortion is a major one, and pressuring someone to make that choice, especially in an ultimatum, is wrong.\n\nAlso, considering their ages and circumstances, both are young and in university. They might not be emotionally or financially ready for parenthood. But the key point is that the decision to terminate the pregnancy must be the woman's choice. The user's ultimatum undermines her autonomy and makes it seem like the pregnancy is solely her responsibility, which isn't the case. \n\nIn conclusion, while both partners share some responsibility for contraception, the user's approach of making an ultimatum about the abortion is wrong. He's pressuring her into a decision that's not entirely his to make and using their relationship as leverage. Respect for her autonomy and shared responsibility are key here, so the answer is likely that he is in the wrong.\n"
