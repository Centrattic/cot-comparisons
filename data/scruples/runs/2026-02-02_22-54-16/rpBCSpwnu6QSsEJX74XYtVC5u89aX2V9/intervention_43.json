Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is that they're both young, in university, and not in a financial position to have a child. The girlfriend is on the pill but missed doses during vacation, leading to a pregnancy. The author says he's not ready for a baby and can't support it financially, so he told her he can't stay if she doesn't abort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that the girlfriend should have used backup contraception if she was struggling with the pill. He feels she should have communicated better, maybe used condoms or stopped having sex. He's also worried about their future and the impact on their relationship. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that she's doing the best she can and that the decision to abort is a big one that shouldn't be made solely by him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a personal decision. The author isn't in a position to make her have an abortion, but he's also expressing his own situation and not being ready. However, pressuring someone for an abortion can be seen as wrong because the decision should be mutual and the woman has the right to choose. The author's statement that he can't stay with her if she has the baby might be seen as putting all the responsibility on her, which could be unfair. \n\nSo, while he's being honest about his feelings and circumstances, the way he's approaching the situation might be considered selfish or not considering her autonomy. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's pressuring her for a decision that affects her body and future. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because he's not in a position to support a child. But I think the key point here is the pressure and lack of support if she chooses to keep the baby, which is a significant issue.\n"
