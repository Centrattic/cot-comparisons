Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that the guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20, they've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill. He didn't think she was taking it properly, and he's upset that she didn't mention the risk or use backup protection. He's asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their ages and maturity. Both are young, in their early 20s. They're students, not in a stable financial position. The guy lives with his parents and has an apprenticeship with a small wage. The girl is on student loans. So, they're clearly not in a position to raise a child. That's a big factor.\n\nHe says he felt tricked because she didn't tell him she wasn't taking the pill properly. But she did admit she was struggling with the schedule. The pill requires daily intake, and she's on vacation, which might disrupt her routine. However, she didn't communicate that to him, which is a problem. But he also didn't check in with her about her pill usage? Maybe they should have had that conversation earlier.\n\nHe confronts her after the pregnancy is discovered. He's shocked and angry, which is understandable given their circumstances. He tells her he's not ready for a child and that he can't stay with her if she has the baby. That's a heavy decision. He offers support if she chooses to have the baby but wants her to abort if they are to stay together. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, abortion is a personal decision, and the woman has the right to choose what's best for her. By pressuring her to have an abortion, is he respecting her autonomy? If she's open to keeping the baby but hasn't made up her mind, pushing her towards one option might be problematic. He's making her decision based on his inability to handle a child, not necessarily her wants or needs.\n\nAlso, he's placing blame on her for not using protection properly. Even though she was on the pill, which is effective when used correctly, but if she didn't take it as prescribed, that's her responsibility. But maybe they both should have used backup methods like condoms. However, the guy didn't mention that he thought she wasn't taking the pill right. He expected her to take responsibility, but maybe he should have checked in with her about her pill usage, especially during her vacation.\n\nHis reaction is harsh, telling her she can't have the baby unless she aborts and wants to stay with him. That seems like he's putting pressure on her to terminate the pregnancy to keep their relationship. That could be seen as selfish or not considering her feelings and choices. Even if they can't support a child financially, the decision to abort should be mutual, not forced.\n\nHe mentions that the idea of abortion breaks his heart, but he's not ready. He loves the baby but feels it's not feasible. However, his main concern is about their readiness and financial situation. That's valid, but how he's handling it by pressuring her might be wrong. He's not considering her feelings or her potential desire to carry the child, even if it's hard. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both could share some blame. She didn't communicate her pill issues, and he didn't check in or suggest other precautions. But the key issue is his ultimatum, which could be seen as inconsiderate of her autonomy. He's making the decision for her, which is a big deal. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though their situation is difficult, pressuring her to have an abortion because of his personal readiness might make him at fault. The question is whether his actions are wrong. The answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy and making her decision based on his own limitations without considering her feelings and choices fully.\n"
