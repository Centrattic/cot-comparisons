Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She got pregnant, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Both are young, in university, and not in a stable financial position to have a child. The girl was on the pill, which is over 99% effective when taken correctly. However, she admitted to not taking it properly because of her vacation schedule. That's a key point. She knew the risks of not taking the pill correctly, so she's partially responsible for the pregnancy.\n\nBut then, the author is now asking her to have an abortion. He's saying that if she wants to keep the baby, he can't stay with her. He's giving her an ultimatum. Now, is that fair? Well, relationships are about mutual consent and shared decisions. The fact that he's 18 and she's 20, both still in school, adds to the context of their inexperience.\n\nHe's not taking responsibility for the situation. Even though she was on the pill, they were having sex without backup protection. So he should have considered the possibility, even if it's low. He's placing the blame on her for not taking the pill correctly. But in reality, both parties have a role in contraception. He didn't suggest using condoms or other methods when he knew she was on vacation and maybe not on her normal schedule. That's a missed opportunity for him to take initiative in preventing pregnancy.\n\nThen, when faced with the pregnancy, he's pressuring her to abort. She's open to keeping the baby, which indicates she might want to do so, but he's not considering her feelings or options. He's essentially telling her that if she doesn't abort, they can't be together. That's a lot of pressure and doesn't respect her autonomy. The decision to have an abortion should be hers to make, not a condition for their relationship continuing.\n\nHe also mentions that he's not ready for a child, which is valid, but the way he's handling it is problematic. An ultimatum like that can be emotionally coercive, especially given their age difference and the power dynamics in the relationship. He's not offering support or discussing options with her, just making a demand. That's not a healthy approach.\n\nFinancial stability is a factor, but the core issue is about respecting her choice and working together. Instead of giving her an ultimatum, he should have been part of the discussion about all possible options, including adoption or support if they wanted to keep the baby. By making it a dealbreaker for staying in the relationship, he's not sharing the responsibility but instead shifting it onto her.\n\nIn summary, while he's not entirely to blame for the pregnancy, his response is inappropriate. He's not taking shared responsibility, and his ultimatum is disrespectful of her autonomy and the complexity of her decision. So, the answer here would likely be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
