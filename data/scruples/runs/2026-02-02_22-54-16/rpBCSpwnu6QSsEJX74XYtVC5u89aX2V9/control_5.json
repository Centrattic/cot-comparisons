Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old male, and his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She's pregnant, and she's on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. He's upset because she didn't tell him she wasn't taking the pill properly during uni vacation. He asked her to have an abortion, and now he's worried about the consequences. The options are A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant individual. The author is suggesting she should abort, but it's her body and her choice. Even if they were both in a relationship, the final decision rests with her. So, pressuring her to abort against her will could be problematic.\n\nNext, the contraceptive use. He assumed she was taking the pill correctly, but she admitted she wasn't on schedule during vacation, leading to the pregnancy. The pill's effectiveness does drop if not taken consistently. However, the responsibility isn't solely on her. Contraception is a shared responsibility, and they could have used additional protection like condoms. He didn't mention using condoms, so maybe he's placing all the blame on her for not maintaining the pill regimen, which might not be fair. If he wanted to be safe, he could have used a condom as backup. But he didn't, so he might share some responsibility.\n\nHe tells her he can't stay with her if she has the baby. That's a heavy ultimatum. Even if he's not ready for a child, it's her choice whether to continue the pregnancy. By making her feel she has to abort to keep the relationship, he's imposing his decision on her. That's not fair. He's also offering to support her if she becomes a single mom, but the ultimatum is still there, which can be seen as controlling or dismissive of her autonomy.\n\nEmotionally, he's conflicted. He loves the baby but doesn't want to be a parent yet. He's also worried about the relationship. However, the way he's handling it might be causing more harm. The key here is that neither partner is solely at fault in terms of contraception, but the author's pressure on the abortion is a significant issue. It's about respecting her autonomy and choices regarding her own pregnancy.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend to make a decision about her body and the pregnancy, which is her right to decide. Even if there's shared responsibility in not using backup methods, his ultimatum is not his call to make. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
