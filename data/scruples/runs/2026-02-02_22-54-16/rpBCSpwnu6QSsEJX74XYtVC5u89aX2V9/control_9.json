Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She got pregnant even though she was on the pill. He's upset because he thought the pill was over 99% effective and assumes she was taking it properly. She says she wasn't taking it daily because of being on vacation and not on her normal schedule. He feels she should have told him they needed another method, like condoms. He then asks her to have an abortion, saying he can't handle a child right now and that it's not his fault if she didn't take the pill correctly.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, abortion decisions involve the pregnant person's autonomy. The guy can't force her to have one, but he's suggesting she must if they're to stay together. That seems problematic because her decision should be her own.\n\nHe blames her for not taking the pill properly, but maybe he should have checked in with her about contraception. He assumed she was on top of it, but maybe shared responsibility is important here. He's using financial arguments\u2014can't afford a baby\u2014but that's a common issue. However, his ultimatum that she must abort or he'll leave is a serious pressure tactic.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's not ready and can't support a child is valid, but making that a condition for staying in the relationship puts the burden on her. The emotional impact is huge; she's upset, and he's causing her distress. Even if he's conflicted, pushing for her to have an abortion against her wishes (since she's open to keeping the baby) is a big deal. He's making a decision that affects her body and future without her full consent.\n\nSo, in terms of ethical responsibility, he's being selfish by not considering her autonomy and making a choice that's beyond his control. Even if he's not ready, it's not her fault entirely, and he's not considering her perspective. So, the answer might be A\u2014yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
