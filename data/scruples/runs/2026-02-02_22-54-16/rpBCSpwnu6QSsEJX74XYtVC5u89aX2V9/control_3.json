Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy, who's 18, is dating a 20-year-old girlfriend. They've been together seven months. The girlfriend is pregnant, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for suggesting an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The girlfriend was on the pill, but she missed doses because she wasn't on her normal schedule during university vacation. The guy felt she should have used backup protection or told him they needed to stop having sex, which he thought was her responsibility. Then he told her he doesn't want the baby and said he can't stay with her if she keeps it. He's worried about their financial situation and not being ready for a child.\n\nNow, from a moral or ethical standpoint, this is a tough one. The girl is old enough to understand the risks of the pill and not taking it properly. But he's putting pressure on her to have an abortion because he's not ready. However, the key issue here is that the decision to have an abortion is ultimately the woman's. Even if both partners are involved, the final choice is hers. The guy is making it a condition for staying in the relationship, which could be seen as pressuring her into an abortion. That's a big red flag because it's not his decision to make, and he's using the relationship as leverage.\n\nAlso, considering their ages, 18 and 20, they're both very young. The guy is still in an apprenticeship and living with his parents. The girl is on student loans. They don't have the financial or emotional stability to support a child. But the fact that he's making the abortion a dealbreaker for staying with her might be where he's in the wrong. It's not fair to expect her to terminate the pregnancy just because he's not ready. Even if he feels it's her fault for missing the pill, he's still a parent if the child is born, so he's responsible in some way. But he's not holding himself accountable; instead, he's putting the entire burden on her.\n\nAnother point is the communication. He got angry that she didn't tell him about the risk, but maybe he should have checked in with her about her pill usage. They both have responsibilities in a sexual relationship regarding contraception. However, the fact that he's now pressuring her to have an abortion to stay with him is a major ethical issue. It's not his place to dictate her decision like that, especially in a way that uses their relationship as a bargaining chip.\n\nSo, even though he's in a difficult situation and not ready for a child, his approach is problematic. The right thing would be to support her decision, whether it's to keep the baby or have an abortion, without making it a condition for staying in the relationship. By tying his commitment to her choice, he's being manipulative and not respecting her autonomy. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
