Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (18M) asked his girlfriend (20F) to have an abortion after finding out she's pregnant. They've been dating seven months. She was on the pill but missed doses because of her vacation schedule. The author feels she should have used backup protection or told him they needed to stop having sex. He's not ready for a child, can't afford it, and made her choose between the baby or staying with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The key points here are consent, responsibility, and the decision-making in a relationship. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not ready for a child and they can't afford it. But does that give him the right to dictate her choice? In many places, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is ultimately up to the person carrying the child. The author didn't have the right to force her to abort. Even if he's not ready, it's her body and her decision. However, he's also stating his position and his willingness to support her if she wants to keep the baby. \n\nBut the problem is that he's making it a condition for staying in the relationship. That seems like it's pressuring her, which could be seen as manipulative. He's taking away her autonomy in the decision, which is a big issue. Even if he's not ready, he can't control her choice. So, while he's being honest about his feelings, the way he's framing the situation is problematic because it's not his decision to make. \n\nThe author also admits he feels tricked because she didn't tell him about missing the pill. But she did take responsibility by telling him. The argument here is whether it's her fault for missing the pill. The pill is effective when taken correctly, but she did make a mistake. However, the responsibility for contraception is usually shared in a relationship, and condoms could have been used as backup. The author might have a point in that he expected her to handle it properly, but he could have also suggested using a backup method without pressuring her to abort.\n\nIn terms of the relationship, making the decision to abort a condition for staying together crosses a line. It's not fair to the girlfriend, who might not have the same wishes. The author is prioritizing his own readiness over her potential wishes, even if she's open to keeping the baby. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in a tough spot, but by making the girlfriend choose between the baby or the relationship, he's imposing his will on her. That's where the \"wrong\" comes in. He's not wrong for not being ready, but he's wrong for pressuring her into an abortion and making it a deal-breaker. Therefore, the answer is A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
