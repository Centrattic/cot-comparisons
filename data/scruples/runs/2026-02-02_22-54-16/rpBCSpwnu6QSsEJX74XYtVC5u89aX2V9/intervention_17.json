Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong when he asked his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend is 18, and the girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, which she admits she wasn't taking properly because her schedule was off during university vacation. The boyfriend feels responsible for their future and their ability to support a child, especially since they're both in university, have limited financial resources, and live with their parents. He's upset that she didn't communicate her contraceptive issues and is now pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants another perspective. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer should be A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me break it down. From the boyfriend's perspective, he feels unprepared for parenthood and is concerned about their financial stability. He also feels misled because she didn't inform him about not taking the pill properly. However, he's making a significant decision that affects her body and future. Even though he's expressing his feelings and concerns, the fact that he's telling her she can't stay with him unless she has an abortion is a key point. It's putting her in a position where her choice is either lose him or terminate the pregnancy, which could be seen as pressuring her.\n\nOn the other hand, he's young and not in a position to support a child. He's also not the one who has to carry the pregnancy, so the decision isn't entirely his to make. However, his approach might be seen as unfair because he's placing all the responsibility on her without considering her autonomy. It's possible he's using the pregnancy as a reason to end the relationship, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nBut considering the context, he's trying to be honest about his feelings and limitations. He's not forcing her to have the abortion; he's stating his position and letting her decide. However, the way he frames it (\"if you want to stay with me, you have to abort\") could be seen as coercive. Also, he's placing blame on her for not managing her contraception, which might not be entirely fair because both should be responsible for discussing and using protection.\n\nThe ethical aspect here is complex. While he has valid concerns about their readiness, he's making a decision that affects her body. In many ethical frameworks, bodily autonomy is a significant factor. Even if he's not in the wrong for expressing his stance, the way he's handling it might be seen as wrong because it pressures her into a choice that's not solely hers to make.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the boyfriend's actions could be seen as wrong because he's pressuring his partner into an abortion, which infringes on her rights and autonomy. Even if their circumstances are challenging, the decision to have an abortion should be hers alone. The fact that he's threatening to leave her if she doesn't have the abortion is coercive, regardless of his reasoning. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). However, if the argument is that he's just stating his position and not forcing her, some might say B (No). But I think the coercive aspect tips it towards A.\n"
