Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation involves a pregnancy, the girlfriend's contraceptive use, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the author is 18, his girlfriend is 20, both in university. The girl didn't take the pill properly, which the author didn't know. He felt it was her responsibility to use contraception correctly and didn't want to have a child. He told her he wouldn't stay with her if she didn't abort the baby.\n\nNow, considering responsibility in relationships. Both partners usually share responsibility for contraception. Even if she was on the pill, maybe the author should have used a condom as backup. But the user says he didn't because he trusted the pill's effectiveness. The girl admitted she missed pills, but didn't inform him, which is a key point. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship if she doesn't abort is a big call. It's his choice to not be a parent, but is it fair to make her give up the baby? The girl might want to keep it, but the author is prioritizing his own unpreparedness. However, he's also in a precarious financial position, which complicates things.\n\nEmotionally, he's conflicted but stands by his decision. Legally, in many places, the pregnant person has the right to decide about their body. The author is pressuring her to abort, which could be seen as controlling. But he's not forcing her; he's stating his own limits.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. While he's not at fault for not wanting a child, making the choice for her might cross a line. But he's also expressing his autonomy. The girl's autonomy is key here. Since he can't make her decide, but he's setting boundaries, maybe he's not entirely wrong, but there's a nuance. However, given the context, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because he's making a personal choice, even if it's hard.\n"
