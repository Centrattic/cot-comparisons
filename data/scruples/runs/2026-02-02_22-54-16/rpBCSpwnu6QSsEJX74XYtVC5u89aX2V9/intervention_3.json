Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. The boyfriend, who's 18, is asking if he's at fault for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is 20 and they've been dating seven months. She's on the pill but missed doses during her university vacation. The boyfriend feels she should have communicated about the risk of pregnancy and used backup contraception. He then tells her he wants an abortion and that he can't stay with her if she doesn't get one. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this objectively.\n\nContraception responsibility: The pill's effectiveness is around 99%, but that's with perfect use. The girlfriend admitted to missing doses. However, it's important to note that no method is 100% foolproof. The boyfriend might feel responsible, but the reality is that the pill's effectiveness can drop with inconsistent use. But is it fair for him to place all the blame on her?\n\nCommunication: The girlfriend didn't inform him about missing the pill, which is a big oversight. However, the boyfriend expected her to take the pill properly without backup. Did he ever discuss contraception methods with her? Maybe they didn't have open communication about their responsibilities regarding birth control. If the pill was her method, then the primary responsibility lies with her, but the boyfriend could have suggested using condoms as a backup, even if she was on the pill. \n\nThe boyfriend's response: He's in an apprenticeship, lives with his parents, and they both have limited financial resources. He's not ready for a child, which is understandable. But by pressuring her to have an abortion and making it a condition for staying in the relationship, is that fair? The girlfriend is considering keeping the baby, and he's essentially telling her that if she does, he won't be part of the child's life. That could be seen as coercive, even if he's not forcing her physically. The decision to have an abortion is a major one, and the woman has the autonomy to make that choice. By making it a deal-breaker, he's imposing his wishes on her, which may not be right.\n\nEmotional impact: The situation is causing significant stress on their relationship. The boyfriend feels conflicted, loving both his girlfriend and the potential child but not being ready. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening to leave unless she has an abortion\u2014might be considered wrong because it's pressuring her to make a life-altering decision. Even if he's not forcing her, making it conditional on their relationship could be seen as manipulative.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: Depending on the country, the legality of abortion varies, but assuming it's legal, the girlfriend should have the right to decide. However, the boyfriend's insistence that she must abort for them to stay together is problematic. It's her body, and he shouldn't be dictating that choice, even if he has valid concerns about their readiness.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The boyfriend has valid concerns about their financial and emotional readiness, but his approach is flawed. By placing all the blame on her for missing the pill and then making the abortion a non-negotiable condition, he's not handling the situation responsibly. He should have discussed the possibility of backup methods earlier, and his ultimatum might be seen as wrong because it's pressuring her decision. The girlfriend also has responsibilities in taking her pill correctly and communicating the risks, but the boyfriend's response crosses a line by making it a deal-breaker for their relationship.\n"
