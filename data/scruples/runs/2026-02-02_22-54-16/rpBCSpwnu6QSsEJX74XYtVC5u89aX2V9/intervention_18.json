Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is complex, so I need to consider both perspectives.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20 and pregnant. She's on the pill, but missed some doses because of her schedule. The author is 18, both are in university, and they can't support a child. The author feels she should have communicated better about the contraception. He's not ready for a child and offers to help financially if she chooses to keep it but insists she must abort to stay together. \n\nFrom the author's side, he's young and in a tough financial spot. He's trying to make a decision based on their circumstances. However, pressuring someone into an abortion, especially when she's open to keeping the baby, might be seen as controlling. The girlfriend didn't mention not taking the pill properly until after the pregnancy was discovered, which the author feels was a breach of communication. But did he check in on her pill use before? Maybe not. The author's ultimatum\u2014either abort or break up\u2014could be seen as manipulative. Even if he's not ready, making the decision for her isn't fair. The right to choose what to do with her body is significant here. So while the author has valid concerns about their readiness, his approach may be the issue. The answer might hinge on whether the decision should be mutual versus one person imposing their will.\n"
