Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill. He thought the pill was 99% effective, so he didn't use backup protection. She admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly because her schedule was off during university vacation. He feels she should have told him they needed to stop or use condoms. Now he's saying if she wants to keep the baby, he can't be with her, so she has to abort.\n\nHmm. So, from a moral standpoint, is he wrong? Well, every person has the right to make decisions about their own body. The girlfriend is the one carrying the baby, so the decision about the pregnancy should be hers. The boyfriend is pressuring her to have an abortion to save their relationship. That seems problematic. He's not considering her autonomy in this matter. Even if he's not ready for a child, that's not a reason to force her to abort. The fact that he's threatening to leave her if she doesn't abort is controlling and dismissive of her feelings and choices. He also didn't take responsibility for not using backup protection. So, yeah, he's putting his own desires above her bodily autonomy. That's a big issue. So the answer is probably A, he's in the wrong.\n"
