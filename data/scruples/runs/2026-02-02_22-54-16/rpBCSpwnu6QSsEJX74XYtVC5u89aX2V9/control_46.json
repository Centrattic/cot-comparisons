Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong in this situation where he asked his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill. The author feels she should have told him they needed backup protection because she wasn't taking the pill properly due to her schedule during university vacation. He thinks she's old enough to know the risks and feels tricked because she didn't inform him. Then, he told her he doesn't want the baby and said he can't stay with her if she keeps it, offering financial support if she wants to be a single mom but insisting on an abortion to stay together.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The girlfriend is on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she wasn't taking it properly. The author didn't use backup protection, assuming she was on the pill. So, he shares some responsibility in the sense that he didn't take additional precautions. However, the pill's effectiveness is based on correct usage. If she missed doses, that's her responsibility. But maybe the author could have asked if she was taking it correctly or used a condom as a backup. The fact that he didn't do that might mean he's partially responsible.\n\nThen, when the pregnancy happens, the author is making a decision about the abortion. Here, the girlfriend is the one who would undergo the procedure. The author is pressuring her to make a choice that affects her body and future. Even if he's not ready for a child, the decision about terminating a pregnancy is ethically and legally hers to make, not his. So by forcing her to choose between abortion or losing him, he's not respecting her autonomy. That's a significant point. In many places, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own pregnancy, and the partner shouldn't dictate that choice.\n\nAlso, the author's response seems to be more about his own readiness and resources rather than considering her feelings and her ability to handle a pregnancy. While they both have limited resources, he's making a unilateral decision that doesn't account for her desires or her capacity. The girlfriend mentioned she's open to keeping the baby but isn't clear if she wants to. The author's ultimatum could be seen as emotional coercion, using the relationship as leverage to influence her decision.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is in a position where he's not in the wrong for not being ready, but he is in the wrong for pressuring her to make a decision that's entirely her own. The key issue here is respecting her autonomy. Even if he's not at fault for the pregnancy (depending on whether he could have done more to prevent it), he's wrong for controlling her reproductive choices. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
