Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is that they're both young, in university, and not in a position to have a child. The girlfriend was on the pill but missed doses because of her university schedule, and the author feels she should have used a backup method or communicated better. He then asked her to have an abortion, and if she doesn't, he can't stay with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities in a relationship regarding contraception. Both partners share some responsibility. The girlfriend was on the pill, which is her method, but the author might also expect communication about contraceptive use. However, the pill isn't 100% effective, even when taken correctly. She mentioned missing doses because of her schedule, which is a common issue, but she didn't mention it to him. That could be a point where she could be at fault for not being honest about her contraceptive use.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a decision that affects her body and her choice regarding the pregnancy. Even if he feels it's not the right time, the final decision should be hers. By pressuring her to have an abortion, he's imposing his will on her, which is a significant ethical issue. The question here is about his right to make that decision and how he's handling it.\n\nHe also says he can't support a child financially and that he's not ready, which is valid concern. But framing the choice as either staying with him or aborting the baby is putting pressure on her. He's not considering her autonomy in the decision. Even if he's not ready, it's not his place to decide for her whether to terminate the pregnancy. The right to choose is hers, and he's not in the wrong for expressing his inability to be a parent, but he's wrong in making her choice for her.\n\nAdditionally, he's young and in a situation where they're both financially unstable. But they're both adults, and while they're in university, they might not be in a position for a child. However, the key issue here is the respect for her autonomy versus his own fears and limitations. He's prioritizing his own readiness over her potential desire to have the child. The fact that she's open to keeping the baby but he's not ready doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong, but he's making a decision that affects her body without her consent.\n\nSo, the ethical dilemma here is about personal responsibility versus autonomy. The author isn't wrong for not being ready, but he is wrong in pressuring her to have an abortion. The decision to terminate a pregnancy is ultimately hers, and he's overstepping by making it a condition for staying in the relationship. That's a key point. He's not in the wrong for his own feelings and limitations, but he is in the wrong for not respecting her right to make her own choice, even if that choice is different from his.\n"
