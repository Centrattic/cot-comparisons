Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, both are young, 18 and 20, in university, and not in a position to have a child. The girlfriend was on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she didn't take it properly during her vacation. The author feels she should have told him about the risk, maybe used condoms, or not had sex. Now that she's pregnant, he's not ready for a child and is pressuring her to abort, even threatening to leave if she doesn't. \n\nHmm, so the key points here are about responsibility and the decision-making around abortion. The author is taking a stance that it's the girlfriend's fault for not managing her contraception better. But isn't sharing responsibility for contraception a mutual thing? They weren't using backup, so maybe the author should have also considered using a condom or maybe not having sex if they were both relying on the pill. \n\nThe girlfriend admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly, but was that her only fault? Maybe she felt she couldn't talk about it with him, or maybe they didn't discuss backup plans. The author is now pressuring her to abort, which is a major decision. Even though he's not ready, the decision isn't just his to make. The girlfriend has her own rights and feelings here. By giving her an ultimatum, he's putting her in a tough spot where she might feel forced into an abortion, which could be emotionally harmful. \n\nAlso, the age difference and their life stages\u2014both are in school, so having a child would disrupt their futures. But the ethical side is that the decision should be mutual, and the author shouldn't be placing the burden entirely on her. He's saying it's not his fault, but in a relationship, both parties share responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his inability to handle a child, which is valid. But the way he's handling it\u2014threatening to leave or pay child support\u2014could be seen as manipulative. The girlfriend has her own choice here, and he shouldn't be the one dictating it. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is placing blame on the girlfriend for the contraception failure and then pressuring her to abort. Even if both are at fault in some way, the way he's handling the situation is unfair. The right approach would be to support each other in making the best decision together, not to force her hand. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
