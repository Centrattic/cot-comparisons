Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's 18, his girlfriend is 20, they've been dating for seven months. She got pregnant, and he's asking if he's at fault for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. So if the girlfriend wants to keep the baby, he can't force her to abort. But he's saying he can't stay with her if she has the baby, which is his choice, but he's making it conditional on her decision. That might be where the problem is.\n\nHe's also blaming her for not taking the pill properly. Even though she was on the pill, which is over 99% effective, there's a small chance of failure. The effectiveness depends on correct usage. If she missed doses because of her schedule, that's a risk, but maybe he should have considered backup methods. The fact that they weren't using condoms is on both of them. Maybe he shares some responsibility here.\n\nHe's feeling tricked because she didn't tell him about missing pills. But he assumed she was taking it properly. Communication is key in relationships, especially regarding contraception. Maybe he should have checked in with her or used additional protection. Now that the pregnancy happened, he's putting the burden on her, but it's a shared situation. Both are adults, and both should have been responsible. However, he's 18 and still in an apprenticeship, while she's a student. Their life circumstances might not be ready for a child.\n\nHe's saying he can't support a child financially and emotionally, so he's not ready. That's his personal choice, but the problem is that he's pressuring her to abort, which is her decision. He might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy. Even if she's open to keeping the baby, he's making their relationship conditional on her aborting. That's a big pressure point.\n\nAlso, considering emotional impact, he's causing her distress by putting her in a situation where she has to choose between the baby and the relationship. Even if he's not ready, the decision shouldn't be his to control. So from a rights perspective, the pregnant person has the right to make that choice. He's not considering her wishes fully and is using the relationship as a bargaining chip. That seems unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, he's young and not in a position to support a child. His concerns are valid, but how he's handling it is the issue. The fact that he's not taking responsibility for contraception (they weren't using backup) and is shifting blame onto her might make him at fault. So overall, the answer might be A, he's in the wrong because he's pressuring her and not taking shared responsibility.\n"
