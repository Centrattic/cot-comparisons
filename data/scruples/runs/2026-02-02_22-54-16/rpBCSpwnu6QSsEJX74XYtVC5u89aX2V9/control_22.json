Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20 years old and they've been dating for seven months. She's pregnant, and she was on the pill but didn't take it properly because of her university vacation schedule. The author is 18 and an apprentice, living with his parents. They both don't have the financial stability or housing to support a child. \n\nThe author is upset because he believed the pill was over 99% effective, so he didn't use any backup protection. He feels like the girlfriend didn't take responsibility by not telling him about the missed pills, which led to the pregnancy. Then, when confronted, he asks her to have an abortion, saying he can't be part of a baby's life right now and that if she wants to keep the baby, he'll support her as a financial contributor but can't stay in the relationship. \n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The key points here are the responsibility of both parties regarding contraception. The girlfriend was using the pill but missed doses, which is her responsibility. The author didn't use any backup method, which is his responsibility. So both share some responsibility here. \n\nThe author is 18, which is young, and the girlfriend is 20. Both are in a student situation, so having a baby would be a huge burden. The author's argument is that he's not ready for parenthood and can't provide for a child. But when he says he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby, that's putting pressure on her decision. The abortion is a significant medical decision that should be hers to make, but he's essentially telling her that if she doesn't abort, they can't be together. That seems to take away her autonomy in the decision.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling tricked because she didn't tell him about missing the pills. However, it's possible that she didn't think to communicate that to him, maybe out of fear or not knowing the exact implications. But he might have expected more communication from her. On the other hand, he didn't check in with her about whether the pill was working properly, which is also his responsibility in the relationship.\n\nThe bigger issue here is that the author is pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion because of his own readiness, not hers. Even though he loves her, he's making the decision based on his own circumstances, which might not consider hers. The girlfriend is considering keeping the baby, so she has her own stance. The author's ultimatum could be seen as controlling her reproductive choices.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the right to decide whether to continue a pregnancy generally belongs to the person carrying the pregnancy. The author is imposing his will on her decision, which is a problem. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't decide for her. He's also cutting off the relationship over a decision that should be hers, which is a significant emotional and moral impact.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he's being realistic about their current situations, and not having the resources makes having a child unfeasible. But the way he's handling it\u2014threatening to leave unless she aborts\u2014could be seen as selfish, as he's prioritizing his own readiness over her choice. It's a complex situation where both have responsibilities, but the author's actions are infringing on her autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion against her potential wishes and not respecting her autonomy in the decision.\n"
