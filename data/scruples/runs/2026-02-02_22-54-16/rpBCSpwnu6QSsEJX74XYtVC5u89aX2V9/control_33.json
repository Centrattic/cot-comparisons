Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is that they're both young, in university, and not in a place to have a baby. The girlfriend was on the pill but missed doses during vacation, leading to pregnancy. The author feels she should have used backup methods or told him they needed to stop having sex. Now he's telling her he can't be part of the baby's life unless she aborts it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of both parties. The girl was on the pill, which is her method of contraception. The author might have expected her to manage it properly, but he didn't use a condom or check if she was on it consistently. So maybe he shares some responsibility. Then there's the aspect of autonomy. The girlfriend has the right to make decisions about her own body. The author is essentially pressuring her to have an abortion to keep their relationship, which could be seen as coercive.\n\nAlso, the age factor. They're both under 20, and dealing with an unplanned pregnancy at their age is a huge burden. The author is not in a position financially to support a child. But is it fair for him to force her to abort? The girlfriend is open to keeping the baby, but he's making it a condition for staying with her. That's putting a lot of pressure on her decision.\n\nAbortion is a personal choice. Even if the author feels it's the right choice for them, he can't make that decision for her. However, he's also stating that he can't handle being a parent right now, which is his honest feeling. But is it his place to dictate her choice? The key point here is consent and mutual decision-making. They need to decide together, but the author is not allowing her to choose to keep the baby if she wants to. Instead, he's making her choice dependent on their relationship.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical perspectives, the girlfriend has the right to choose, and the author shouldn't be coercing her. Even if he feels it's the responsible choice, he can't force her. So, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring her to make a decision that affects her body and her future, not allowing her autonomy. He should support her choice, whatever it is, instead of making it a deal-breaker for their relationship.\n"
