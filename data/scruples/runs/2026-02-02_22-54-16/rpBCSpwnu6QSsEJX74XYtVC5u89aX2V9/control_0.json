Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a young couple, both in university, facing an unexpected pregnancy. The man is 18, the girlfriend 20. They've been dating seven months and weren't using backup contraception because she was on the pill. Now she's pregnant, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, abortion is legal, but the decision usually rests with the woman. The man doesn't have legal authority over her body, so pressuring her could be problematic. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so the answer would depend on whether his actions were coercive or not.\n\nLooking at the details: The man feels betrayed because she didn't tell him about missing her pill. He then tells her he can't stay with her if she has the baby and says if she wants to keep it, she must abort. That sounds like he's trying to control her decision. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't force her to abort. The woman has the right to make her own choice, and pressuring her to do something against her will is wrong. Also, the fact that she's open to keeping the baby but he's not considering her wishes shows a lack of mutual decision-making.\n\nAnother angle: They're both young and might not be in a financial or emotional position for a child. But that doesn't give him the right to dictate her medical decisions. The man's approach seems to be putting pressure on her to abort to save their relationship, which is a form of emotional manipulation. Even if his intentions are based on their current circumstances, he's not respecting her autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, he's expressing his own unpreparedness and the potential impact on their relationship. But he should have discussed this with her to find a mutual solution rather than making it an ultimatum. The key here is that the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is the woman's, and he's overstepping by making it conditional on their relationship.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's pressuring her to abort, which is her decision to make, and using the relationship as leverage is inappropriate.\n"
