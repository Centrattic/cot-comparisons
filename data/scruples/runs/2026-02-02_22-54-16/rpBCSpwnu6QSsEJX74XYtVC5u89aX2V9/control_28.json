Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The girl is 20, he's 18. They've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, but she admitted she didn't take it properly because of her schedule. He feels she should have used backup or told him they needed to stop having sex. He mentions she knew the risks. \n\nHe's not ready for a baby, can't afford it, and is in an apprenticeship. When she tells him about the pregnancy, he's shocked. Later, he tells her he doesn't want the baby and says if she wants to keep it, he can't stay with her. He offers financial support if she's a single mom but insists on an abortion to stay together. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The key issue is whether he's in the wrong for pressuring her to abort. The girl is open to keeping the baby, but it's unclear if she wants it. He's making a decision that affects her body and her future. Even if he's not ready, the decision to have an abortion is ultimately hers. By making it a condition of their relationship, he's placing a lot of pressure on her. \n\nAlso, he criticized her for not handling contraception properly, which might imply he's placing blame on her. But he's also young and in a fragile financial situation. However, the right to make decisions about one's own reproduction is a big factor here. If he's not supporting her choice to keep the baby, even if he's not ready, that could be seen as wrong. \n\nAnother angle: he's trying to protect his future, but she's the one carrying the child. The question is about his responsibility versus her autonomy. In many ethical discussions, a person cannot force someone else to have an abortion. So by making it a deal-breaker, he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring her into a decision that's primarily her right to make. Even if he's not ready, the decision should be hers. He's also placing blame on her for the contraception failure, which might not be fair, but the main issue is the ultimatum he gave her.\n"
