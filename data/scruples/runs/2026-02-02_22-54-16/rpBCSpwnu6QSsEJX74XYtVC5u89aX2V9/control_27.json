Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the girl is 20, the guy is 18. They've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and he's shocked because she was on the pill. He feels she should have been responsible with the pill and not made excuses. He wants an abortion because they can't handle a baby financially and emotionally. But he's also making her choose between him and the baby, which is a big deal.\n\nFrom what I know, in many places, abortion is a woman's choice, and the partner doesn't have the right to dictate that decision. The guy is putting pressure on her, which could be emotional manipulation. Even if he's not ready for a child, it's her body and her decision. He's also suggesting he'll support her financially if she does it alone, but that might not be enough. The fact that he's 18 and still in an apprenticeship might affect his judgment, as he's young and not fully independent yet.\n\nHe didn't use backup protection, relying solely on the pill, which is her responsibility. But he's angry that she didn't communicate her issues with the pill. She did tell him she was struggling, but he felt it wasn't an excuse. Maybe he should have been more understanding or used a condom. His main argument is that he's not ready, but forcing her to abort because of his circumstances is problematic. \n\nAlso, the girl is open to keeping the baby, so his ultimatum is forcing her into a decision that affects her. Even if he loves her, making a choice that removes her autonomy is wrong. The legal aspect aside, ethically, it's her choice. So, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring her and not respecting her autonomy.\n"
