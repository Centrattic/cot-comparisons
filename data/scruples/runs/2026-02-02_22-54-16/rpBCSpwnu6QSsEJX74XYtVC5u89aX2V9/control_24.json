Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20, they've been dating seven months. She gets pregnant, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, both partners have rights regarding pregnancy decisions, but the woman has the final say on whether to continue the pregnancy. So, if the woman wants to keep the baby and the man wants an abortion, he can't force her to have one. Conversely, if she's open to abortion but not certain, maybe he can have input, but it's her decision ultimately.\n\nThe guy is upset because he thinks she should have used backup contraception since she wasn't on her normal schedule. He expects her to take responsibility because she's on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. But he's placing the blame on her for not managing her pill properly. Maybe he should have also considered using a backup method like condoms, even if she's on the pill. Condoms are a form of protection that both parties can contribute to, so maybe he's not entirely without fault here.\n\nHe's also financially not in a position to support a child, which is understandable. He's in an apprenticeship, lives with parents, she's a student. They both don't have the resources. But when the situation arises, he's making it conditional on her having an abortion if she wants to stay with him. That seems harsh. Relationships can be complicated, but he's essentially saying he can't stay with her if she wants to keep the baby. That might be a heavy burden to place on her, especially if she's not sure what she wants. \n\nHe mentions she hinted she wants the baby, but he's not sure. He's giving her an ultimatum, which could be seen as pressuring her. Even if he's not ready, he's not in a position to make her have an abortion. The decision should be hers, and his response might be controlling or not respecting her autonomy. \n\nAlso, he's saying he feels tricked because she didn't tell him about the missed pills. But maybe she didn't want to bring up the possibility of pregnancy before it happened. Communication in relationships is key, but expecting her to have told him she might be at risk might be reasonable, but it's a two-way street. They should have discussed contraception more thoroughly. He might have shared the responsibility by using a backup method too.\n\nSo, considering all that, the guy is in a difficult situation. However, his actions of pressuring her to have an abortion and making her choice about her own body contingent on staying in the relationship might be the issue. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't force her to terminate. The final decision rests with her, and his ultimatum could be seen as wrong. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy in the decision-making process.\n"
