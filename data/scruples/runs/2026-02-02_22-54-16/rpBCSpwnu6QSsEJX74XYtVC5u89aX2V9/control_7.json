Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20, they've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. She admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly because of her schedule during uni vacation. He feels she should have used backup protection or told him they needed to stop having sex. He then confronts her about the pregnancy, and when she's open to keeping the baby, he says he doesn't want the baby and threatens to leave if she doesn't abort. He also mentions he can't support a child financially and doesn't want to be involved.\n\nFirst, the legal age of consent here is probably okay since they're both over 18. But the main issue is whether he's in the wrong for pressuring her into an abortion. Let me consider the key points.\n\n1. **Contraception Responsibility**: He expected her to take the pill properly. But contraception is a shared responsibility. Even if she's on the pill, both partners should discuss and ensure proper use. However, she admitted missing doses because of her schedule. He might feel she was negligent, but is that his fault? Maybe he should have asked if she was taking it consistently or offered other methods.\n\n2. **Communication**: He was shocked because he thought the pill was reliable. But maybe he didn't check in with her about her pill use. If she was struggling with her schedule, perhaps she should have communicated that earlier. But he also didn't ask. Both could have been more proactive in discussing their contraceptive methods.\n\n3. **Decision-Making**: He's making a decision about her body. Even though he's involved, the final decision on abortion is hers. By pressuring her to abort, is he taking away her autonomy? That's a big ethical issue. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't force her to terminate the pregnancy. The fact that he's threatening to leave if she doesn't abort could be seen as emotional coercion.\n\n4. **Emotional Impact**: He acknowledges feeling like an asshole but still stands by his decision. This shows he's aware of the emotional toll but isn't backing down. The girlfriend is upset and might feel pressured, which is not healthy in a relationship.\n\n5. **Financial and Readiness**: They both have financial issues, so not being ready is valid. However, the decision to abort is hers. His stance could be selfish, but it's also a personal choice. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening to leave or pay as a \"dick move\"\u2014might be inappropriate.\n\n6. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: In many places, a partner can't force an abortion on another. Even if both agree initially, the way he's handling it could be seen as wrong because he's not respecting her potential autonomy. If she's open to keeping the baby, he's dismissing her choice and imposing his own.\n\n7. **Maturity and Relationship Dynamics**: At 18 and 20, they're both young and might not have handled this situation maturely. However, the key issue is the pressure he's putting on her. Even if he feels it's not his fault, pressuring a partner into a medical decision is problematic.\n\nPutting it all together, the main ethical issue is the pressure on her to abort. While his concerns about readiness and finances are valid, he can't make the decision for her. The fact that he's using the threat of leaving or financial support as leverage shows he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy in a major decision about her body. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's pressuring her into a choice that should be hers alone.\n"
