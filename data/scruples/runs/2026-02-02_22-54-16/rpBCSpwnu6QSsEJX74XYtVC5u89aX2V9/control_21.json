Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months and aren't in a position financially or otherwise to have a child. The girlfriend was on the pill but stopped taking it properly during university vacation, leading to pregnancy. The author feels it's her responsibility because she didn't use backup contraception or inform him, and he's not ready for a child, so he tells her he can't stay with her if she doesn't abort.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right. The author is trying to control her choice, which can be seen as violating her autonomy. Even if he's not in a position to support a child, the decision should be hers. The fact that he's pressuring her to abort for his own reasons, regardless of his situation, might be the key point here. Also, he's young and perhaps not fully considering the emotional impact on her.\n\nOn the other hand, he's in a difficult financial position and isn't ready for parenthood. He's trying to be honest about his limitations. But the main issue is whether he's in the wrong for imposing his decision on her. Even if he's not financially stable, the choice is not his to make. The argument that she should have been more responsible is a common one, but it doesn't take away his responsibility to support her decision, even if it's not the one he prefers.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is pressuring his girlfriend to make a decision that's not his to make. That's where the ethical issue lies. Therefore, the answer is likely Yes (A).\n"
