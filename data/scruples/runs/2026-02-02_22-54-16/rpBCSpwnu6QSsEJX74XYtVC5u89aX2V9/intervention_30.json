Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is an 18-year-old guy who's been dating his 20-year-old girlfriend for seven months. She got pregnant, and she's on the pill. He thought she was taking it properly because the pill is over 99% effective. But she told him she's been missing doses because she's not on her normal schedule during university vacation. He feels she should have used a backup method like condoms or stopped having sex if she couldn't take the pill correctly. He's upset because she didn't tell him about the risk and now he's asking her to have an abortion, threatening to leave her if she doesn't. He's not ready for a baby, can't afford it, and doesn't have the resources. The girlfriend is open to keeping the baby but isn't sure. They fight, and he tells her he can't stay with her if she has the baby. He's torn but insists on the abortion because he can't handle the situation.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is making a very significant decision that affects his partner. The girlfriend is the one who is pregnant, so she has the right to make the final decision about her body. The author is pressuring her to have an abortion, which could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's not ready for a baby, the pregnancy is her body, and he doesn't get to make that choice for her. He's also placing blame on her for the situation, which might not be fair because even with the pill, there's a small chance of failure, and missing a dose can happen even if someone is trying their best.\n\nOn the other hand, he's young, in an apprenticeship, and they both have limited resources. He's under a lot of stress and pressure, and his concern about being able to provide for a child is valid. However, the way he's handling it\u2014telling her she has to abort or he'll leave her\u2014could be seen as manipulative or not giving her agency. It's important to note that in many places, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right, and the partner can't force that choice. Additionally, he's not taking responsibility for the situation; instead, he's blaming her for not taking the pill correctly, which might not be entirely her fault if the pill isn't 100% effective or if there were other factors.\n\nThe author could have approached the situation differently, like discussing both options together, supporting each other, and seeking counseling or support from professionals. By making an ultimatum, he's not showing the support and partnership that might be needed in such a difficult time. His actions could lead to the end of the relationship regardless of the outcome, which shows a lack of commitment to working through the problem together.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his partner to make a decision about her body without respecting her autonomy, placing blame, and not taking shared responsibility for the situation. Even if his intentions are about not being ready for a child, the way he's handling it is inappropriate and disrespectful.\n"
