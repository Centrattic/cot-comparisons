Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the guy is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. He's 18, and his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She's pregnant, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for asking her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, he mentions she was on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she admits she didn't take it properly because her schedule was off during university vacation. He feels she should have used backup like condoms or told him they needed to stop having sex. She didn't, so he feels \"tricked.\" Then he tells her he doesn't want the baby and that he can't stay with her if she chooses to keep it, offering child support if she wants to be a single mom.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here might be about responsibility, communication, and the right to make decisions about one's own body.\n\nHe's blaming her for not taking the pill properly, which she admitted, and he's holding her responsible for the contraception. But in a relationship, typically both partners share responsibility for contraception. If he trusted the pill to work because she was on it, maybe he should have used a condom as backup. Also, maybe he should have checked in with her about her pill use, but that's a lot to expect in a young relationship.\n\nThen, when she gets pregnant, he's saying he's not ready and doesn't want the baby. But he's making a ultimatum: abortion or no relationship. That's a huge pressure, especially considering her autonomy. Even if he's not ready, the decision to have an abortion is hers as the mother. He can't force her to have one, and pressuring her like that could be seen as controlling or not respecting her agency.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's using this as a reason to end the relationship if she doesn't abort might add emotional manipulation. He's saying it's not his fault because she didn't handle contraception properly, but in reality, both share responsibility. Plus, he's 18 and still living with his parents, so maybe he's not in a position to make such a big decision either.\n\nOn the other hand, he's young and in an apprenticeship, so financially they can't support a child. That part is understandable. But the way he's handling it\u2014threatening to cut her off emotionally unless she aborts\u2014is probably the problematic part. He's not considering her feelings and her right to decide what to do with her body. Even if he feels responsible, the pressure he's putting on her is not fair.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The main issue is his ultimatum and not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's not ready for a child, the decision to abort should be hers. Pressuring her for not handling contraception properly and making it a deal-breaker if she doesn't abort is not right. He's taking away her agency in a situation where she's already vulnerable. So the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
