Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is that they're both young, in university, not in a position to have a baby. The girlfriend was on the pill but missed doses, leading to pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels the responsibility for not using backup protection is on his girlfriend since she didn't take the pill properly. He's not ready for a child and can't financially support a baby. He's asking her to have an abortion to keep the relationship. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel pressured and that the decision isn't entirely hers.\n\nThe key points here are consent and autonomy. The author is making a decision that affects her body. Even if she's open to keeping the baby, the author is essentially pressuring her to abort. It's her right to decide what happens with her body. By giving her an ultimatum, he's not respecting her autonomy. Also, the fact that she didn't use backup protection is a shared responsibility. They both could have used condoms. The author's anger about her not taking the pill properly might be overshadowing his own part in not using additional protection.\n\nAnother aspect is the emotional impact. He's causing her distress by making her choose between the baby and the relationship. It's a very personal and difficult decision. Even if he's not ready, the choice shouldn't be his to make for her. He's in a position of power in the relationship, and pressuring her in this way can be harmful. The fact that he's offering financial support if she chooses to be a single mom might not be sufficient, as emotional support is also crucial.\n\nSo, even though both are unprepared, the author is imposing his decision on her, which is a violation of her bodily autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong.\n"
