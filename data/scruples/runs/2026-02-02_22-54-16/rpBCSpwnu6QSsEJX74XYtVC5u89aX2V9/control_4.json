Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the guy is 18, and his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She got pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill but missed doses during university vacation. He feels she should have used backup protection or stopped having sex. He's not ready for a baby, can't afford it, and lives with his parents. The woman is open to keeping the baby but doesn't commit. He tells her he doesn't want the baby and can't stay with her if she keeps it. Then he says he'll support her financially if she wants to be a single mom but if she wants to stay with him, she must abort. She's upset, and he feels like an asshole but is firm.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. To figure this out, I need to consider a few angles: the use of coercion in decisions about pregnancy, the legal and ethical aspects of such decisions, and the responsibilities of both parties in a relationship regarding contraception.\n\nFirst, in many places, the decision to have an abortion is primarily the woman's. While partners can discuss and support each other's decisions, pressuring or making it a condition for staying in the relationship could be seen as manipulative or controlling. The man is essentially saying that if she wants to keep the baby, he'll leave her, which could be a form of emotional coercion. That's a red flag.\n\nThen there's the issue of contraception. The woman was on the pill but missed doses. The man expected her to take it properly but didn't use backup. It's true that the pill is over 99% effective when used correctly, but that's under perfect use. Typical use is lower because of missed pills. He might feel she's at fault, but it's a shared responsibility. Maybe he should have used a condom as backup, especially if she's on a schedule that might make taking the pill difficult. However, the woman did mention her schedule was off, so maybe she was honest about the risk. But he didn't take her concerns seriously and now is holding it against her.\n\nAnother angle: the financial and emotional readiness. They are both young, in school, and not in a position to have a child. His concerns are valid, but the way he's handling it is problematic. By making her choice to keep the baby a deal-breaker, he's not supporting her in this life-changing decision. Instead, he's imposing his own desires without fully considering her autonomy and well-being. Even if he loves her, pressuring her to abort could be harmful, especially if she might have wanted to keep the baby but now feels forced into an abortion due to his ultimatum.\n\nAlso, from an ethical standpoint, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is deeply personal and should be made by the person carrying the pregnancy. The man's approach seems to disregard her autonomy and is more about his own readiness rather than respecting her choice. Even if he feels it's her fault for missing pills, that's not a justification for pressuring her into an abortion. They could have explored other options, like adoption or support systems, but he's not even considering that; he's just giving her an ultimatum.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the man's concerns about their unpreparedness are understandable, his actions are ethically wrong. He's not in a position to make that decision for her, and using the relationship as a bargaining chip is manipulative. The key issue here is the lack of mutual support and the coercion involved in the decision-making process regarding her body and future.\n"
