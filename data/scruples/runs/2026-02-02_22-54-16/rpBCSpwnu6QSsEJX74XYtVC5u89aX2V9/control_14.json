Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant, and the guy is asking her to have an abortion. They're both in university, not financially stable, and he feels she didn't handle contraception properly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Depending on the country, abortion laws vary. But since the user didn't specify, maybe I should focus more on the moral and ethical aspects here. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nThe girl was on the pill but missed doses during vacation. The guy expected her to take it properly and didn't use backup protection. He argues that she should have informed him if she couldn't take the pill. He then tells her he's not ready for a baby and offers to support her if she aborts but can't stay with her if she keeps it. \n\nHe's in a vulnerable position, young, and not financially stable. But on the other hand, pressuring a partner to have an abortion can be seen as controlling. The key here is that the decision to have an abortion should be the woman's choice. Even if there's shared responsibility, the man can't force her to make that decision. \n\nThe guy's anger that she didn't tell him about missing pills might indicate he didn't take responsibility for his own part. Contraception is shared responsibility, but the pill is her method. He didn't use condoms as backup. She admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly but didn't tell him, which might be a miscommunication. However, he's placing blame on her for the pregnancy, which might not be fair. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while he's not ready for a child, he can't impose his decision on her. The woman has the autonomy to choose. Even if they both agree, the decision to terminate is hers. So, pressuring her could be considered wrong. \n\nAlso, his ultimatum to break up if she doesn't abort is manipulative. He's using the pregnancy as a reason to end the relationship, which is not supportive. The emotional impact on her is significant, and he's adding to her stress by making it about his readiness. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend to make a medical decision that is her right to choose, and he's using the situation to control the outcome rather than supporting her. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
