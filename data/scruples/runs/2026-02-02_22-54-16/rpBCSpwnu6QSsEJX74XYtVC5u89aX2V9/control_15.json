Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is pretty intense. The girl is pregnant, they're both young, in university, and not in a position to have a baby. The guy argues that the girlfriend didn't use the pill properly and didn't communicate that, leading to the pregnancy. He then tells her she must abort the baby if she wants to stay with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl was on the pill, but she said she wasn't taking it properly because her schedule was off during vacation. The guy expected her to be on the pill correctly, which he thought was 99% effective. But he didn't use a backup method. So, maybe he's a bit in the wrong for assuming the pill would work perfectly without additional protection. But the girl didn't inform him about her irregular pill use. That's a big deal because she's an adult and should know to communicate that. However, he's also not without fault here.\n\nNow, the main issue is his ultimatum. He's telling her that if she wants the baby, he can't stay with her. That's a significant decision, and he's making her choose between the baby and the relationship. The problem here is that he's forcing her to make a choice that's not just about her, but also about their future. The girl is open to keeping the baby, but he's not considering her wishes and is essentially dictating the outcome. That seems really harsh. Even if he's not ready, the decision to have an abortion is hers to make, not his. He's putting pressure on her, which could be coercive.\n\nAlso, the guy is making a financial commitment to support a child if she chooses to keep it, but he's not able to support it in terms of lifestyle. He's 18, an apprentice, living with his parents. The girl is 20, a student with loans. They have no resources. So, he's acknowledging they can't support a child, but he's also not taking responsibility by staying. That's a bit self-centered because he's looking out for his own well-being above hers and the child's.\n\nBut then again, the girl didn't communicate her pill issues, which is a problem. She's 20, so she's an adult and should be responsible for her contraception. However, even if she made a mistake, the guy's response is extreme. He's not being supportive; instead, he's cutting off the relationship. Relationships require communication and mutual support. By making her choose between the baby and him, he's not being a partner in this situation. He's treating it as her fault entirely, which is unfair.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The girl is upset, and he's making it about his readiness. The decision to have an abortion is a personal one that should be made by the pregnant person. He's essentially taking away her autonomy by pressuring her to abort. That's a serious issue. Even if he has his reasons, he's not respecting her agency in the decision.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, depending on the country, abortion rights may vary, but generally, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's choice. By pressuring her, he's infringing on her rights. Also, he's not considering her feelings or her potential desires, just imposing his will.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy is in a tough spot, but his approach is harmful. He's not taking responsibility for his part in not using backup contraception and is placing the blame solely on her. His ultimatum is unfair and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
