Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated because it involves a pregnancy, decisions about abortion, and a relationship. \n\nFirst, the user is a 18-year-old guy who's dating a 20-year-old girl. They've been together seven months. The girl is pregnant, and the guy is upset because she didn't use the pill properly, even though she was on it. He expects her to handle the contraception, and when she didn't, he's asking her to have an abortion, threatening to leave her if she doesn't. \n\nThe girl is open to keeping the baby, but she's not clear on whether she really wants to. The guy feels tricked because he thought the pill was effective and that she was using it properly. He's not ready for a child, can't afford it, and is offering support if she goes through with the pregnancy but can't be part of it. \n\nNow, I need to consider if the guy is in the wrong. On one hand, he's facing a situation where he's not ready for a child and is honest about his limitations. He's also holding her responsible for the contraception, which is a common approach. However, is it fair for him to put the entire responsibility on her? Both partners should communicate about contraception and make sure they're on the same page. The girl admitted she wasn't taking the pill correctly, so she has some responsibility here. \n\nBut the guy's response is to demand an abortion, which is a major decision. Even if he's not ready, is it his place to pressure her into that choice? The girl is considering her options, and he's giving her an ultimatum. That could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. He's also not offering to take responsibility for the child, which might be part of the problem. \n\nContraception is a shared responsibility. If they weren't using backup methods, both could be at fault for not discussing and ensuring proper use. The guy is upset that she didn't tell him about the risk, but maybe he didn't check in on her pill usage or suggest alternatives. \n\nIn terms of the abortion decision, it's a personal and sensitive matter. He's making it conditional on staying with him, which might not be fair. She should have the right to make that choice without being pressured by her partner's ultimatum. Even though he's not ready, he's forcing her hand, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nOn the other side, he's a young man with financial constraints, and he's honest about his inability to support a child. The question is whether he's being realistic or selfish. It's hard to say, but he's not in a position to have a baby. However, his approach might be inconsiderate of her feelings and her autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion and not respecting her potential desire to keep the baby. Even though he's not ready, the way he's handling the situation could be seen as unfair. Alternatively, some might argue he's being realistic and honest. But the key issue is the ultimatum and lack of shared responsibility.\n\nHmm. I think the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he's making a decision that affects both of them without fully considering her autonomy and the complexity of her situation. Pressuring her into an abortion isn't fair, even if he's not ready for a child. Both should have discussed contraception more thoroughly, and he should take some responsibility for not ensuring safe sex methods.\n"
