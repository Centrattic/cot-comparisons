Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. The man is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She's on the pill but missed some doses during vacation, leading to pregnancy. He's asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. So even if the man doesn't want the baby, the final say should be hers. The fact that he's pressuring her might be a problem because it's her body and her choice. But maybe there's more nuance here.\n\nHe mentions she didn't use back-up protection and that he expected her to take the pill properly. He feels tricked because she didn't tell him about missing doses. But isn't it also his responsibility to use protection? Even if she's on the pill, using a backup like condoms is common, especially when schedules are off. Maybe he's not taking full responsibility here.\n\nHe's 18, still in an apprenticeship, living with his parents. She's a student with limited resources. They're both young and not in a position to have a child. But the pregnancy is a reality now. The man is giving her an ultimatum: abortion or losing him. That's a tough choice. It's pressuring her to make a decision based on his readiness, not hers. Her feelings and her autonomy are important here.\n\nThe fact that he's willing to pay child support if she keeps the baby but wants her to abort to stay with him might be seen as conditional support. It's like saying he's only supportive if they abort, which could be manipulative. Also, he's not taking responsibility for the situation, pointing fingers at her for missing pills. Maybe he should have used a condom regardless of the pill.\n\nBut he's also young and stressed. His reaction might be due to fear and not a mature understanding of shared responsibility. The key issue is whether he's respecting her autonomy. If he's pressuring her to make a decision that's not his to make, that's where he's wrong. Even if his intentions are about not being ready, the decision isn't his to control.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is putting pressure on his girlfriend to have an abortion, which is her decision. By making it a condition for staying in the relationship, he's not respecting her autonomy. That's likely where he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
