Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a young couple facing an unexpected pregnancy. The author is a 18-year-old guy who's been dating his 20-year-old girlfriend for seven months. She's pregnant, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The girl was on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she admitted she wasn't taking it properly because her schedule was off during university vacation. The author feels she should have used backup protection or told him to stop having sex. He's not ready for a baby, can't afford it, and doesn't think he can handle being a parent. He's giving her an ultimatum: abortion or he can't stay with her.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The girl is older, 20, and he's 18. They're both in university, living with parents, and not financially stable. The author is concerned about their ability to support a child. However, the girl might feel pressured by his ultimatum. He's making it clear that if she chooses to have the baby, he can't be part of the relationship. That's a huge decision for her to make, and he's putting the burden on her. \n\nBut wait, he did say he's not blaming her entirely. He's also considering his own responsibilities and the reality of their situation. He's not forcing her to have the abortion; he's just stating that he can't be in a relationship with a child involved. However, the fact that he's making her choose between him and the baby might be the issue. It's not his decision to make, even if he's the father. The decision about the pregnancy should be hers, not him dictating it. \n\nAlso, the method of contraception: she was on the pill but missed doses. He trusted she was taking it properly. That's a shared responsibility? Maybe he should have checked in or used a backup method. But he thought the pill was reliable. She didn't mention her issues with the pill, so maybe she's also at fault for not communicating. But then again, he's now using that as a reason to pressure her into an abortion. \n\nThe key point is that he's not considering her autonomy in the decision. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't force her to have an abortion. The decision should be hers. By giving her an ultimatum, he's not respecting her right to choose. So even if his reasons are valid (they can't support a child), he's in the wrong for imposing his will on her. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's pressuring her into a decision that should be hers alone. He's not considering her feelings and autonomy, even though he loves her and is conflicted. The fact that he's making her choose between him and the baby is problematic.\n"
