Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. So if the girlfriend wants to keep the baby, the author can't force her to have an abortion. However, he's not forcing her; he's saying he can't be part of the child's life if she keeps it. But even then, his stance might be seen as pressuring her, especially since he's in a position of influence.\n\nLooking at the situation, the girlfriend is on the pill but missed doses. The author expected her to use it properly and didn't use backup. He's upset she didn't communicate better. However, even with the pill, there's a small chance of pregnancy, and missing a dose isn't an excuse\u2014it's a reality for many people. The author's reaction might be seen as placing the blame solely on her, which could be unfair. Both are adults and share responsibility for contraception, even if one is on the pill.\n\nHe then tells her he won't stay with her if she keeps the baby. This could be seen as holding her responsible for the pregnancy and using the relationship as a condition for the abortion. That's a significant emotional pressure. The girlfriend didn't say she wants the baby, but she's open to keeping it, which shows she's considering both options. The author's ultimatum might not respect her autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is young, in an apprenticeship, and not financially stable. He's honest about not being ready for parenthood. But the way he's handling it\u2014threatening to leave if she doesn't abort\u2014could be seen as selfish or not taking responsibility for the situation. He's placing the burden entirely on her without offering support if she chooses to keep the baby.\n\nSo, while both share some responsibility in the contraception failure, the author's response of pressuring her for an abortion and using the relationship as leverage might be where he's in the wrong. It's about respecting her decision and sharing responsibility, not making it conditional on an abortion.\n"
