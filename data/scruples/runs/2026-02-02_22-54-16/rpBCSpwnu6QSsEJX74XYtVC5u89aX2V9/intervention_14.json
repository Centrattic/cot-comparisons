Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who asked their girlfriend to have an abortion is in the wrong. The situation is complex, so I need to consider both perspectives.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 18, and the girlfriend is 20. They've been together seven months. She got pregnant despite being on the pill, which they thought was over 99% effective. The boyfriend feels she didn't take the pill properly and didn't communicate the risk. He's not ready for a baby, has financial issues, and offers to support her if she has the abortion. She's open to keeping the baby, but he's firm about not being able to handle it.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. Both partners are young and in a university setting. Contraception is a shared responsibility. The boyfriend assumed the pill was sufficient, but maybe he should have used a backup method. The girlfriend admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly, which is her responsibility. However, not using a backup method might be his oversight. \n\nEthically, the decision about an abortion is typically the woman's right. The boyfriend is pressuring her to have an abortion, which could be a problem. Even if he's not ready, the choice shouldn't be his to make. He's putting her in a position where she has to choose between losing the child or losing him, which is a heavy burden. That part might make him at fault. \n\nAlso, his reaction is harsh. He's not offering support for her potential choice to keep the baby, which could show a lack of consideration. However, he's also young and under financial stress, which complicates things. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to weigh if his actions cross a line. Pressuring someone into an abortion is generally seen as wrong because it disregards their autonomy. Even if she's open to it, the pressure is still there. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) because he's imposing his decision on her. However, some might argue both are at fault for not using proper contraception. But the main issue is his ultimatum. So probably A.\n"
