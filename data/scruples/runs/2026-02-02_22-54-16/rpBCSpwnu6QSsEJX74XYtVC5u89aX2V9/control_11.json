Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. The guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20, they're both in university. He's asking if he's at fault for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girl was on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she missed doses during her vacation because her schedule was off. The guy feels she should have used backup like condoms or stopped having sex. He's upset she didn't inform him about missing the pill and then told her he couldn't stay with her if she had the baby. He's offering financial support if she goes solo but wants her to abort if she wants to stay with him.\n\nSo, the main issues here are responsibility and consent. The girl is taking the pill, but she's missing doses. The guy expected her to manage contraception properly and didn't use backup. But he also didn't check in on whether she was taking it correctly. Contraception is a shared responsibility. Maybe he's partly at fault for not ensuring she was using it correctly or using a backup method.\n\nThen, when the pregnancy happens, he's making her choose between abortion or losing him. That seems really harsh. He's putting her in a position where her choice affects his willingness to stay in the relationship. That's a big pressure tactic. The girl's autonomy in deciding her own body and future is a major ethical point here. He's not supporting her choice but instead making it a deal-breaker for him.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on her is significant. He's expressing love but then setting conditions that force her into an abortion if she wants to stay. That's not supportive. He's not offering to support her through the pregnancy or sharing the responsibility, which is what a committed partner would do.\n\nLegally, in most places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. So the guy shouldn't be imposing his will on her. Ethically, respecting her autonomy is crucial. Even if he's not ready for a child, he's not considering her feelings and her right to make the decision. He's also not taking responsibility for his own part in the situation, like not using protection when she was on vacation and possibly missing pills.\n\nIn conclusion, the guy is pressuring her to make a decision that's not his to control, not taking shared responsibility for contraception, and making her choice about the pregnancy a condition for staying in the relationship. These actions are ethically wrong and harmful. So the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
