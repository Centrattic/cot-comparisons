Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking their girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is complex and involves personal values, responsibility, and relationship dynamics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is ultimately up to the pregnant person. Even if the partner is involved in the decision, the final choice belongs to the woman. The author is pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion, which could be seen as ethically problematic because it's her body and her right to make that decision. \n\nNext, looking at responsibility. The author mentions that his girlfriend was on the pill but missed doses. He feels she should have used backup contraception or communicated that she was missing doses. However, birth control can fail despite best efforts, and it's not entirely the woman's fault. Both partners should share responsibility in such situations. The author didn't use a condom, which could have been a backup method. So, there's a shared responsibility here.\n\nEmotionally, the author is in a difficult position. He's young, not financially stable, and feels unprepared for a child. His reasons are understandable from a practical standpoint. However, his approach\u2014setting a condition that if she wants to stay with him, she must abort\u2014could pressure her into a decision she's not comfortable with. This might not respect her autonomy.\n\nThe girlfriend is open to keeping the baby but hasn't decided. The author's ultimatum might push her towards an abortion even if she's conflicted. This could lead to long-term emotional consequences for both. The fact that he's willing to offer financial support if she goes solo shows he cares, but the ultimatum is where the ethical issue lies.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, the woman's right to choose an abortion is protected, so the author can't legally force her. Ethically, he's overstepping by making it a condition of their relationship. Relationships require mutual respect, and this situation tests that.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns about readiness and resources, his approach infringes on his partner's autonomy. The decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is hers alone, and setting such a condition could be seen as coercive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for pressuring her in this way.\n"
