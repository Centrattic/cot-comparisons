Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the couple is young, in university, both not in a financial position to have a child. The girlfriend is on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she missed doses during vacation, leading to pregnancy. The author felt she should have communicated the risk and used backup contraception, and now he's not ready for a child, so he's telling her he can't stay with her if she goes through with the pregnancy.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is being honest about his inability to be a parent right now, which is a valid concern. He's also stating that the decision isn't just his, but he feels it's her responsibility because she mismanaged the contraception. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel pressured or that her autonomy over her own body is being disregarded. The author's ultimatum could be seen as controlling, especially since the pregnancy is a shared responsibility, even if the contraception was her method.\n\nBut wait, the pill is her method, and he assumed it was reliable. However, he didn't check in with her about whether she was taking it consistently. So maybe there's some shared responsibility here. The author is now making a decision that affects her reproductive choices, which can be a big issue. Even if he's not ready, the final decision should ideally be hers, unless they can find a compromise. His ultimatum might be seen as putting pressure on her to abort against her wishes, which is problematic. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned she's open to keeping the baby but hasn't decided. He's making a decision based on his own readiness without fully considering her desires. The fact that he's willing to provide financial support if she chooses to be a single mother shows he's trying to be fair, but the ultimatum still puts her in a difficult position. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that he's being selfish, while others might understand his perspective given their circumstances. However, the key point is that the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is typically seen as the woman's right. By giving her an ultimatum, he's infringing on her autonomy, which is a critical ethical issue. \n\nSo, while his concerns are valid, the way he's handling it by forcing her to choose between abortion or losing him might be the wrong approach. Therefore, he could be in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and is making a decision that should be hers alone.\n"
