Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, both are young\u201418 and 20\u2014and in university. They\u2019ve been dating seven months. The girlfriend is pregnant. She was on the pill, but she didn\u2019t take it properly during her vacation, leading to the pregnancy. The author feels she should have used a backup method or stopped having sex when she wasn\u2019t taking the pill correctly. He\u2019s not ready for a baby, can\u2019t afford it, and doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with a child involved. He tells her he can\u2019t stay if she has the baby and will only help if she aborts. She\u2019s upset, and he feels conflicted but stands by his decision.\n\nNow, the question is whether he\u2019s in the wrong. Let me consider the key points. \n\n1. **Responsibility and Communication**: The author expected his girlfriend to take the pill properly and to communicate if she wasn\u2019t. She admits she wasn\u2019t taking it as needed but didn\u2019t inform him. However, it\u2019s also the responsibility of both partners to discuss contraception. Maybe he should have suggested using a backup method, but she was on the pill. \n\n2. **Shared Decision-Making in Pregnancy**: The decision to abort is a major one, and it\u2019s typically the woman\u2019s choice, especially since she\u2019s the one carrying the child. The author is imposing his decision on her, which could be considered wrong because it\u2019s her body. Even if he\u2019s not ready, the choice should be hers to make, not his. \n\n3. **Emotional Impact**: He acknowledges that the abortion breaks his heart but also that he\u2019s not ready. However, pressuring her to abort for his own readiness might be selfish. The article mentions that she\u2019s open to keeping the baby but hasn\u2019t decided. He\u2019s making the choice for her, which could be seen as controlling. \n\n4. **Financial and Practical Considerations**: Both are in a tough financial situation. The author is right that they can\u2019t support a child now. But this is a consideration for both options. However, the decision to continue or terminate should be hers, and he\u2019s using this as a reason to force her to abort. \n\n5. **Relationship Dynamics**: He\u2019s willing to leave the relationship if she doesn\u2019t abort, which adds pressure. This might be seen as using the pregnancy as a way to end the relationship without taking full responsibility. \n\nLegal and ethical perspectives: In many places, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. The author doesn\u2019t have the authority to demand an abortion. Even if he\u2019s not ready, he can\u2019t make that choice for her. His approach might be considered wrong because it disregards her autonomy. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he\u2019s being realistic about their circumstances. But the key issue is that the decision should be hers, and he\u2019s pressuring her. So, while his fears are valid, his approach is problematic. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (he\u2019s in the wrong) because he\u2019s not respecting her autonomy in the decision and is using the pregnancy as a reason to end the relationship without considering her choice.\n"
