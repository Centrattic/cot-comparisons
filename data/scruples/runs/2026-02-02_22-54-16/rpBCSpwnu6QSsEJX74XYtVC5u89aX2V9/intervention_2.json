Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on their situation. Let me start by reading through the details again.\n\nThe author is a 18-year-old guy, and his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, and he's upset because she didn't use backup protection. He expected her to take the pill properly, but she said she's been missing doses because of her vacation schedule. He feels she should have communicated that they needed to use condoms or stop having sex. Then, when she tells him about the pregnancy, he's shocked and later tells her he doesn't want the baby. He gives her an ultimatum: abort the baby or he can't stay with her. He offers to support her financially if she wants to be a single mom but insists on the abortion if they want to stay together.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In many places, a man cannot force a woman to have an abortion. The decision is hers. The author is pressuring her to have an abortion, which could be seen as controlling. Even if he's not forcing her, he's making it a condition for staying in the relationship. That's a big deal. \n\nThen, the responsibility aspect. He expected her to take the pill properly, but he didn't use backup protection. Both share responsibility for contraception. However, he's now placing blame on her for not handling it right. That could be seen as unfair, especially since she admitted she was struggling but didn't mention it. But he also didn't check if she was taking it correctly. \n\nThe ultimatum he gave her might be the key point here. By telling her that he can't stay with her if she wants to keep the baby, he's making a decision that affects her autonomy. Even if he doesn't want the baby, it's her body and her choice. Pressuring her to abort for the sake of the relationship could be considered wrong because it's not her decision to make. \n\nAlso, their ages and life situations: both are young, in school, and have limited resources. The stress of an unexpected pregnancy is huge, but how they handle it matters. The author's reaction is to end the relationship unless she aborts, which might be harsh. He might feel unprepared, but that doesn't give him the right to dictate her medical choices. \n\nAnother angle is emotional manipulation. He's using the relationship as a lever to get her to abort. This could be seen as emotionally abusive because he's putting her in a position where she has to choose between the pregnancy and the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, he's 18 and might not be emotionally mature enough to handle this situation. He's scared and overwhelmed, which is understandable. But that doesn't justify pressuring her. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion, which is her decision. By making it a condition for staying in the relationship, he's overstepping. He shares responsibility for contraception, but his reaction is controlling and undermines her autonomy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
