Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, a 18-year-old male in a seven-month relationship with his 20-year-old girlfriend, found out she's pregnant. They were using the pill as contraception, and she was supposed to be on it properly. The key points here are that she admitted she wasn't taking the pill correctly because her schedule changed during university vacation. Now, the user is asking if he's in the wrong for suggesting an abortion.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The user is young, still in an apprenticeship, living with his parents, and his girlfriend is a student relying on loans. They're both in a position where a child would be a significant burden. The user feels that she should have communicated her contraceptive issues. She didn't use backup protection, and he believed the pill was over 99% effective. She didn't tell him about her missed pills, which he sees as a risk they should have discussed.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman is 20, old enough to manage her birth control. The user is holding her responsible for the situation. But he's also suggesting that if she doesn't abort, he can't stay with her, which ties their relationship to the pregnancy decision. That seems like putting pressure on her, which might not be fair. The question is whether the user is wrong for not taking responsibility or for not supporting her decision to have the baby.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that it's not his fault she didn't handle the contraception properly. But in reality, both partners share responsibility for contraception. Even if she was on the pill, it's possible both should have used a backup method, especially if her routine was disrupted. The user didn't check in with her about whether she was taking the pill correctly, which might be a factor.\n\nHowever, the user is also young and not in a position to support a child. His main concern is their financial and emotional readiness. The problem arises when he tells her that if she wants the baby, he can't stay with her. That forces her to make a decision that affects her future based on his readiness, which could be seen as selfish or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn many cases, the decision to have an abortion is personal and should be made without pressure from a partner. By making her choice contingent on her having an abortion, the user might be overstepping. He's not wrong in feeling unprepared, but using the relationship as leverage for the pregnancy decision could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, while both might share some responsibility, the user's approach of breaking up if she doesn't abort could be seen as wrong because it pressures her into a decision that's not his to make. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. Maybe in the context of their relationship and their ages, his position is more about not wanting to be a parent yet, but the way he's handling it is the issue.\n"
