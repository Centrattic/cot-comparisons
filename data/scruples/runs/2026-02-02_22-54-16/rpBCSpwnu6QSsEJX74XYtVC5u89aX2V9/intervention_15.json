Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who asked the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a 18-year-old guy who's in a seven-month relationship with a 20-year-old girl. She got pregnant while on the pill, and he's asking if it's his fault for wanting her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I should consider the basics. Both are young, in university, and not in a financial position to have a child. The girl was on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she admitted she wasn't taking it properly because she's on vacation and not on her normal schedule. The guy is upset because he thought she was using it correctly and didn't communicate that she was missing doses. He feels tricked because she didn't tell him about the missed pills and they didn't use backup protection.\n\nHe says he's not ready for a child, can't afford to support a baby, and doesn't want to lose her, but he's willing to pay child support if she chooses to keep the baby. He's giving her an ultimatum: abort the baby or he can't stay with her. He's conflicted because he loves her and the baby but feels it's not the right time.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. First, both are adults, albeit young. The girl is 20, which is an adult age in many places. She was on the pill but didn't take it consistently. The guy trusted that she was using it properly and didn't question it. When he found out, he realized she hadn't been taking it correctly and didn't communicate that. He's upset because he felt she should have used backup or told him to stop having sex. She didn't, so he feels it's her responsibility.\n\nHe's asking her to have an abortion, which is a significant decision. But he's also in a position where he's not willing to support a child financially or emotionally. Is it fair for him to put the entire burden on her? Also, how does their relationship dynamic play into this? She's open to keeping the baby but doesn't clearly state her preference. He's making a decision based on his readiness, which is valid, but does he have the right to dictate her choice? \n\nIn some contexts, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. However, in a relationship, both partners should ideally discuss and support each other's decisions. The guy is pressuring her to abort, which could be seen as controlling if he's not considering her feelings or her decision. But he's also making a choice that he's not ready for a child, which is a personal decision. \n\nAnother angle: the girl didn't take the pill properly but didn't communicate that, leading to the unintended pregnancy. He could argue that she should have taken more responsibility by using backup methods or informing him. However, the guy didn't check in on her pill usage either. They both might share some responsibility here. \n\nThe ultimatum he's giving her\u2014either abort or he leaves\u2014could be seen as pressuring her into a decision that he's making for both of them. Even though he's not forcing her physically, emotionally, he's saying he can't stay if she doesn't comply. That might be problematic because it's not her decision to make. The girl needs to make her own choice about the pregnancy, regardless of his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his limitations. He's not ready for parenthood, and he's being upfront about that. But the way he's presenting it as an ultimatum might be the issue. He's not supporting her in making her own decision but instead making it conditional on his own terms. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, the woman's autonomy is prioritized. So even if the pregnancy resulted from her not taking the pill correctly, the decision about what to do with the pregnancy is hers. The guy can express his concerns, but he can't make that choice for her. By giving her an ultimatum, he's trying to control her decision, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he's being realistic about their situation. They're both young, in school, and can't support a child. He's not forcing her to abort, but he's stating his position clearly. If she chooses to keep the baby, he's willing to help financially, which is a responsible approach. But the ultimatum aspect\u2014leaving the relationship if she doesn't abort\u2014might be where the line is crossed. It's his right to choose not to be a parent, but pressuring her to make a decision that's not his to make could be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while both parties have some responsibility in the situation, the key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. Since the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is ultimately the woman's, the author's ultimatum may be seen as overstepping, even if he's acting in his own best interest. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's imposing his decision on her rather than supporting her autonomy, even though his position is understandable given their circumstances.\n"
