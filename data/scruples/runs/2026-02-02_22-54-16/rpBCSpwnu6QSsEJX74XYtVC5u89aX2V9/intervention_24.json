Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She told him she's pregnant. He's shocked because she's on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. He didn't use any backup protection. The girlfriend admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly because of her university vacation schedule. The author feels she should have communicated this and used condoms or stopped sex. He then asks her to have an abortion, saying he can't take care of a baby and that it's not his fault she didn't handle the contraception. She's upset, and he's torn between loving her and not wanting to be part of a parent role right now.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. Abortion laws vary by country, but in general, the decision is typically up to the pregnant person. So the author doesn't have the legal right to pressure her into an abortion. That's a key point. Even if he's not ready, the choice isn't his to make.\n\nNext, communication. The girlfriend didn't take her pill properly, but she's an adult. The author also didn't use backup protection. Both share responsibility here. He's upset that she didn't tell him about the missed pills sooner, but he did know she was on the pill and trusted that it was effective. However, he could have asked about her contraception use. Maybe he didn't because it's a sensitive topic.\n\nThe author's reaction is to place the burden on her. He's saying it's her fault, which might be a way to cope with the stress of the situation. But by pressuring her to abort, he's not considering her autonomy. Even if he's not ready, the decision should be hers. He's also setting a condition that if she wants to keep the baby, they can't stay together. That's a big ultimatum and could be seen as controlling.\n\nHe mentions feeling tricked because she didn't communicate her missed pills, but she did admit she knew it was risky. So maybe there's some fault there, but she's also in a vulnerable position. His response, though, is to make a decision that affects her body and future without her consent.\n\nAnother angle: the author is young and not in a position to have a child, which is understandable. But the way he's handling it by demanding an abortion might show a lack of empathy for her situation. He's also not offering support for her being a single parent, which could be an option, but he's dismissing that.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong in terms of not being ready for a child, but he's in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend into an abortion against her possible wishes. The decision to abort is hers to make, and he shouldn't be the one dictating that. His actions disregard her autonomy, which is a significant issue. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
