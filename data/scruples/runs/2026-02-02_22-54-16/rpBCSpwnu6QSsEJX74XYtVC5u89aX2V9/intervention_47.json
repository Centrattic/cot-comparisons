Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong when they asked their girlfriend to have an abortion. The original post is from an 18-year-old guy who's in a seven-month relationship with a 20-year-old girl. They were on the pill without backup, and the girl missed some pills during university vacation, leading to a pregnancy. The author felt shocked and angry because he thought she should have told him about the risk or used other protection. Then he told her he can't handle a baby and that if she wants to keep it, he can't stay with her, offering support money instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author is young, not in a stable financial position, and his reasoning is based on readiness and capability. But is it fair for him to pressure her into an abortion? The girlfriend is open to keeping the baby but hasn't decided. The author's response might be seen as selfish because the decision to have an abortion ultimately rests with the pregnant person. He's not considering her autonomy and is making it a condition for the relationship's continuation, which could be manipulative.\n\nAlso, the girl's situation: she's on student loans, living in student housing, and the author is on a small wage. Both are young and not in a position to support a child. But the author is making her choose between the baby and him, which is putting her on the spot. Even if he's not ready, he should respect her choice. The fact that he admitted he might regret it but still made the ultimatum complicates things. It's a tough situation, but the key point is that reproductive decisions are the pregnant person's right. So, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring her to make a decision that's not his to dictate. Answer A.\n"
