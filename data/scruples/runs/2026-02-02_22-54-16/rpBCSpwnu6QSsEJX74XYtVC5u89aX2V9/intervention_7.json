Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The answer should be A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend is 18, the girlfriend 20. They've been dating seven months. She's pregnant. He's upset because she was on the pill but missed doses during vacation. He feels she should have used backup protection or told him they needed to stop. Now he's pressuring her to have an abortion, saying he's not ready and can't handle a child.\n\nKey points: Contraception responsibility, communication, autonomy, relationship dynamics. The girl is on the pill, but missed doses. The boyfriend didn't use condoms as backup. The pill's effectiveness is high, but not 100%, so the responsibility isn't solely on her. He didn't check in with her about pill adherence. He's now pressuring her to abort, which is a major decision. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that she didn't handle contraception properly. But in a relationship, both partners share responsibility for contraception. The girl might have thought the pill was sufficient, especially if they weren't using other methods. She did mention her schedule issues, but he didn't consider that. By not using backup, he also contributed. \n\nWhen the situation arises, he's angry but doesn't confront her about the missed pills. Instead, he demands an abortion. This could be seen as shifting blame onto her for the pregnancy, even if he shares some responsibility. Pressuring a partner for an abortion is a serious matter. It's her body, and the decision should be mutual, but he's making it conditional on their relationship. That could be seen as coercive. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. In many contexts, pressuring a partner for an abortion is problematic because it's a major life decision and the woman's autonomy is key. The boyfriend's reasoning (not ready, financial issues) is valid, but his approach\u2014linking the abortion to the continuation of their relationship\u2014could be seen as manipulative. He's not taking full responsibility; instead, he's placing blame on her for missing pills. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend is 18 and still living with his parents. The girl is 20 and a student. They both have limited resources. The boyfriend's decision to not be involved if she keeps the baby is his choice, but pressuring her to abort because of his readiness is another issue. The idea that it's \"not her fault she didn't handle contraception properly\" is part of the problem. Both should have communicated better. \n\nIn terms of ethics and common advice, it's often recommended that both partners take responsibility for contraception. The boyfriend's approach here is to make the abortion a condition for staying in the relationship, which is a heavy burden to place on the woman. It's possible he's in the wrong because he's not sharing the responsibility but instead making her the sole one accountable, even though he didn't use backup methods. His emotional response and the way he's framing the situation as her fault could be seen as unfair.\n"
