Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy, and the guy is asking if he's at fault for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are young, students, and not in a position financially or otherwise to have a child. The guy is 18, she's 20. They've been together seven months. The girl was on the pill, but she didn't take it properly because of her schedule during university vacation. He feels she should have communicated that she wasn't taking the pill correctly and used backup like condoms. \n\nHe argues that she should have told him about her contraceptive failure. The girl, on the other hand, might feel that the responsibility wasn't entirely hers. Maybe she thought the pill was sufficient and that he should have used a condom as backup. But the guy didn't, trusting the pill's effectiveness.\n\nNow, he's asking her to have an abortion, threatening to leave if she doesn't. That's a big decision, and pressuring someone into an abortion is a serious matter. But he's also in a tough spot, not ready for a child, and they can't support a baby. However, the fact that he's essentially giving her an ultimatum\u2014either abort the baby or he leaves\u2014could be problematic. \n\nHe also mentions he's not blaming her, but he's making it clear that he feels the responsibility is hers for not managing her contraception. But in reality, both partners should have discussed and used proper protection. Maybe they both share some responsibility here.\n\nThe key point is whether pressuring a partner to have an abortion is wrong. Even if the situation is difficult, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a major one and shouldn't be forced. The guy is making it about his readiness and their financial situation, but the girl's autonomy in the decision is crucial. By setting that ultimatum, he's not respecting her choice, even if he's struggling with it himself.\n\nSo, while the situation is complex and both may have made mistakes in contraception, the author's approach of pressuring her to abort and threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't seems to be in the wrong. It's not just about the pregnancy but how he's handling the situation, not considering her autonomy and emotional state fully.\n"
