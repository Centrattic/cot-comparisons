Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation involves a 18-year-old male and a 20-year-old female who are in a seven-month relationship. The girlfriend is pregnant, and the author is advocating for an abortion, feeling that it's her responsibility because she was on the pill but missed doses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the user mentioned the author is 18, but still in university, and the girlfriend is 20, in many places, both are legally adults. However, the legality of abortion varies by location. The question doesn't specify where this is happening, but I'll assume it's a place where abortion is legal, as the user didn't mention any legal barriers. \n\nNext, the ethical and moral aspects. The author feels the decision should be hers, but he's pressuring her to have an abortion. Even though he loves the baby to some extent, he's making the decision based on their financial and life circumstances. The girlfriend is open to keeping the baby but hasn't firmly decided. The author is saying he can't stay with her if she chooses to keep it, which might be seen as coercive. \n\nContraception responsibility is a point here. Both partners share responsibility, but the author is placing blame on the girlfriend for missing her pill. While she did miss doses, the author didn't suggest using backup methods, which he admits. So, there's shared responsibility. \n\nThe author is in a vulnerable position\u2014both are young, financially unstable. He's not ready for parenthood, which is understandable. However, making the decision for her, even if it's about their future together, could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's autonomy is crucial here. Even if she's open to abortion, the pressure from him might influence her decision, which is problematic.\n\nEmotionally, the author is conflicted but firm. He's aware he might be an asshole but feels justified. The key issue is whether he's respecting her autonomy. If she's considering keeping the baby but he's pressuring her to abort to stay together, that's a strong argument for him being in the wrong. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, reproductive rights emphasize the woman's right to choose. The author's ultimatum could infringe on that. Even if both are responsible for the situation, the decision to terminate should be hers, not his. By making it a condition for staying in the relationship, he's not respecting her autonomy fully.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because he's pressuring the girlfriend into a decision that's hers to make, even if they're both young and the situation is challenging. The balance between shared responsibility and individual autonomy tips towards her having the final say, and his ultimatum could be seen as coercive.\n"
