Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 18-year-old guy asking his 20-year-old girlfriend to have an abortion because she became pregnant while on the pill, which he thought was 99% effective. He's upset she didn't use back-up protection and felt tricked because she didn't tell him she wasn't taking the pill properly. He then gives her an ultimatum: abort the baby or he can't be in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, a person cannot force someone else to have an abortion. The decision to terminate a pregnancy is typically up to the pregnant person. The boyfriend is pressuring her to make a choice that affects her body and future. That seems problematic because it's not her decision to make.\n\nThen there's the issue of responsibility. The story mentions they were using the pill as contraception. The guy assumed it was 99% effective and didn't use condoms. The girlfriend admitted she wasn't taking the pill correctly, which the guy sees as her fault. However, even if she was responsible, both partners should have discussed and possibly used additional protection. The boyfriend didn't check in with her about her pill usage, so maybe he shares some responsibility here.\n\nEmotionally, the guy is in a tough spot. He's young, not financially stable, and feels unprepared for parenthood. His reaction is understandable from a personal standpoint, but forcing an ultimatum on his partner isn't healthy. Relationships require mutual respect and support, especially in tough situations. By making her choose between the abortion or losing him, he's putting immense pressure on her, which can be seen as selfish or not considering her autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is the maturity level. Both are young and in university. The guy is an apprentice with a small wage, and the girlfriend is on student loans. They might not be in a good place financially or emotionally for a child. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014threatening to leave if she doesn't abort\u2014could be seen as immature and not supportive.\n\nEthically, the key point is autonomy. The girlfriend has the right to decide what happens with her body. The boyfriend's insistence on an abortion without her full consent is a violation of her rights. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't make that decision for her. His approach is more about his own readiness than her well-being.\n\nAlso, the initial assumption that the pill is 99% effective is correct, but user error (not taking it properly) reduces that effectiveness. However, he didn't follow up with her to ensure she was taking it correctly, which is a shared responsibility in a relationship. He might have been overconfident in the pill's effectiveness without verifying her adherence.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is key. They should have discussed their expectations and backup plans. The girlfriend didn't mention her struggles with the pill, which is a communication breakdown. But the boyfriend didn't check in with her either. Both have some responsibility here, but the main issue is his ultimatum, which is not acceptable.\n\nSo putting it all together, the guy is pressuring his girlfriend to terminate a pregnancy against her will, which is ethically wrong. Even if his reasons are based on personal readiness, the act of forcing a decision on her is a violation of her autonomy. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
