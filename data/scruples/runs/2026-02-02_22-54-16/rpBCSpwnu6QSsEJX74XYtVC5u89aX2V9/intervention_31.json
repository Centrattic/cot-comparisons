Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. First, I need to consider the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author is 18 and his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, which she admitted she didn't take properly. He felt she should have used backup methods or stopped having sex if she couldn't manage the pill. He's not ready for a child, can't afford it, and is in an apprenticeship. He told her he can't stay with her if she has the baby and wants her to abort unless she wants to be a single mom. \n\nNow, legal aspects vary by country, but since it's not specified, I'll assume it's possible. But the main question is moral. Did he have the right to make that decision? Well, the decision to have an abortion is primarily hers. Even though they're in a relationship, the pregnancy is hers. Pressuring her to terminate could be seen as controlling. He might feel it's for the best, but it's her body. Also, he's under 18, which might affect the legal context, but again, not sure. \n\nHe didn't seem to consider her feelings and options. She mentioned she's open to keeping the baby, but he dismissed that. He's putting conditions on staying with her based on her decision. That could be seen as selfish or not respecting her autonomy. On the other hand, he's not ready for parenthood, which is a valid concern. But the way he's handling it, ultimatums and pressure, might be the issue. \n\nSo, while his concerns are understandable, he's overstepping by making the decision for her. The right approach would be to support her in her choice, whether it's abortion or adoption, rather than forcing her to abort to stay together. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy.\n"
