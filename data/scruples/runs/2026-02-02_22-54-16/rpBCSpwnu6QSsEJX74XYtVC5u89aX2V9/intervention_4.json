Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is a guy who's 18, dating his girlfriend for seven months. She's 20 and they're both in university. She got pregnant while on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective. He's upset because he believes she didn't take the pill properly, especially since she mentioned she's not on her normal schedule during uni vacation. He felt she should have told him to use condoms or stop having sex if she couldn't manage the pill. Now, she's pregnant, and he's advocating for an abortion because he feels they can't support a baby with their current financial and living situations. He told her he doesn't want the baby and that he can't stay with her if she keeps it, which made her really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The central issue is whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. From his perspective, he feels that she didn't handle contraception properly and that it's her responsibility. He's also concerned about their financial and living situations, which are very tight. He loves her and the baby but feels unprepared for parenthood. On the other hand, his girlfriend is open to keeping the baby but hasn't made a decision yet, and she's upset by his ultimatum.\n\nNow, let's think about the ethical and moral aspects here. In many relationships, major decisions like abortion are supposed to be mutual. The author is making a decision without fully considering his partner's feelings and autonomy. Even though he might feel it's his responsibility because of the contraceptive failure, the choice to terminate a pregnancy is ultimately the woman's. By putting an ultimatum on her, he's taking away her agency, which is problematic. \n\nHe also mentions that he's not ready and can't support a child. While that's a valid concern, it's not entirely her fault. Contraception is a shared responsibility, and while the pill is her method, he might have also expected her to manage it properly. However, it's not 100% effective, and life circumstances can affect adherence. His frustration is understandable, but his response\u2014threatening to leave if she doesn't abort\u2014crosses into controlling behavior. \n\nAnother angle is the age and life stage. Both are young, in university, and financially unstable. The stress of an unexpected pregnancy is huge, and their relationship is being tested. The author's reaction might stem from fear and immaturity. However, the fact that he's making a decision for his partner, especially one that's so significant and personal, is where the ethical issue lies. \n\nIt's important to note that regardless of fault in the contraceptive failure, the decision to have an abortion isn't something one person should impose on another. The girlfriend's autonomy is key here. Even if the author believes it's the right choice, he has no right to make that decision for her. His ultimatum could be seen as manipulative or emotionally coercive. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's trying to determine the outcome based on fault is a bit of a red herring. The focus should be on respecting her right to choose, regardless of who is to blame for the pregnancy. The question of who is at fault for the contraceptive failure might be a separate issue, but when it comes to the decision about the pregnancy, her right to make that choice is paramount. \n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including whether to continue a pregnancy. The author's insistence that she must abort to stay with him undermines her autonomy. Even if he's not in the wrong for the initial contraceptive issue, his actions in pressuring her for an abortion place him in a position where he's overstepping his bounds in the relationship. \n\nSo, putting this all together, while the author may feel he's acting in the best interest of their relationship and future, his actions are ethically questionable because they don't respect his partner's autonomy. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he is in the wrong, so option A.\n"
