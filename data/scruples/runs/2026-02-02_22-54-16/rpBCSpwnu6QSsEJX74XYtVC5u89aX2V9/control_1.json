Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's 18, his girlfriend is 20, they've been dating seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, but she didn't take it properly. He's asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person, and the partner doesn't have a say. So if the girlfriend wants to keep the baby, he can't force her to abort. But he's saying he doesn't want the baby and won't stay with her if she keeps it. That might not be illegal, but ethically, it's questionable.\n\nHe's also upset because she didn't use backup contraception. He thought the pill was over 99% effective, but he might not be aware that effectiveness can drop with missed pills. However, he's in a position where he's not using any protection, so maybe he should have considered using condoms too. But he's arguing that she should have taken responsibility.\n\nHe's 18, so he's still young. Both are in university, not in a stable financial position. He's saying he can't support a child. But is it fair for him to make the decision about the pregnancy without her consent? Even if he feels unprepared, the choice should ideally be mutual. However, if she's not sure about keeping the baby, but he's certain he doesn't want it, it's complicated.\n\nHe's also making it a ultimatum: abortion or he leaves. That's putting a lot of pressure on her. Even if he feels it's not his fault, controlling her reproductive choices is a problem. In many places, that could be considered coercive or even illegal under certain circumstances.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) The decision to abort is hers, not his. 2) He's pressuring her to make a choice that affects her body. 3) He's using their relationship as a leverage point. 4) He's not taking responsibility for the situation, instead blaming her.\n\nTherefore, even though he feels unprepared, the fact that he's trying to dictate her medical decision makes him at fault. The answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
