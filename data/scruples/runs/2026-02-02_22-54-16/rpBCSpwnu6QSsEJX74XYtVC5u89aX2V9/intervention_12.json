Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is that he's 18, she's 20, they've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and he's upset because she was on the pill but missed some doses during university vacation. He feels she should have used a backup method and that she didn't inform him of the risk. Now he's telling her he can't be part of the baby's life and is pressuring her to abort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is the woman's right, and the partner can't force that choice. Even though the man feels responsible, the final decision isn't his to make. So, by pressuring her to have an abortion, he might be overstepping his rights. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The girlfriend might feel that he's not taking responsibility, especially since they were both involved in the situation. She might feel pressured or blamed for the pregnancy. He's saying it's her fault for not taking the pill properly. But birth control isn't 100% effective even with perfect use, so maybe he's placing too much blame on her. \n\nAlso, their ages and life situations are important. Both are young and in school, so having a baby would be a huge life change. However, he's suggesting that she can't handle the situation and that it's not his fault. But in a relationship, both partners share responsibility for contraception. He might have assumed the pill was enough without discussing backups, which is his own oversight. \n\nHe's also giving an ultimatum: abort or lose him. That's a significant pressure tactic. It's not just about the baby but about controlling her choices. Even if he's not ready, he's taking away her autonomy. \n\nThe moral implications: even if he's not ready, the decision should be mutual. Pressuring her to abort because he's not ready could be seen as selfish, not considering her desires. He mentions she's open to keeping the baby but doesn't know her true feelings. He's making the choice for her, which is problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring her to make a decision that's hers to make, not sharing responsibility, and not considering her autonomy. Even if he's not ready, the decision to continue the pregnancy is hers. The correct answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
