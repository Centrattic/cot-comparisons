Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring their girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is that they're both young, in university, not financially stable, and the girlfriend is pregnant. She was on the pill but missed doses during vacation. The author feels she should have used backup contraception or communicated better, and now he's telling her he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, abortion is a legal option, but the decision to terminate a pregnancy is primarily the woman's choice because it's her body. The author is essentially putting the decision on her, which could be seen as pressuring her. But is that wrong? The author is in a tough spot, financially not ready for a child, and is worried about their future. However, the key point here is that the pregnancy is not just his responsibility; it's a shared situation. \n\nThe girlfriend is old enough and taking the pill, which is her method of contraception. The author might think she made a mistake, but he's not using any backup. So he's also relying on her to manage the method correctly. The article often discusses how both partners share responsibility in relationships, so maybe he's overburdening her. \n\nAlso, the argument that the author is not ready for a child is valid. But by making the decision for her, he's not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's in a hard place, the decision should ideally be mutual. However, the girlfriend is considering keeping the baby, which he can't accept. There's a conflict between their wishes. \n\nThe author says he's not using any back-up protection, so he's sharing in the responsibility of contraception. But the pill is effective only if taken consistently. The girlfriend admitted she missed doses, which she should have communicated. The author's anger might be justified in that she didn't inform him of the risk, but he's also not accounting for the fact that people can make mistakes, especially with a medication that requires daily use.\n\nThe main issue here is the pressure to have an abortion. Even if they both aren't ready, the decision to abort is ultimately hers. The author is framing it as a choice between him and the baby, which is a classic \"ITA\" (It's Not My Fault) scenario in such forums. The question is whether he's wrong for making that choice. \n\nIn many AITA threads, the consensus is that forcing a woman to have an abortion or pressuring her is wrong. But the author is not forcing her; he's saying he can't be part of the relationship if she chooses to keep the baby. However, this could still be seen as pressuring her, especially if she's not fully committed to having the baby. The line between shared decision-making and coercion can be blurry here. \n\nThe author's stance is that he's not at fault because he believes the girlfriend didn't handle the contraception properly. But in reality, both should have used protection. The pill's effectiveness relies on the user, so if she missed doses, that's her responsibility. But the author is also not contributing to backup methods. So maybe he's partially at fault for not using condoms even though she was on the pill.\n\nThe final decision depends on whether the author is respecting her autonomy. Even if he can't handle a child, he should support her decision if she's determined to keep it. By making the abortion a condition for staying in the relationship, he might be putting undue pressure on her, which is ethically problematic. The answer is likely A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her choice and adding emotional pressure.\n"
