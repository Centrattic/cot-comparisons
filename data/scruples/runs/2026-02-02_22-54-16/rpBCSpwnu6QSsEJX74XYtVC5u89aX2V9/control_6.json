Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. She's on the pill but missed doses because of her schedule, leading to pregnancy. The guy is upset because she didn't mention the risk and now he's asking her to have an abortion. He's offered support if she wants to do it but says he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend was on the pill, but she missed doses. The guy expected her to take it properly and didn't consider that maybe she was struggling. He didn't use a backup method, so he might share some responsibility. However, the pill is 99% effective, but missing doses can reduce that effectiveness. \n\nThe guy is in a difficult situation because he's not financially stable and feels unprepared for parenthood. His main argument is that he's not ready and they can't support a child. On the other hand, pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion is a big decision. It's her body, and he's making a demand that affects her deeply. \n\nIs it his fault? Well, he didn't use a backup, assuming the pill was enough. But the pill's effectiveness relies on consistent use. She had the responsibility to take it properly, but he also should have been aware of the risks and maybe used additional protection. However, the main issue here is that he's putting the decision-making power on her, but with a ultimatum that could end the relationship. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a complex situation. Both might share some responsibility. But the key point is that pressuring a partner to have an abortion is a significant issue. The author is making a demand that could end the relationship, which is harsh. Even if he's not ready, it's not his decision to make. So, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not taking responsibility for the situation and is pressuring her. However, the situation is nuanced, and some might argue he's in a tough spot. But ethically, he's making a choice that affects her, possibly without fully considering her autonomy. So, I think A.\n"
