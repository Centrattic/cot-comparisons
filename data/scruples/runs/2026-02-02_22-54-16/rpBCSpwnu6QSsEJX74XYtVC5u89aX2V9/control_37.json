Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nThe guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20, they've been dating seven months. She got pregnant even though she was on the pill. He's shocked because the pill is over 99% effective, and he expected her to be taking it properly. He's in an apprenticeship with a small wage and lives with his parents. She's a university student on student loans. They can't support a baby. He feels she should have told him about the contraception issues and that maybe they should have used condoms. When she tells him she's pregnant, he's stunned and angry that she didn't communicate. He tells her he doesn't want the baby and that if she wants to keep it, he can't stay with her. He offers to support her financially if she wants to be a single mom but says she has to abort to stay together. He's conflicted but firm in his decision.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the responsibility of contraception. Both partners usually share responsibility, but the pill is the woman's method here. She admitted she wasn't taking it properly due to her vacation schedule, which she considered a valid excuse. He might feel she didn't communicate her issues with the pill. But is it her fault? Maybe she didn't think about the consequences or thought she could manage, but she should have communicated better. However, expecting a 20-year-old to handle this perfectly might be unrealistic.\n\nHe's in a tough position financially and emotionally. He's 18, not ready for parenthood. But pushing her for an abortion is a big decision. Her autonomy is a key factor here. She's open to keeping the baby but hasn't decided. The author is pressuring her to abort to stay with him, which could be seen as controlling. Even if he's not ready, the decision to abort should be hers. He's saying he can't stay with her if she doesn't abort, which might be a form of emotional pressure.\n\nHe mentions he loves the baby and her but feels they can't support a child. However, making her choose between the baby and him is a significant burden. It's possible he's not wrong because his situation is real, but the way he's handling it could be problematic. The key point is whether he's respecting her autonomy. By not allowing her to decide to have the baby and be a single mom, even if he offers financial support, he's taking away her choice. That's a major issue. \n\nAlso, he blamed her for not taking the pill properly. Even if she's responsible for her method, he might have shared responsibility by suggesting alternative contraception or using condoms as a backup. He didn't, so maybe he's partly at fault for not ensuring protection. However, the primary responsibility for the pill lies with the woman. But the fact that he didn't consider backup methods could contribute to the situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is ultimately the woman's. The author is pressuring her to abort, which could be seen as violating her autonomy. Even if he's not ready, he can't make that decision for her. His offer to support her financially if she wants to raise the child is good, but he's not giving her the choice to do so. So, he's in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and for making her choice affect their relationship in such a definitive way.\n\nThe answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her decision-making power regarding her own body and is pressuring her to abort to maintain the relationship. Even though his financial situation is a factor, the ethical issue here is about her right to choose and his lack of support for her potential decision to keep the baby.\n"
