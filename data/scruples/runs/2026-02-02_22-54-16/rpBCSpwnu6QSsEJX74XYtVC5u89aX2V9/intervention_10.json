Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the main points from the story: The author is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She got pregnant despite being on the pill. The author feels she should have been more responsible with contraception, maybe using backup like condoms. He's not in a financial position to support a child, lives with his parents, has an apprenticeship. He tells her he's not ready and won't stay with her if she keeps the baby, essentially pressuring her to abort.\n\nHe mentions feeling tricked because she didn't tell him she wasn't taking the pill properly. But she admitted she knew the risks. He's conflicted but insists on an abortion. She's open to keeping the baby but might not really want it. He offers financial support if she chooses to be a single mom but wants her to abort to stay with him.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle here. Both parties are young and not in a stable position for a child. Contraception responsibility is a shared topic. The author feels she didn't take her pill properly and didn't communicate that. But is it fair for him to hold that against her? She might have thought the pill was sufficient, and maybe didn't realize the consequences. He's putting pressure on her to abort, which is a huge decision with emotional and physical ramifications. Even if he's not ready, the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be hers. By making her choice dependent on her agreeing to an abortion, he's potentially forcing her to make a choice that affects her body and future.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's offering financial support but only if she aborts might be coercive. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. From a rights perspective, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. By pressuring her to abort, he's infringing on that autonomy. Even if he's not ready for a child, the decision should be hers. His reasoning might be valid in terms of their life circumstances, but how he's handling it could be problematic. He's not taking responsibility for his part in the situation\u2014maybe they should have used additional contraception. But he's placing the blame solely on her and making her choice based on their relationship.\n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, the woman has the right to choose, and pressuring her to terminate a pregnancy can be seen as wrong. The fact that he's using the relationship as a condition for an abortion might be manipulative. Even though both are young, the ethical issue here is about respecting her autonomy. So even if he's not ready, he's in the wrong for not respecting her right to decide and for making her choice about their relationship contingent on an abortion.\n"
