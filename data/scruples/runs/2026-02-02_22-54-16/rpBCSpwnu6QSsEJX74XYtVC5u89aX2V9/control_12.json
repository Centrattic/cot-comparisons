Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is an 18-year-old guy whose 20-year-old girlfriend is pregnant. They've been dating seven months. She was on the pill, but she's been missing doses because of her schedule during university vacation. He argues that she should have used a backup method or told him they needed to stop having sex. He ends up pressuring her into having an abortion, saying he can't be a parent and won't stay with her if she keeps the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the decision about an abortion is the woman's right. Even though the man is involved, the final choice should be hers. The guy is essentially telling her she must have an abortion to stay with him, which can be seen as pressuring her against her will. That's a problem because it's her body and her decision.\n\nNext, responsibility for contraception. Both partners share responsibility. The guy didn't use a condom, assuming the pill was enough. She might have missed pills, but he also didn't suggest a backup method. So it's a shared responsibility. By blaming her, he's shifting the blame entirely onto her, which isn't fair. They both contributed to the situation.\n\nEmotional impact. He admits to feeling tricked and angry, but his response is to set ultimatums. Pressuring her to abort and threatening to leave if she doesn't is controlling and doesn't consider her autonomy. The fact that she is open to keeping the baby but he's not shows a lack of mutual decision-making. A healthy relationship should involve discussing options together, not making her feel forced.\n\nAge and maturity. Both are young, 18 and 20, which might affect their handling of the situation. However, the key issue is respecting her autonomy and shared responsibility. His ultimatum is not about responsibility but about his own readiness, ignoring her feelings and choices.\n\nThe argument that she should have told him about missing pills is valid, but she did admit it. His response is harsh and doesn't address the problem constructively. Instead of working together to decide, he's making demands.\n\nIn summary, the author is pressuring his partner to make a decision about her body, not considering her autonomy, and placing blame solely on her. That's a significant issue. The correct answer would be that he's in the wrong.\n"
