Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, an 18-year-old guy, asked his girlfriend, who's 20, to have an abortion after she got pregnant. They've been dating for seven months and weren't using backup contraception because she was on the pill. She admitted to not taking the pill properly due to her university vacation schedule, but the author feels she should have communicated that and used protection. He's not ready for a child and can't support one financially, so he's saying if she wants to keep the baby, he can't stay with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is young, financially unstable, and feels the pregnancy isn't their responsibility because the girlfriend didn't manage her contraception. But on the other hand, the girlfriend did take the pill, even if inconsistently. The author might be placing the blame solely on her, even though both are involved in the relationship. Also, the decision to have an abortion is a significant one and a personal choice. The author is pressuring her to make a medical decision that should be hers alone, which could be problematic.\n\nContraception is a shared responsibility. Even though she was on the pill, the author didn't consider backup methods. He might be making her the sole responsible party. Also, the fact that he's giving her an ultimatum\u2014either abort or he leaves\u2014could be seen as coercive. The girlfriend's feelings and autonomy are important here. The author is in a vulnerable position but may not be considering her emotional state and the stress of the situation.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a tough spot, not financially ready for a child, and his concerns are valid. But is it fair to place the entire burden on her? The key here is whether the author is respecting her right to make the decision. While he's not forcing her to have the abortion, he's making it a condition for continuing the relationship. That can be seen as manipulative or pressuring her, which is a form of being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though the author has valid concerns about his readiness and the financial aspects, the way he's handling the situation\u2014blaming her for not taking the pill properly and giving her an ultimatum\u2014may be where he's in the wrong. The decision about the pregnancy should be hers, and he shouldn't be making it a dealbreaker for the relationship.\n"
