Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 20, he's 18, and they've been dating seven months. She's pregnant, and she was on the pill but didn't take it properly. He feels she should have used backup or told him they needed to stop having sex. He's not ready for a child, financially and otherwise, and is asking her to get an abortion, saying he can't stay with her if she keeps the baby.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The author is making a decision that affects both of them and the potential child. The key points are about responsibility and autonomy. The girlfriend was on the pill, but he expected it to be 100% effective. However, the pill isn't perfect, especially if not taken consistently. She admitted she wasn't taking it properly, which she had a responsibility for. But he also didn't check in or use condoms, which is his responsibility too. \n\nNow, the author is pressuring her to have an abortion, which is a major decision. Even if he feels responsible, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is ultimately the woman's. Pressuring her to abort could be seen as imposing his will on her. He's making her choose between the baby and their relationship, which is a big deal. \n\nBut he's also young, not financially stable, and feels unprepared. His reasoning is that they can't support a child, which is a valid concern. However, he's not offering support if she keeps the baby, just financial assistance. The question is whether his actions are wrong for pushing for the abortion and threatening to leave if she doesn't go through with it. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, the woman has the autonomy to decide her own body. The author is trying to influence that decision, which some might see as wrong. On the other hand, he's not forcing her, just expressing his stance. But the way he frames it as a condition for staying in the relationship is problematic. \n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, the woman has the final say on abortion decisions, so the author's insistence could be seen as overstepping. Even if he's not forcing her to get the abortion, framing it as a requirement for their relationship to continue is pressuring her. So, maybe he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and making her choice dependent on their relationship status. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he's taking responsibility for his part and trying to do what's best for both. But the problem is that he's not considering her wishes fully and is using the relationship as leverage. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his partner to have an abortion and using their relationship as a condition for staying with her, which doesn't respect her autonomy. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
