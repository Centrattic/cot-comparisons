Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (18m) asking his girlfriend (20f) to have an abortion after she becomes pregnant. He's conflicted because he loves her but isn't ready for a child. The girlfriend was on the pill but missed doses during university vacation, which led to the pregnancy. The author is considering whether his stance is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's age is 18, and his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating for seven months. The contraceptive method was the pill, which he thought was 99% effective, but she missed doses. He didn't use a backup method, and when he found out about the pregnancy, he felt it was her responsibility to communicate the risk and adjust their sexual activity or use additional protection. He then told her he didn't want the baby and that if she wanted to keep it, they would have to break up. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the author is in a vulnerable situation\u2014still in school, living with parents, earning a small wage. He's not in a position to support a child financially or emotionally. He's also arguing that the responsibility for contraception was on the girlfriend, as she was the one on the pill. He didn't know she was missing doses and might not have used backup if he had. So, from his perspective, he's being honest about his readiness.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to decisions about pregnancy, both partners typically share responsibility. The author didn't check in on her pill usage, which is a common oversight. Even if she is on the pill, the expectation in a relationship is often mutual responsibility. By not using a backup method, the author also contributed to the risk. Moreover, pressuring her to have an abortion is a significant decision, and it's not her body alone. The girlfriend might feel that the author is shifting blame onto her instead of acknowledging shared responsibility. The emotional impact of such a decision is immense, and the author's ultimatum could be seen as selfish or not considering her autonomy and feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics and emotional manipulation. The author is placing the burden on her to decide, possibly making her feel like the pregnancy is entirely her fault. Even if he's not ready, the ultimatum could be hurtful and disregard her potential desire to continue the pregnancy. The girlfriend's statement that she doesn't want to lose him might indicate she's under pressure to make a choice that aligns with his needs rather than hers. This could lead to a very unfair situation where she has to make a difficult decision without considering her own wishes, just to save the relationship.\n\nThen there's the aspect of maturity. Both are young and in challenging financial positions. The author's focus on not being ready and the ultimatum may reflect immaturity in handling the situation. While it's true neither is prepared for parenthood, the way he's approaching the problem could be more considerate. The girlfriend's age is 20, and even though she's an adult, missing doses due to a vacation schedule is a mistake. However, it's also important to recognize that life circumstances can affect pill adherence. Expecting her to be on a strict schedule during a vacation might be unrealistic, but that's a separate point from whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's reasoning that if she wants to be a single mom, he'll help as he can, but if she wants to stay with him, she must abort. This seems to imply that the pregnancy is solely her issue to handle, which could be problematic. In a relationship, such a major decision should ideally be a mutual one, considering both partners' feelings and circumstances. The author's threat to leave if she doesn't abort, despite loving her, might be seen as prioritizing his own unpreparedness over her autonomy and the possibility of her wanting to proceed with the pregnancy.\n\nAlso, the author's anger at her for not informing him about missing the pill could be misplaced. While he's right to be concerned about the risk, he might not have been proactive in ensuring their contraceptive methods were safe. He could have used a condom as a backup, which is a shared responsibility. By not doing so, he's contributed to the situation. \n\nIn terms of emotional support, the author is conflicted, which is understandable. However, his approach might lack empathy. The girlfriend is clearly upset, and his ultimatum adds to her stress. It's possible that he's not considering her emotional state or the fact that she might want to keep the baby despite the challenges. \n\nLegally and ethically, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is up to the woman, so the author can't force her to have one. But by framing it as a condition for staying in the relationship, he's influencing her decision based on their dynamic. This could be a form of emotional pressure, especially if she feels that her partner's approval is necessary for the baby's future. \n\nIn summary, while both partners made mistakes in contraception, the author's reaction seems to place undue pressure on his girlfriend. The way he's handling the situation could be seen as self-centered, not fully acknowledging shared responsibility, and not respecting her potential desire to continue the pregnancy. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not giving her the autonomy to make the decision without coercing her through the threat of ending the relationship.\n"
