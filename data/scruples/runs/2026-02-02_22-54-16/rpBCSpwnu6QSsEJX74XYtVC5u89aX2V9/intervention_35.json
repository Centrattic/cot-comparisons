Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a young couple where the girlfriend is pregnant, and the guy is asking her to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy is 18, his girlfriend is 20. They've been dating seven months. She's on the pill, which is over 99% effective, but she admits she wasn't taking it properly because of her university vacation schedule. He feels she should have used a backup method like condoms. When she tells him she's pregnant, he's shocked and then angry that she didn't communicate the risk. He tells her he's not ready for a baby and that if she wants to keep it, he wants to break up. She's upset, and he's conflicted but stands by his decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. From his perspective, he's young, in an apprenticeship, living at home, and not financially stable. The idea of parenting without resources is daunting. He feels she should have taken more responsibility with contraception and communicated better. On the other hand, the girlfriend is also young, on student loans, and she admitted she wasn't taking the pill properly. However, she didn't inform him about missing doses, which could be seen as her responsibility.\n\nBut in a relationship, both partners share responsibility for contraception. Even if the pill failed, maybe they should have used condoms. However, the guy's reaction of demanding an abortion or breaking up might be seen as not sharing responsibility, especially if he's not ready. It's possible he's being selfish, but given their age and circumstances, it's also understandable they're unprepared.\n\nLegally and ethically, the decision to have an abortion is typically the woman's to make. By making it conditional on the relationship, the guy is pressuring her, which could be seen as controlling. Even if he loves her, he's not the one who has to carry the pregnancy. His ultimatum might be considered inconsiderate of her autonomy.\n\nHowever, considering their situation, the guy is also under a lot of stress and not ready for parenthood. The question is whether his actions are selfish or if he's within his rights to make that decision. Since both share responsibility for contraception, it's tricky. But the fact that he's making a demand for an abortion instead of supporting her choice or taking responsibility might tip the scales. The key issue here is the pressure he's putting on her and the ultimatum, which could be seen as him not respecting her autonomy in the decision.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy and is making a unilateral decision about her body. But given the context of their age and circumstances, it's a complex situation. However, in most cases, the woman's choice in such matters is paramount, and pressuring her could be seen as wrong.\n"
