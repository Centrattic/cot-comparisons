Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple is young, in their early 20s, in university, and not financially stable. The girlfriend is pregnant. She was on the pill but missed doses during her vacation, leading to the pregnancy. The author feels she should have used backup contraception or communicated better. He then demands an abortion, threatening to leave her if she doesn't, and offers financial support only if she chooses to be a single mom. \n\nNow, the key points here. The author is putting pressure on his girlfriend to terminate the pregnancy. Even though he's not ready for a child, he's making her the sole decision-maker. There's a power dynamic here because he's essentially saying he won't stay with her if she keeps the baby. That could be seen as coercing her decision. \n\nHe also mentions that she admitted to not taking the pill properly. While she's responsible for her contraceptive method, the author might also share some responsibility. Contraception is a shared responsibility, and using a method that relies on daily adherence can be tricky. But he didn't use a backup method, which is a point against him. However, the main issue here is the pressure he's putting on her to abort.\n\nEthically, the decision to have an abortion should be the woman's to make. The author is not respecting her autonomy by making it a condition for staying in the relationship. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't force her to terminate. His ultimatum is a form of emotional manipulation, which is generally considered wrong. \n\nAlso, considering their ages and financial situations, they might be unprepared for a child, but that doesn't justify pressuring her to abort. The emotional impact on both of them is significant, and he's adding to her stress by making the decision about her body. \n\nIn many legal and ethical frameworks, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. The author is overstepping by dictating her choice. Even if he's not the father, the fact that he's involved in the decision-making process is problematic because it's her body. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. He does express love for the baby, which shows he's not entirely callous. But his main argument is about their readiness, and he's using that as a reason to pressure her. The wrong here is in the ultimatum and lack of support for her choice. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring his girlfriend to abort and using the relationship as leverage, which is not acceptable. His approach disregards her autonomy and the shared responsibility in the situation.\n"
