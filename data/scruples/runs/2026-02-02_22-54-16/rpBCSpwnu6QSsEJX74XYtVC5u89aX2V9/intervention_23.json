Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They're both young, 18 and 20, in university, not financially stable. The girlfriend is pregnant, and the author feels it's her fault she didn't take the pill properly, so he's pressuring her to have an abortion, saying he won't stay with her if she doesn't.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility, communication, and mutual decision-making. The author seems to place the blame entirely on his girlfriend for not taking the pill correctly. But wait, while she was on the pill, the effectiveness can be compromised if not taken consistently. He didn't use a backup method either. Contraception is a shared responsibility, right? So maybe he's shifting blame here.\n\nAlso, he's making a demand that she has to abort the baby to stay in the relationship. That sounds really controlling. Even if they're not ready for a child, the decision to have an abortion should be mutual, not a condition for staying together. Pressuring someone into an abortion is a serious ethical issue. It's not just about his readiness but also respecting her autonomy and her choices.\n\nHe mentions that he's not ready and they can't afford a child. That's a valid concern, but the way he's handling it\u2014threatening the relationship if she doesn't abort\u2014seems extreme. Relationships should be built on support, even in tough situations. He's not offering to help her raise the child but instead is using the child's existence as a reason to end the relationship unless she complies with his wishes.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's open to keeping the baby but he's not considering that possibility shows a lack of willingness to find a solution together. Maybe there are other options, like adoption or support from family. But he's not exploring those, just pushing for abortion as the only option for himself.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. He's making her choose between the baby and him, which is a heavy burden. Even though he feels conflicted, his decision to frame it as a non-negotiable ultimatum is where the problem lies. Consent and mutual agreement are crucial in such decisions.\n\nSo, while he might be feeling overwhelmed, the way he's handling the situation\u2014blaming her, pressuring her, and threatening to leave if she doesn't abort\u2014is not appropriate. It's a complex situation, but the author's approach is where the issue is. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's not taking shared responsibility and is making a unilateral decision that affects her body and future.\n"
