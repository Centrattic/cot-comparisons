Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe author is an 18-year-old guy who's been dating a 20-year-old girl for seven months. She got pregnant while on the pill, and he's upset because she didn't use backup protection. He feels she should have told him they needed to use condoms or stop having sex when she started missing her pills. He's not in a position to have a baby, they're both young, and he's not ready. He told her he doesn't want the baby and that he can't stay with her if she decides to keep it. He's worried about their relationship but feels it's not his fault she didn't handle contraception properly.\n\nFirst, I should consider the responsibilities in a relationship regarding contraception. Both partners share the responsibility, right? Just because she's on the pill doesn't mean it's solely her responsibility. They should have discussed backup methods, especially if one of them isn't taking the pill correctly. The guy might be right that she should have communicated that she wasn't taking the pill properly. However, the pill's effectiveness is high, but missing doses can happen. Maybe the girl made a mistake, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's at fault entirely.\n\nThe bigger issue is asking her to have an abortion. Even if he's not ready for a child, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is up to the woman. It's her body, and he can't make that choice for her. That's a key point. The author's ultimatum that she must abort the baby for them to stay together could be seen as pressuring her to make a decision that's not his to make. So, while his reasoning is based on their current life circumstances, he's imposing his decision on her without considering her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the way he phrased it\u2014saying he can't stay with her if she has the baby\u2014might be seen as selfish. It's valid to feel overwhelmed, but making her choice about her pregnancy a condition for the relationship's continuation is problematic. He should have supported her in making the decision, even if he's not in favor of the child. \n\nOn the other hand, he's young and not in a financial position to support a child. His concerns about their future and ability to handle a baby are understandable. However, the way he's handling the situation by essentially giving her an ultimatum might be where he's in the wrong. The key is that the decision about the pregnancy must be hers. If he's pressuring her to abort, that's where the ethical issue lies.\n\nSo, even if he's not at fault for the pregnancy (since he might not have done enough to ensure protection as well), his insistence on an abortion as a condition for staying in the relationship is problematic. That makes me think he's in the wrong. \n\nWait, but the user said they thought the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe I need to check again. The author did ask her what she wants to do, but then gave her an ultimatum. Also, he's not taking responsibility for their sexual activity. Did he use a condom? The story says they weren't using backup protection. So maybe they both shared the responsibility of relying on the pill. But he's placing blame on her for not taking it properly. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the wrong part is him making her decision for her. Even if he's not ready for a child, he can't force her to abort. So the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he's pressuring her into an abortion and making her choice about her body a condition for their relationship. His arguments about not being ready are valid, but the way he's handling it is where he's at fault.\n"
