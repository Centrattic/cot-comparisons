Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, the situation: Both are young, in university, have limited financial resources, and the girlfriend is on the pill but missed doses. The author didn't use backup contraception, assuming the pill was effective. When she gets pregnant, he feels shocked and unprepared, leading to his ultimatum about the abortion.\n\nKey points to consider: \n- The girlfriend didn't use the pill correctly, which is her responsibility, but the author also didn't suggest alternative methods even though he knew there was a risk.\n- The author's response is to demand an abortion, giving her an ultimatum that if she wants to keep the baby, he'll support her financially but can't stay with her. This seems to pressure her to make a decision that aligns with his readiness, not hers.\n- The girlfriend is open to keeping the baby, but the author is dismissing that option, which could be seen as not respecting her autonomy.\n- The author's reasoning is based on their current inability to support a child, which is a valid concern, but the way he's handling it might be seen as selfish or not considering her feelings and choices.\n\nLegal and ethical aspects vary by region, but generally, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal one, and pressuring someone might not be legally wrong, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author's ultimatum could be seen as coercive, especially if he's the father. However, the girlfriend ultimately makes the decision, so whether the author is in the wrong depends on societal views on shared responsibility versus individual autonomy in such matters.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author is prioritizing his own unpreparedness and not taking full responsibility for the situation. Both parties share some responsibility for contraception. The author's reaction might be seen as a failure to communicate effectively and support his partner, which could be considered wrong. However, others might argue that his stance is realistic given their circumstances.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's approach is likely seen as unethical or selfish, making him at least partially in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
