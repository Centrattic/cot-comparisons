Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a 18-year-old male in a seven-month relationship with a 20-year-old female. She got pregnant, and he's asking Reddit if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion. The key points here are about responsibility, communication, and decision-making in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because his girlfriend was on the pill, which he thought was over 99% effective, so he didn't use backup contraception. The girlfriend mentioned she had trouble taking the pill consistently during her university vacation. The author feels she should have communicated that risk and used condoms instead. He then decided he doesn't want the baby and told her he can't stay with her if she chooses to keep it, implying she must abort to continue the relationship.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The girl is 20, so legally an adult, and she did try to use contraception, albeit inconsistently. The author is 18, still in an apprenticeship, living with his parents. Both are in a situation where supporting a child would be extremely challenging. The author's main argument is that he's not ready for parenthood and can't financially support a child. He also feels tricked because he expected the pill to be effective, and she didn't mention her irregular use of it.\n\nBut there are ethical considerations here. The decision to have an abortion is the woman's to make, and pressuring her to have one could be seen as violating her autonomy. Even if the author believes the pregnancy was due to her responsibility, the right to make reproductive choices is a significant factor. The fact that he's using the pregnancy as a reason to end the relationship if she doesn't abort is problematic because it's placing the burden entirely on her and not considering her wishes. The girlfriend mentioned she's open to keeping the baby but isn't clear on her own desires, which complicates things further.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also in a difficult position, not ready for fatherhood, and facing financial instability. His feelings of being tricked might stem from unmet expectations about contraception. However, both partners share responsibility in contraceptive decisions. The fact that he didn't use a condom as backup could be seen as his responsibility as well. The pill's effectiveness is high, but not 100%, especially if not taken correctly. So she did take the pill, but maybe not perfectly, leading to the pregnancy.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is whether it's right for the author to pressure her to abort. Even if he's not ready, the decision should be hers. Pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy could be seen as controlling, especially if she wants to keep the baby. The author is using the pregnancy as a dealbreaker for the relationship, which might not be fair to her. It's possible he's in the wrong because he's not accepting responsibility for his part in the situation and is imposing his will on her.\n\nHowever, some might argue that given their circumstances, an abortion is the only feasible option, and the author is being realistic. But in terms of ethics and rights, the woman's autonomy is paramount. The author's actions could be seen as pressuring her into a decision, which is not acceptable. So the answer might be A, yes, he's in the wrong for pressuring her to abort and not respecting her autonomy in the decision.\n"
