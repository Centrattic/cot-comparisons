Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a young couple who are not in a position to have a baby. The girlfriend is pregnant, and the author is asking if he's a \"twat\" for suggesting an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are in university, have limited financial resources, and are probably not emotionally or financially ready for parenthood. The author mentions that his girlfriend was on the pill but missed doses during her vacation. He feels she didn't communicate the risk properly, which led to the pregnancy. He's conflicted but ultimately tells her he's not ready and that if she wants to keep the baby, they can't stay together. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the pregnant person. The author is not the one carrying the pregnancy, so his opinion is important, but the final decision should rest with his girlfriend. By pressuring her to have an abortion to stay in the relationship, he's making her choice contingent on their relationship, which could be seen as coercive. \n\nHowever, he's also in a vulnerable position himself. He's 18, still in an apprenticeship, and not financially stable. He's honest about his feelings and responsibilities. The girlfriend is 20, which is still early in life for many people, and she's open to keeping the baby but also doesn't want to lose him. \n\nThe key issue here is autonomy. The author is not wrong for not wanting a child now, but he might be wrong in making the decision about the pregnancy. The girlfriend has the right to make her own choice, and if he's pressuring her, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, his initial reaction of feeling \"tricked\" because she didn't use condoms or stop sex when she wasn't on the pill properly is problematic. It shifts responsibility away from him, even though they both have a shared responsibility in contraception. \n\nIn summary, while the author's situation is understandable, his insistence on the abortion as a condition for staying in the relationship might be wrong because it's her body and her decision. He should support her in making the choice that's right for her, rather than making it a dealbreaker in their relationship.\n"
