Last week, she told me she's pregnant. Firstly, I felt shocked because she's on the pill. We weren't using any back-up protection, but I researched the pill as over 99% effective and, as a young woman in university and in no place to have a baby, expected she would be taking it properly. However, she told me that she'd been struggling to take it every day and properly because she's \"not on her normal schedule on uni vacation\". To me, this isn't an excuse. She should've told me we needed condoms or to stop having sex when she stopped being able to take the pill properly. She is old enough to know the risks. I feel a little bit tricked that she didn't tell me even though she admitted she knew it was risky.\n\nSo, she tells me she's pregnant, and I'm completely stunned. I don't know what to do. I have an apprenticeship, so I earn a small wage and still live with my parents. She lives on student loans in student housing. We have no place for a baby. These are my first thoughts. Then I get angry that she didn't tell me we might be at risk, but I don't say anything to her, because I knew I might regret it. A few days later after gathering my thoughts, she asks me what I want to do. She's expressed that she is open to keeping the baby, but she doesn't say whether she really wants to or not. I tell her I don't want the baby. She says she doesn't want to lose me. I tell her I'm not ready, and we get into a little bit of a fight, in which she hints she wants the baby. I know this is a dick move, but I tell her that I can't stay with her if she has the baby because I am not ready at all, and I feel it's not my fault she didn't handle contraception properly. I tell her that if she wants to be a single mom, I'll give her whatever I can afford, but if she wants to stay with me, she will have to abort. She is obviously really upset about this, and I feel like an asshole but I mean it, I'm not ready and I can't look after a child. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of having an abortion does break my heart, but we can't do this now, no way. I do to some extent, love the baby, but I know that's not enough, we don't have the money or the resources. I also love her so much and I am crushed that this has happened, because no matter what happens with the pregnancy I know this is going to impact our relationship. I don't want to lose her but I can't be involved with a baby. My head is all over the place and I don't know what to do.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a young couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. The guy is 18, the girl is 20. They've been dating for seven months and weren't using backup protection because she was on the pill. Now she's pregnant.\n\nFirst, the author is asking if he's at fault for pressuring her to have an abortion. He feels she didn't take the pill properly and didn't use condoms when she couldn't take the pill consistently. He's not ready for a child and is making it clear that if she wants to keep the baby, he can't stay with her. He offers financial support if she chooses to be a single mom but says he can't be part of it otherwise.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here are responsibility in contraception, communication, and the ethical implications of the decision. Contraception is a shared responsibility in a relationship, even if one partner is using it. The girl admitted she wasn't taking the pill as directed, which the author didn't know. But is it fair for him to hold that against her? She's in university, which can be a stressful time with irregular schedules. Maybe she forgot some days, but is that an excuse? Or is it her responsibility to manage it properly?\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't check in with her about whether the pill was working properly. If they were having sex regularly, maybe he should have been using a condom as backup, as that's a common practice. But he assumed the pill was 99% effective and trusted her to take it right. However, he now feels tricked because she didn't inform him of her potential negligence. But in a relationship, should both parties be proactive about contraception? Or is it only the woman's responsibility?\n\nThen there's the abortion decision. The author is giving her an ultimatum: abort or he leaves. That seems harsh. He's not forcing her to have an abortion, but he's making it a condition for staying together. That could be seen as pressuring her, even if he's not directly making the decision for her. It's a tough situation, but is it fair for him to use the pregnancy as a reason to end the relationship if she chooses not to abort?\n\nLegally, in many places, the woman has the right to decide about her own body, so the author can't force her to have an abortion. But ethically, is he being selfish? He's not in a position to support a child, which is understandable. But ending the relationship over this might be a way to avoid responsibility, or perhaps he truly isn't ready. The girl is open to keeping the baby, which complicates things. If he leaves, she's left on her own, which is a heavy burden.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's taking a stand on what he can and can't handle, but the way he's handling it by setting an ultimatum might be where the issue is. He's not considering her feelings as much as his own. The girl might feel pressured, even if he's not forcing her. Also, he's blaming her for the situation, which might not be entirely fair, as both share some responsibility for contraception. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more understanding and for making such a harsh decision.\n"
