I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong. The roommate is implying there shouldn't be a reduction because the author makes more money. The author argues that they already pay more than 50%, have student debt, and that the roommate didn't go to school. They suggested a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent. Typically, roommates split based on income or usage. The author is paying more now because they earn more. If the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the number of people in the apartment increases, which might affect the cost. But the author is arguing that their higher income shouldn't negate the rent adjustment. \n\nThe roommate's argument is that since the author makes more, there shouldn't be a reduction. But maybe the roommate isn't considering that the author already pays more. The author is suggesting a 40-60 split when the roommate's share increases, which could be seen as fair. The roommate being mad might be because they expected to keep paying less, but the author is adjusting based on new circumstances.\n\nAlso, the author's background with student debt and the roommate not having that could add to the perception of unfairness. However, financial responsibilities are personal, and the roommate's girlfriend moving in is a change in household size. Maybe the author is justified in wanting a fairer split based on income. It's about mutual agreement. If they can't agree, maybe they need to renegotiate terms. The roommate not being open to discussion might be the issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a fair adjustment.\n"
