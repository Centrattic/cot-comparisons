I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The author is paying more than 50% now because they make more money. The roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the roommate doesn't want a rent reduction, saying the author makes more. The author is upset because they already pay more, they have student debt from school while the roommate doesn't, and they suggested 40-60 split. The roommate is mad, and the author wonders if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the fairness of the situation. The initial split was based on income, so the author pays more. Now, with the roommate's girlfriend moving in, the rent might stay the same or increase. If the rent stays the same, the author is paying the same amount but the roommate's share would be less if they split equally. But the roommate is opposing a reduction because the author makes more. The author wants a 40-60 split, which is a significant reduction for them. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the rent is the same and the roommate's side is adding another person, it's reasonable for the author to ask for a lower share. However, the initial arrangement might have been based on income. But when the roommate's situation changes (adding a partner), the split might need adjustment. The author's reasoning is that they already pay more, and the roommate's partner is another person, so maybe the rent should be split among three people? Wait, but the original question is about when the girlfriend moves in. If the total rent is the same, but now there are three roommates (the original two plus the girlfriend), maybe the author is asking for a lower share because their roomie's side now has two people. But the roommate is saying that the author makes more, so the split shouldn't change. \n\nThe author's points are valid. They pay more now, have student debt, and the roommate's situation is changing. Suggesting a 40-60 split might be a fair adjustment if the rent is the same, considering the roommate's household is now two people. But the roommate is upset. Is the author overstepping? If the rent is split based on income initially, but now the roommate has a partner, maybe the split should consider the number of people in each side. However, in many roommate situations, splits are based on income or agreed upon. The author is asking for a fairer split given the new circumstances. \n\nThe roommate's argument is that the author makes more, so the split shouldn't change. But if the roommate's side is two people (roommate and girlfriend), maybe the total their side can pay is higher. But the author is suggesting 40-60, which is a big drop for the author. Maybe the roommate is being unfair not to adjust. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for wanting a fair split when circumstances change. The roommate might not be wrong either, but the author's reasoning seems logical. The key is that the author is paying their fair share based on income, and with the roommate's new situation, the split should adjust. So the answer would likely be no, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
