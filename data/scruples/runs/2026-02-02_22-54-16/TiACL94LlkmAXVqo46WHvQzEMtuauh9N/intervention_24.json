I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction is in the wrong when the roommate's girlfriend moves in. \n\nFirst, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, which typically means the original roommate's share of the rent might decrease because there are now two people splitting it. But the original roommate argues that since the user makes more money, there shouldn't be a rent reduction. The user is paying more than 50% already because of their higher income.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they already pay more than half and have more financial responsibilities (student debt), so they want a 40-60 split now. The roommate is upset about this. \n\nI need to consider fairness. When a third person moves in, the standard split usually adjusts. If it's a two-person split before and three people after, the original roommate might expect their share to decrease. The current setup is that the user pays more because they earn more. But adding another person changes the dynamics. \n\nThe user's argument is that they should adjust the split to 40-60. But if the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, maybe the original roommate is now sharing the apartment with his girlfriend, so the user's share should decrease since there are more people. However, the user is saying they already pay more than 50% because of income differences, which complicates things. \n\nIs it fair to adjust the rent split based on income when the number of people changes? Typically, rent is split based on the number of occupants, but in this case, the original split was unequal because of income. Now, with the addition of the girlfriend, the number of people is increasing, which might warrant a new split. \n\nThe user wants to pay 40% and the roommate and girlfriend 60%. But if the roommate is now sharing with his girlfriend, maybe the user should pay less because the total number of people is three. However, the user's argument is that they've already been paying more, so maybe they should still pay a lower percentage. \n\nThe roommate is upset because of the income disparity. But if the roommate's income is lower, maybe the user should still adjust the split. However, the user has student debt and higher educational investment. \n\nThis seems like a matter of perspective. The user isn't wrong for wanting a fairer split based on their financial situation and the new roommate. The roommate might feel that the income should still be a factor, but when someone else moves in, the standard practice is to adjust the split. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They're trying to adjust the split based on the new circumstances and their financial situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
