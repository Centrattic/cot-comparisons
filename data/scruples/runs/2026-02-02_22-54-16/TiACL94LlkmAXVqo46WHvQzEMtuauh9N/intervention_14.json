      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, which means there are now two people living in the apartment. Typically, when someone's partner moves in, it's common to adjust the rent split because there are two people contributing. The original setup was a roommate with a different income, so the split wasn't 50-50. Now, with two people, maybe the split should be adjusted again.\n\nThe author argues that they already pay more than 50% because they earn more. However, when the girlfriend moves in, the roommate is suggesting no rent reduction. The author thinks it's unfair because they have student debt and the roommate doesn't. They propose a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nI need to consider fairness in roommates. If the roommate's partner is moving in, it's reasonable to expect the roommate to cover more of the rent since there are two people there. The original split was based on income, but now the situation has changed. The author's proposal of 40-60 might be fairer if the roommate's side now has two people. However, the roommate might feel that since the author makes more, they should still contribute more. But the presence of the girlfriend might mean the roommate's side can afford a larger share. \n\nStudent debt is a personal factor, but maybe the roommate doesn't have that burden, so the author's argument about that could be a point. But the main issue is the number of people living there. Typically, each person is responsible for their own share. So with two people in the roommate's side, maybe they should pay more. The initial split was based on income, but now it's more about occupancy. \n\nSo, the author is trying to adjust the split based on the new occupancy. If the roommate's side has two people, splitting the rent based on that could be fair. The author's suggestion of 40-60 might be reasonable, but the roommate might not agree. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a fairer split based on the new circumstances. The roommate might be in the wrong for not adjusting for the new number of occupants. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
