      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and the rent split.\n\nThe author wants a rent reduction when the roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate argues against it because the author makes more money. The author currently pays more than 50% because of their income difference. They suggest a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess fairness in roommate agreements. Typically, when a new person moves in, the number of roommates increases, so the rent split might change. If the original two roommates become three, maybe each pays a third. But in this case, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, making it three people. So maybe the rent should be divided into three parts. However, the original roommates had an unequal split based on income. Now, with a third person, does that change things?\n\nThe current setup is that the author pays more because they earn more. The roommate is implying that even with the girlfriend moving in, the author's higher income means the rent split shouldn't reduce. The author thinks it's unfair to continue paying more than half when now there are three people. The author is suggesting 40% (which is a bit less than a third, but maybe considering the roommate and his girlfriend share the 60% as a couple? Or maybe the author is accounting for the three people split differently? Maybe the author is thinking of splitting the rent so that each person contributes according to their income, but when the roommate's partner joins, the original split changes.)\n\nRoommate rights and responsibilities: Generally, when a new roommate moves in, the original agreement might need renegotiation. The fact that the author is paying more now because of income could be a factor. If the roommate's partner is moving in, the total number of people in the apartment increases, which might mean the rent should be split among three instead of two. But if the original two had an unequal split, how does that translate when adding a third person?\n\nThe author's argument is that since they already pay more than 50%, paying even more when the roommate's partner moves in is unfair. The roommate is upset because the author is suggesting a 40-60 split, which might mean the author is paying 40% of the total rent, while the roommate and his partner split 60%. However, if the total rent is now being split among three people, each should pay a third. If the original split was based on income, and now there's a third person, maybe the author's share would be adjusted. But the roommate's partner isn't contributing? That could be a problem. The author is suggesting that the roommate and his girlfriend together pay 60%, so maybe they split that 60% between them. But if the girlfriend isn't contributing her share, the author might end up subsidizing her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the roommate's partner moving in doesn't mean the author should pay the same as before. Since the roommate is now with someone, maybe their combined income is higher, so the author's share should be adjusted accordingly. The roommate's objection is that the author's higher income means the rent shouldn't reduce. But when the roommate has a partner, the household's total income might be higher than the author's, so the author's share should decrease. The author is trying to adjust the split based on the new household dynamics.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the initial agreement. If the initial split was based on income, and now the roommate is bringing in a partner, the author's argument is about fairness in the new situation. The roommate might be resistant to changing the split, but the author's request is reasonable. Since the rental situation is changing, the split should be renegotiated. The author isn't wrong for wanting a fairer split when the circumstances change. The roommate's anger might be due to not wanting to adjust the split, but the author's stance is valid. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
