I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is saying that even though the author pays more than 50% now because they earn more, he doesn't think there should be a rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author argues that since they already pay more than half, and they have student debt while the roommate doesn't, it's unfair for the rent to not be adjusted so the author pays less than 50%. They suggested 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness in splitting rent based on income, and the fact that the roommate's partner moving in changes the dynamic. Typically, when a roommate's partner moves in, it's common to adjust the rent split because there's another person living there, even if they don't pay rent. But in this case, the author is saying they already pay more than half because of their higher income, which complicates things.\n\nThe roommate is implying that because the author makes more money, the rent split shouldn't change. But the author is suggesting that even though they earn more, since there's an additional person moving in (the girlfriend), the rent should be adjusted so the author doesn't end up paying more than necessary. The roommate being upset might be because he feels the author is taking advantage of their higher income to demand a lower share, even though the original split was based on income.\n\nBut usually, when someone moves in with a partner, it's a common practice to re-evaluate the rent split because there's an added benefit (another person using the space). The fact that the author already pays more than half could mean that the current split is based on income, but the presence of the girlfriend might mean the author's share should decrease. The roommate's resistance could stem from not wanting to lose the current arrangement where he benefits from the income-based split.\n\nSo, considering typical roommate agreements and fairness, the author's request seems reasonable. They are adjusting the split to account for the new roommate's presence, even though they earn more. The roommate might be in the wrong for not being open to adjusting the split despite the change in living situation. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
