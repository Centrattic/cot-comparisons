I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The roommate is implying there shouldn't be a reduction because the author makes more money. The author already pays more than 50% because of that, and they're suggesting a 40-60 split now. The roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness in rent splitting. Typically, when someone's partner moves in, the original roommate might expect their share of the rent to decrease since there are now two people sharing the space. But the author is already paying more because of income differences. The roommate is saying that since the author makes more, there's no need for a reduction. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that their higher income is due to education and now they have student debt. The roommate didn't go through that. So the author is trying to adjust the split to account for both the new roommate and their own circumstances. \n\nIs it fair for the author to want a lower share? Well, if the new person is moving in, the original roommate usually gets a break. If the original split was based on income, maybe that's a good system, but if the new person is a roommate, perhaps the split should be adjusted. The author is trying to adjust the split to reflect the new living situation. \n\nThe roommate being mad might be because he expected to keep the higher share. But the author's point is that with the new roommate, the original arrangement isn't fair anymore. So the author is trying to adjust the split to be fairer. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. The key point is that when a new person moves in, especially a partner, the original arrangement should be renegotiated. The author's request for a 40-60 split seems reasonable if the new roommate is part of the household. The roommate's resistance might be because he's not considering the new dynamic. So the answer should be B.\n"
