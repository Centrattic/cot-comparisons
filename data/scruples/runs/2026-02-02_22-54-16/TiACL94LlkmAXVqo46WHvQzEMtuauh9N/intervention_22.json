I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the author wants a rent reduction because they currently pay more than 50% due to making more money. The roommate argues against a rent reduction, saying it's because the author earns more. The author feels it's unfair since they have student debt and went to school, while the roommate doesn't have those financial burdens.\n\nFirst, splitting rent based on income is a common practice when roommates earn different amounts. The author already pays more because they make more, which is fair. Now, with the new roommate, there are three people. The author suggests a 40-60 split, which would mean they still pay less than before. The roommate is upset about this.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the original arrangement was income-based. Adding a third person changes things. The author is adjusting the split to account for the new person. The roommate might feel that since the author earns more, they should still pay a larger share even with the addition. But the author's reasoning is that now there are three people, so the rent should be divided three ways, but the author's share should be less than before. The roommate might not like that because the new person is their girlfriend, and they might want to prioritize their financial situation.\n\nHowever, fairness in this context is subjective. The author is adjusting based on income and the new household size. The roommate's anger could stem from feeling that the author is exploiting the situation. But the author is trying to find a fair split based on their financial realities. The roommate might need to consider that the new person's presence adds another income source, which could affect the rent division. If the girlfriend is contributing, that should be factored in. If not, the original split might need adjustment. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for proposing a new split that accounts for the new household structure and their own financial position. The roommate's resistance might be due to not wanting to reduce the author's share despite the new arrangement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
