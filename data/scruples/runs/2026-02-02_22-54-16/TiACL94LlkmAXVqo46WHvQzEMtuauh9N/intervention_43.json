      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and the rent split. The author wants a rent reduction so they pay 40% instead of more than 50% now. The roommate is upset when the author suggests this. The user says they think the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors here. The original split was based on income, with the author paying more because they earn more. The roommate's girlfriend moving in would mean two people in the apartment, so typically, there's an expectation that the rent would be split equally between the two new roommates. However, the author is arguing that since they already paid more than 50%, the new arrangement should reflect that. \n\nThe roommate is resisting because the author makes more money. The key points here are fairness and the reasons behind the split. Normally, splitting rent based on income can be a common practice, but when a third person (the girlfriend) moves in, the dynamics change. The author is suggesting a 40-60 split, which would mean the author pays 40% and the roommate plus his girlfriend split the remaining 60%. That makes sense because the author is now sharing the space with two people instead of one. \n\nThe roommate's argument is that the author's higher income justifies the current split. But when the number of roommates increases, the standard is usually to split the rent per person. So if there are three people, each should pay 1/3. But the author is suggesting a 40-60 split, which might be a way to adjust for their current higher contribution. However, the roommate is upset, possibly because he thinks the author is trying to get a discount despite earning more. \n\nI need to evaluate if the author's request is reasonable. The author's reasoning is that they are now sharing with two people, so their share should decrease. The roommate's argument is that the author's higher income should mean they pay more regardless. The standard practice is usually equal split per person, so the author might be in the right to adjust the split based on the number of people. The fact that the author has student debt and the roommate doesn't adds another layer, but that's more about their personal circumstances than the fairness of the rent split. \n\nThe roommate might feel entitled to keep the original split because of the income difference, but when the number of roommates changes, the standard is to adjust. The author's request seems reasonable, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I have to make sure there's no hidden factor. For example, if the original agreement was based on income and the author agreed to that, then changing the split now might not be fair. However, the situation is changing, so renegotiating is normal. The roommate's implication that there shouldn't be a reduction because of the author's higher income is questionable. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They are adjusting the split based on the new number of roommates, which is a fair approach. The roommate's upset reaction might be because he doesn't want to adjust the split, which is his own issue. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
