I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the author wants a rent reduction because they currently pay more than 50% due to the roommate's lower income. The author suggests a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent based on income. If the roommate makes less, it's common for the higher earner to pay more. But when the roommate's partner moves in, the household might have combined income. However, the author's point is that they already pay more, and they want the split to adjust so they pay less than the current 50% if the roommate is bringing in more with his girlfriend. \n\nWait, the roommate is bringing in a partner, so maybe the combined income of the roommate and his girlfriend would be higher than the author's alone. If the roommate's side now has two people contributing, maybe the rent should be split based on income, but the author is suggesting a 40-60 split where they pay 40% and the roommate's side pays 60%. That might make sense if the roommate's side has a higher combined income. But the roommate is resisting because the author makes more than him individually. \n\nBut the author argues that they already pay more than 50% now, so if the roommate's side has more people, they should cover more. The roommate is upset because he thinks the author's higher income should mean they keep paying more. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, when a new person moves in, it's reasonable to adjust the rent split. If the roommate's partner is moving in, the household is growing, so the existing arrangement might need to change. The author wants to adjust the split based on current circumstances. The roommate is sticking to the previous arrangement based on their individual incomes, but that might not account for the new income from the girlfriend. \n\nAlso, the author's points about their educational investment and debt could be a factor in their argument for needing to pay less to balance financial responsibilities. However, that might be a personal justification rather than a direct factor in the rent split. \n\nI think the core issue is whether adjusting the rent split when household circumstances change is fair. The author is trying to adjust based on the new household structure, which is reasonable. The roommate's resistance might stem from not considering the new combined income of his side. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a fairer split based on the new situation.\n"
