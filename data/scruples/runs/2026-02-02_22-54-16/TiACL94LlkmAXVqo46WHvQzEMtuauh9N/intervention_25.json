I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is implying that the rent split shouldn't change because the author makes more money. The author argues that since they already pay more than 50% and have student debt, it's unfair to not adjust the split to 40-60.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent when a third person moves in. Typically, when someone moves in, the rent might be split equally among all roommates, but that depends on the situation. The author is currently paying more than 50% because they earn more. Now, with the roommate's girlfriend joining, the author wants to adjust the split so they pay 40% and the other two split 60%. The roommate is upset about this.\n\nThe key points here are: existing unequal split, financial responsibilities, and fairness. The author has a higher income and student debt, while the roommate doesn't. The roommate's girlfriend moving in could change the dynamics. If the rent is split equally among three people now, the author would be paying a third, which is less than the current 50%, which might be what the author is aiming for with a 40% split. But the roommate feels that the existing income disparity should be maintained, which the author disagrees with.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the original split was based on income, maybe that's a valid reason. But when a new person moves in, it's common to reassess. The author's request to adjust the split seems reasonable because the financial situation has changed. The roommate's argument that income difference shouldn't affect it might be a bit short-sighted, considering the author's financial obligations. So, the author is probably not in the wrong here. They're trying to adjust the split to reflect the new living arrangements and their own financial responsibilities. The roommate might be resistant because he's used to the current setup, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
