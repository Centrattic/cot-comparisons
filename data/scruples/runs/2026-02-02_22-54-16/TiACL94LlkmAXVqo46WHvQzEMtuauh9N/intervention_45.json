He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate whose girlfriend is moving in, leading to a request for a rent reduction and a new split.\n\nFirst, the original split was unequal because the author makes more money. Now, with the roommate's girlfriend joining, the author suggests a 40-60 split. The roommate is upset because he feels the author should still pay more due to higher income. \n\nThe key points here are fairness and the initial agreement. The original arrangement was based on income disparity. When a new person moves in, the dynamics change. Typically, when a third person joins, the split might be adjusted to three ways, but here it's a two-person household with a new roommate. \n\nThe author's argument is that the new situation (three people living there) should mean a different split. The roommate, however, is clinging to the previous income-based split despite the new circumstances. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the original split might have been based on income, but with the addition of a third person (the girlfriend), the financial responsibility should logically be adjusted. It's common for roommates to adjust their split when there are changes in the household. The author is proposing a more equal split (40-60) which is reasonable if the third person is contributing. But the roommate is resisting, possibly because he doesn't want to account for the new person or is being unfair about the income aspect. \n\nThe author isn't demanding a lower rate just because the roommate has a girlfriend, but because the household structure has changed. The original split was already unequal, so adjusting it when the situation changes makes sense. The roommate's anger might stem from not wanting to adjust or not considering the new roommate's contribution. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to adjust the split fairly based on new circumstances. The roommate's resistance seems to be based on an outdated premise (income disparity) without considering the new person's presence. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
