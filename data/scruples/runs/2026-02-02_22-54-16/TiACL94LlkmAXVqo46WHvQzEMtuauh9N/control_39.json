He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate whose partner is moving in, and the original poster wants a rent reduction.\n\nFirst, the roommate pays more than 50% because they earn more. Now, the roommate's partner is moving in, and the roommate says there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the original poster makes more. The poster wants to adjust to a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nSo, fairness is a big part here. The original split was based on income, which is a common way to split rent. When the roommate's partner moves in, the dynamics change. The poster argues they should pay less than 50% now, but the roommate isn't willing to reduce the rent because of the income difference.\n\nThe key points are: the original split was based on income, the student debt, and the fact that the roommate's income is lower. The poster is suggesting a new split, which the roommate resists. \n\nI need to consider whether adjusting the rent split when someone's partner moves in is fair. Typically, when a partner moves in, the rent might be split differently because there are two people sharing the space. However, in this case, the original split was unequal because of income. Now, with the partner moving in, the total number of people is three? Wait, wait. Wait, the original poster is a roommate, and the roommate's partner is moving in. So initially, there were two roommates, and now there are three people: the original poster, the roommate, and the roommate's partner. So maybe the rent should be split among three people now? But the original poster is only one person. So if the partner moves in, the roommate and partner could split their share, but the original poster is still paying more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original rent was split between two people, and now with the partner moving in, the three of them need to decide a new split. The original poster is saying that since they earn more, they should still pay a certain percentage, but the roommate is resistant. The poster suggests 40-60, meaning the roommate and partner together pay 60%, which would be a 30% each if split equally. But maybe that's not fair because the roommate and partner could combine their income to pay more, while the original poster's higher income allows them to pay more. \n\nBut the problem is that the original poster is asking for a reduction in their share, even though they were already paying more. The roommate is upset because the income disparity still exists. The poster's reasoning includes the fact that they have student debt and the roommate doesn't. \n\nIs it fair for the poster to want a rent reduction? If the roommate's partner is moving in, perhaps the rent should be adjusted to account for three people. But if the rent is the same as before, the poster is paying the same amount as before, which might be more than their share now that three people are living there. However, the original poster might be paying more because their income is higher. \n\nIn typical roommate situations, rent is split based on income or equal shares. Here, the original split was income-based. When a new person moves in, the split might need to be recalculated. The poster is suggesting a new split, but the roommate is resistant. The roommate's argument is that since the poster makes more, they should still pay more. The poster wants a lower percentage because now there are more people, but the roommate isn't conceding. \n\nSo, is the poster in the wrong? If the roommate and partner are moving in, and the total number of people increases, the rent should be adjusted. If the rent is split based on income, the poster's higher income would still mean they pay more. However, if the new arrangement is that there are three people, perhaps the rent should be split differently. The 40-60 split the poster suggests would mean the roommate and partner pay 60%, which might be fair if their combined income is higher. But if their combined income isn't higher, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the poster might be right to want a lower share because they're only one person now sharing with three others. But the roommate's argument is that the income disparity justifies the higher share. \n\nI think the key here is whether the rent split should be based on income or on the number of people. If it's based on income, the poster's higher income justifies a higher share, regardless of the number of roommates. But if it's based on the number of people, then the poster would pay less since there are more people. \n\nIn this case, the original split was based on income. The poster is now suggesting a different split because of the number of people. The roommate is upset because the income consideration is still relevant. \n\nI think the poster is not in the wrong because renegotiating the rent split when the living situation changes is reasonable. However, the roommate might feel that the income should still dictate the split. But since the situation has changed with the addition of a partner, the poster is justified in wanting a new agreement. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
