I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The roommate is splitting the rent based on income, and the author makes more, so they pay more than 50%. The roommate's girlfriend moving in would add another person, but the roommate doesn't think there should be a rent reduction because the author makes more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard roommate agreements regarding rent splitting. Typically, when someone moves in with their partner, the rent might be adjusted if there are more people contributing. The author's current arrangement is based on income, which they already pay more because they earn more. \n\nThe author is suggesting a 40/60 split after the girlfriend moves in, meaning the author pays less. The roommate is upset because they feel the author shouldn't get a reduction just because of the income difference. \n\nI should check if there's an existing agreement. If they had a prior agreement that splits rent based on income, then adding another person might require renegotiating. The author's argument is that since they pay more now, adding another person should adjust the split. \n\nBut the roommate might feel that the income-based split is already fair and that adding a partner shouldn't change the existing terms. However, the addition of another person could mean more shared expenses or responsibilities. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the roommate's partner moving in changes the living situation, so the rent split should reflect the new setup. The roommate is resisting because they think the income difference should remain the basis. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about what's agreed upon. If the original split was based on income and the roommate agreed to that, then the author is within their rights to ask for a new arrangement when circumstances change. The roommate not wanting to adjust might be the issue here. \n\nThe key points are: existing agreement, fairness based on income vs. number of people, and mutual agreement. Without a prior agreement, the author has a valid point in wanting a fair split based on the new situation. However, if the original split was income-based, the author might be overstepping by reducing their share just because of the roommate's partner moving in. \n\nWait, but the original arrangement already had the author paying more because of higher income. If the roommate's partner moves in, they might expect to contribute, which could mean splitting the rent 50/50 among three people, but the author is suggesting 40/60. That might not account for the new person. Alternatively, if the roommate and his partner are both contributing, perhaps the author's share should be adjusted considering three people. \n\nThe author's request might not account for the new roommate (the girlfriend) contributing. If the author wants a 40% share, but there are now three people, the calculation might be different. The author could be assuming the girlfriend isn't contributing, but if she is, then the split should include her. \n\nSo, if the author is asking for a 40% share without considering the new roommate's contribution, maybe that's unfair. But if the author is considering that the roommate and his partner will split the rent, then 60% between two people would be 30% each, and the author pays 40%. But the original split was based on income, not people. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. The main issue is whether the author has a right to change the split when the roommate's partner moves in. The author's reasoning is that the current split is based on income, and with more people, the split should adjust. However, the roommate might think that the income-based split should remain regardless of the number of people. \n\nIn many cases, roommates adjust rent when there's a change in the household, so the author isn't wrong for wanting to renegotiate. But the specific fairness depends on the situation. If the author's original agreement was to pay more due to higher income, but now there are more people, it's reasonable to ask for a new arrangement. The roommate's refusal might be the issue here. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to adjust the rent split when the circumstances change. The roommate is being unreasonable by not wanting to adjust despite the change. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
