      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is the asshole. The scenario is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and wanting a rent adjustment. The original poster (OP) is paying more than 50% of the rent because they earn more. The roommate is suggesting the rent won't be reduced, and OP wants to split it 40-60 instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles of fairness in roommates. Typically, when two people split rent, it's common to split it evenly unless there's a specific reason to do otherwise, like different incomes. In this case, OP already pays more because they earn more. Now, with the roommate's girlfriend moving in, OP is suggesting a 40-60 split, which would mean the roommate and his girlfriend together pay 60%. But the roommate is upset because OP is still making more.\n\nWait, the OP is arguing that since they already pay more, it's unfair to not adjust the split when the roommate's partner moves in. The roommate might feel that since OP has a higher income, they should continue paying a larger share. The user is asking if OP is wrong for wanting a more equal split.\n\nI think the key points here are: 1) The current split isn't 50-50 because of income differences. 2) Now, with the new roommate (girlfriend), OP wants to adjust the split so that each person pays an equal share, but since there are three people now, maybe? Wait, no, the original situation is two roommates. When the girlfriend moves in, there are three roommates. But the OP is suggesting a 40-60 split between themselves and the original roommate (who now has a girlfriend). So the total would be split between three people? Or is the total rent just split between the two original roommates, with the girlfriend not contributing? That seems odd. If the girlfriend is moving in, she should also be contributing to the rent. But the OP's problem is that the roommate is saying there's no rent reduction, implying that the total rent remains the same but maybe the split between the two roommates changes. But if the girlfriend is moving in, perhaps the total rent goes up because they need a bigger place? Or maybe the rent stays the same, but there's a different split.\n\nWait, the original post says: \"He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money than he does.\" So maybe the total rent will stay the same, but there's a new roommate. If the total rent remains the same, but there are now three roommates, then the rent should be split three ways. However, the original roommate is suggesting that OP continues to pay more because they make more. But OP is saying that they already pay more than 50% and now want a 40-60 split between themselves and the original roommate (so that the original roommate and his girlfriend together pay 60%), which would mean the original roommate's share is 30% (since the girlfriend would presumably pay half of the 60%, making it 30% each? Or maybe the original roommate and his girlfriend split the 60% between them). This is a bit unclear.\n\nBut the main issue is fairness. OP is arguing that since they already contribute more, it's unfair to not adjust the split when the roommate's partner moves in. The roommate is upset because OP is still making more. The user wants to know if OP is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of fairness, when roommates have different incomes, it's common to split the rent proportionally. However, if the roommate's girlfriend is moving in as a third roommate, the rent should be split among three people. But if the total rent remains the same, and OP is already paying more than 50%, then adding a third roommate would mean the total rent is now split among three. However, the OP is suggesting a 40-60 split between themselves and the original roommate, which might not account for the third person. Alternatively, if the rent is split among three, OP might be paying more than their share, leading to the OP's request for a more equal split.\n\nBut the key point here is that OP is trying to adjust the split to be fairer given their higher income and educational investment. The roommate is resisting because OP's higher income should mean OP continues to pay more. However, if the new roommate is part of a couple, maybe they expect to split the cost between them. The fairness of the split depends on the agreements and how the rent is divided. If the original split was based on income, then perhaps the new arrangement should also consider income. However, if the new roommate's presence means the total number of people is three, then each should contribute equally unless there's a different agreement.\n\nIn this case, OP is suggesting a 40-60 split between themselves and the original roommate, which might not be fair if the original roommate is now sharing with his girlfriend. If the OP is paying 40% and the original roommate plus girlfriend split the remaining 60%, that would mean each of them pays 30%. But since OP has a higher income, maybe it's fair for OP to pay more than 30%. However, the OP's argument is that they already pay more than 50%, so with the new split, they'd pay 40%, which is less than they did before but more than their fair share if split three ways. This is confusing.\n\nAnother angle: The roommate's girlfriend is moving in, so the total number of roommates increases from two to three. Therefore, the rent should be divided by three. If OP is already paying more than 50% of the two-roommate split, moving to a three-roommate split would require OP to pay less than their previous share. However, if the total rent remains the same, but there are three people, then each should pay roughly 33.3%. If OP is currently paying more than 50% (say 60% of the two-person rent), then when split three ways, OP would pay 60% / 3 = 20%, which is less than 33.3%, so that seems unfair. Therefore, maybe OP is justified in wanting a different split where the total per person is adjusted based on income. This is getting complicated.\n\nThe main question is whether OP is in the wrong for wanting a rent reduction (or adjustment) when the roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is upset because OP makes more money. The user is asking if OP is the asshole.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, the rent should be split among three people. If the original split was based on income (50-50 plus a little more because OP earns more), then introducing a third person complicates things. However, if the total rent is the same and there are three people, each should pay roughly 33%. But if the original split was more than that for OP, then OP is paying more than they would if split three ways. Therefore, OP might have a valid point in wanting to adjust the split to a 40-60 between themselves and the original roommate, which would mean the original roommate and his girlfriend pay 60% together (each 30%), and OP pays 40%, which is more than 33.3% but less than the previous 50-50. Alternatively, maybe OP wants to split the total rent three ways, but the roommate is resisting. The confusion here is about how the split should be adjusted when adding a third roommate.\n\nGiven the information, OP is trying to adjust the rent split to be fairer when the roommate's partner moves in. The roommate is upset because OP still makes more money. The OP's argument is that since they already pay more, it's unfair to not adjust the split, and they want a 40-60 split. The roommate is mad about this. The user is asking if the OP is in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, if the original split was based on income, and now with a third roommate, the split should be adjusted, then OP is not in the wrong for wanting a fairer distribution. However, if the roommate expects OP to continue paying a larger share due to income, but OP is trying to adjust for a three-way split, then OP might be justified. The key is whether the split is fair considering the new roommate and income differences. Since the OP is trying to adjust for fairness, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
