I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when wanting a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in.\n\nThe roommate is implying there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author already pays more than half due to their higher income. They suggest a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nHmm. The initial split was based on income, which is common. When someone moves in, the rent structure usually changes. The author is adjusting the split to account for the new person, which makes sense. The roommate might feel the income difference should still dictate the split, but the presence of a third person changes things. The author isn't wrong to want a more balanced split when someone else is contributing. The roommate's resistance could be because they don't want to pay less despite the new person. So the author's stance seems reasonable. Answer B.\n"
