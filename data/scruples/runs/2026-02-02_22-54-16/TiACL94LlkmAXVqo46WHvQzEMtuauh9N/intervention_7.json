      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the original roommate (the author) is paying more than 50% because they make more money. The author suggests a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset. The author's reasoning is that since the roommate now has a partner, the rent should be adjusted. The roommate argues that because the author earns more, the rent shouldn't be reduced.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness in rent splitting. When someone moves in, it's common to adjust the rent. If two people are roommates, splitting 50-50 is standard, but if there's a third person, maybe it's split three ways. But in this case, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, so the total number of roommates increases by one. Wait, but the original setup was two roommates. If the girlfriend moves in, that makes three people. So the rent would typically be split three ways. But the author is suggesting that they pay 40% and the two others (roommate and his girlfriend) split 60%. That's a 40-30-30 split. \n\nBut why would the author be paying less than 50%? If there are three people, each would usually pay around 33%. The author is suggesting they pay 40%, which is more than a third, but less than the original 50%. The roommate is upset because he thinks the author should still pay more because they earn more. \n\nThe author's argument is that since the roommate's income is lower, and they already paid more than 50%, adding another person should allow for a reduced share. The roommate's counter is that the author's higher income justifies not reducing the rent. \n\nIn terms of fairness, income can be a factor. If one roommate earns significantly more, it's common to have an unequal split. But when a third person moves in, the usual approach is to split the rent among three. However, the author is suggesting a different split based on income. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the original agreement was based on income, then changing the split when a new roommate (girlfriend) moves in could be seen as reasonable. The author's request is to adjust the payment based on the new number of roommates and their income. The roommate might be resistant because they don't want to reduce the author's share, but the author is just trying to adjust the split to be fair given the new circumstances. \n\nThe roommate might be in the wrong for not considering the new dynamics. The author's request seems fair if they want to split the rent based on the number of people or adjust for income. However, if the original agreement was strictly income-based, maybe the author is right to adjust the split when the number of roommates increases. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid point about the increased number of roommates and the existing income disparity. The roommate's anger might be unwarranted. So the answer should be B.\n"
