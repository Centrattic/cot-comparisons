I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a Reddit-style post is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The roommate currently pays less because the author makes more money and has student debt, while the roommate doesn't. Now, with the girlfriend coming in, the author wants to adjust the split to 40-60 instead of 50-50.\n\nFirst, fairness in roommates usually depends on income and usage. The author is already paying more because they earn more. The roommate is implying that the rent share shouldn't change even though there are now three people in the apartment. The author's argument is that they have higher expenses (student debt) and invested in their education, which affects their financial situation. \n\nThe roommate is upset when the author suggests a 40-60 split. The key points here are about fairness based on income and responsibility. If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, that adds another person, so maybe there's an expectation of more contribution. However, the author is already paying more than half. The roommate might feel that the rent should stay the same because the author's higher income justifies it. But the author argues that it's unfair to continue this split when there are three people. \n\nIn roommate situations, splitting rent equitably often considers each person's income and contributions. The author's reasoning is logical: their higher expenses and investment in education mean they need a fairer split. The roommate's grievance is about income disparity but not considering the new dynamics. The author isn't wrong in seeking a fair division, especially if the roommate's partner is now a resident. The roommate's anger might stem from not wanting to pay more, but the author's proposal is based on current circumstances. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
