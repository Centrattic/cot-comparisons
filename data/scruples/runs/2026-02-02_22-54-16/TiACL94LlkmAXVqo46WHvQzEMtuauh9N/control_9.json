      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is implying there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author makes more money, but the author is already paying more than 50% due to higher income. The author suggests a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, the initial agreement was a 50-50 split based on income differences. If the roommate's girlfriend moves in, that changes the living situation. Typically, when a new person moves in, the rent is adjusted because there are more people sharing the space. So the author wants to adjust the split because the roommate is now sharing the space with someone else, which might mean the author should pay less since there are two roommates instead of one. \n\nBut the roommate is resisting because the author makes more money. However, the author already pays a larger share because of higher income. The roommate's argument seems to ignore that the financial responsibility is already shifted towards the author. The author is suggesting a 40-60 split, which would mean the author pays less than before, which is fair considering the new roommate. \n\nThe roommate being mad might be because he didn't expect a change in the rent split just because his income is lower. But the presence of the girlfriend adds another person who will presumably share the space and maybe the costs. So the author isn't wrong for wanting to adjust the rent split to reflect the new living situation. The roommate's implication that the author should still pay more because they earn more doesn't account for the fact that now there are two people in the room. \n\nAlso, considering the author's student debt and the roommate's lack of debt, the author is in a different financial position. The author's reasoning seems fair. The roommate might be in the wrong for not considering the change in the number of people sharing the rent. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
