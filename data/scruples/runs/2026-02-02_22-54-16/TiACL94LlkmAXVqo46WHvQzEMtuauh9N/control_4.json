I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong. The roommate is suggesting no rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author argues they already pay more than 50%, have student debt, and want to adjust the split to 40-60. The roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, fairness in roommate agreements can vary. If the current split is based on income, maybe it's fair. But when a new person moves in, typically the rent would be adjusted. However, the roommate is saying that the author's higher income means no reduction. The author thinks that's unfair because they already pay more and have financial obligations from their education.\n\nThe roommate's girlfriend moving in might mean the household has more people, so splitting rent equally could make sense. But the author's argument is about their existing financial situation. If the rent is being split based on income, and the author is contributing more, maybe adjusting the split when another person moves in is reasonable. The author wants a fairer split considering their student debt and higher income. The roommate being mad might be because they expected to keep the current arrangement, but maybe the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a more equitable arrangement. So, likely answer B.\n"
