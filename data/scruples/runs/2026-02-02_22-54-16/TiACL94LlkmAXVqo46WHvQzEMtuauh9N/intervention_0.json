I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong. The roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the author wants a rent reduction. The key points are that the author currently pays more than 50% because they earn more, and they suggested a 40-60 split. The roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness. When someone moves in, typically the rent is divided based on how many people there are. If there were two roommates and one moves out, the remaining person would take over the full rent. But here, the situation is the opposite: the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, so the rent should be split among three people. However, in some cases, people might split the cost between the two roommates equally, even if one has a guest, depending on the agreement.\n\nThe author currently pays more because they earn more. If the girlfriend moves in, maybe the rent should be divided as two people per room, but that's not specified. The user argues that since they already pay more, adding another person should adjust the split. They suggested 40-60. The roommate is mad because they think the author should still pay more due to higher income.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, typically, when a new roommate moves in, the rent is split among all occupants. If the girlfriend is considered a roommate, then the three people would split the rent. But if the girlfriend isn't paying, it's a different scenario. However, the original split was between two roommates, not accounting for the girlfriend. The author is adjusting based on the new situation. The roommate's argument that income should still affect the split might not be valid if the new arrangement is about occupancy rather than income. So the author's request for a 40% share could be fair. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
