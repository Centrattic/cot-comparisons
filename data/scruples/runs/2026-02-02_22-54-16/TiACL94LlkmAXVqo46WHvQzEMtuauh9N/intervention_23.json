I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and rent splitting.\n\nFirst, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, which usually affects the rent structure. The author currently pays more than 50% because they make more money. They proposed a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset. The author argues that since they already pay more, and have student debt, it's unfair not to adjust the split when the roommate has a guest. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, rent splitting is often based on income or agreed-upon terms. The author's reasoning is that if the roommate's partner is moving in, the rent should be adjusted. The roommate is resisting because the author makes more, but that's part of the existing arrangement. The author is suggesting a more even split, which seems reasonable since the roommate now has a guest. \n\nBut maybe the roommate and his girlfriend are both contributing, so the total income increases. However, the author's point is that they should split the rent equally or adjust based on the new numbers. The roommate's issue is that the author earns more, but the author is paying less in their proposal. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're asking for a fair adjustment based on the new living situation. The roommate might be resistant because he's used to the current arrangement, but the situation has changed. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
