I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and a rent split issue. \n\nFirst, the roommate is making the author pay more than 50% because the author earns more. Now, with the girlfriend moving in, the author wants the rent to be adjusted to 40-60, but the roommate is upset. The author feels it's unfair because they already pay more than half, have student debt, and the roommate doesn't. \n\nI need to figure out if the author is wrong. Let's break down the points. When roommates split rent, it's common to adjust based on income or other factors. The original split was based on income differences, so when the roommate's partner moves in, the dynamics change. The author is suggesting a 40-60 split, which would mean the author pays less than before. \n\nThe roommate's argument is that since the author makes more, there shouldn't be a reduction. But the author is arguing that with two people in the room, the rent should be split more evenly. The key here is whether adjusting the rent when a new person moves in is reasonable. \n\nTypically, when a new roommate moves in, it's expected that the rent split might change. If the original split was unequal due to income, but adding another person, maybe the split should be adjusted. However, the roommate might think that since the author already pays more, they shouldn't get a discount. \n\nBut the author's point is that they already paid more than 50% before. If the new roommate is moving in, the split should be adjusted to reflect the number of people. For example, if three people are in the apartment, the author might pay a third, but the author is suggesting a 40% split. That seems reasonable. \n\nThe roommate might be upset because they don't want to reduce the author's contribution, possibly because they think the author should still pay more due to higher income. But when a new person is added, the per-person cost usually goes down, so adjusting the split to a 40-60 (totaling 100%) makes sense. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They're asking for a fair adjustment based on the new situation. The roommate's resistance might stem from the fact that they're used to the author paying more, but if the new partner is contributing, then the author should pay less. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
