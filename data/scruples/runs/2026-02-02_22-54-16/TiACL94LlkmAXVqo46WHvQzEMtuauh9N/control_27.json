I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants a rent reduction when the roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong. The roommate currently splits the rent with a 50-50 split but the user pays more because they make more money. Now, with the girlfriend moving in, the user wants to adjust the split to 40-60, but the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial arrangement. If they were splitting rent based on income, then the user was already paying more. Now, the roommate's partner is moving in, which changes the living situation. Typically, when a new person moves into the space, it's common to adjust the rent split to account for the additional person, even if they don't take a room. The user's argument is that since they already pay more, the new split should reflect the three people sharing the space. However, the roommate argues that since the user makes more money, the existing split isn't fair. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that their higher income and student debt make it unfair to not adjust the split. The roommate is upset because the user is suggesting they pay less. The key here is the original agreement. If the original split was based on income, adding another person might require a new arrangement. But if the roommate's partner is moving in and contributing to the household, the user's argument for a 40-60 split makes sense. \n\nBut there's also the social aspect. Roommates might have different expectations. The user might feel entitled to a lower share because there's more people, but the roommate might think that since the user makes more, they should still pay a larger portion. The user is asking if they're the asshole for wanting to reduce their share. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the roommate's partner is moving in and contributing to the household, it's reasonable to adjust the rent. However, if the roommate is not reducing the user's share because of their income, the user's request is about fairness in splitting costs based on current circumstances. The roommate might be resistant because they feel the user's higher income should still mean they pay more, but the user is asking for a more equitable split given the new setup. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they're asking for a fair adjustment based on the new living situation. The roommate's resistance is based on the user's income, but the presence of a third person should ideally lead to a different split. So the answer would be B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
