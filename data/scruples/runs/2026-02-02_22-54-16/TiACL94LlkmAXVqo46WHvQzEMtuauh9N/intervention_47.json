I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in, and the original poster wants a rent reduction because they currently pay more than 50% due to earning more. The roommate is implying no rent reduction even with the new person, and the poster suggested a 40-60 split.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the fairness here. Rent splits are typically based on several factors: income, how much each person contributes, and the arrangement agreed upon. The poster already pays more because they earn more, which is a common way to split costs when incomes differ. But when the roommate's girlfriend moves in, it's a change in the living situation. The poster is asking for a different split because now there are two people, so maybe the rent should be split among three? But the poster is suggesting 40-60, which could be considering their income and the new roommate's presence.\n\nThe roommate is upset because the poster is asking for a reduction. The poster argues it's unfair to pay more than 50% when there's another person. The roommate's side is that since the poster earns more, maybe the rent split isn't based on equal shares. But traditionally, when more people move in, the rent per person might decrease, unless the new person is covering their own share. If the girlfriend is coming in, the original two roommates might need to adjust their split. If the roommate and his girlfriend are two people, maybe they should cover the entire rent, and the original poster pays less. But the poster is suggesting 40-60, which could be a way to factor in their different incomes.\n\nThe key points are: existing unequal split, new roommate moving in, and a proposed new split. The poster's reasoning is that with more people, the rent should be split differently. The roommate is mad, possibly because he's not considering the new dynamic. The poster's argument seems reasonable. They are adjusting the split based on the new living situation. The roommate's implication that no reduction is needed because the poster earns more might not be fair. Typically, when more people move in, the per-person cost decreases, so the original poster paying less makes sense. The fact that the poster has student debt and the roommate doesn't might not directly affect the rent split, but it could influence their ability to pay. However, the main issue is the number of people in the household. \n\nI think the poster is not in the wrong because they are asking for a fairer split when the living situation changes. The roommate is resistant without considering the new arrangement. So the answer should be B.\n"
