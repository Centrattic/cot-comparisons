I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the author wants a rent reduction. The roommate is saying there shouldn't be any reduction because the author makes more money. The author currently pays more than 50% because of their different incomes. Now, the author wants to adjust the split to 40-60, so they pay 40% and the roommate and his girlfriend split the 60%. The roommate is upset about this.\n\nHmm, the main point here is fairness in splitting the rent when the living arrangement changes. The author argues that since they've already paid more than half based on income, it's unfair to not adjust when the roommate's partner moves in. The roommate seems to think that because the author earns more, they shouldn't get a reduction. \n\nI think the key is whether splitting the rent equally makes sense when the number of people in the room changes. Normally, when a new person moves in, especially if it's a partner, it's common to adjust the rent split. So maybe the author is right to want a change. However, the roommate is arguing that income should determine the split. But the author's higher income is already factored into the current split. If the roommate's partner moves in, there are three people sharing the space, so the author might not see as much benefit as before. \n\nAlso, the author mentions education and debt, which might be a point about financial responsibility. The roommate didn't go to school and has no debt, so maybe his financial obligations are lower. But does that matter in the rent split? Not sure. The main issue is how the rent is divided when there's a change in the number of roommates. \n\nThe author suggested a 40-60 split, which would reduce their share. The roommate is mad because he thinks the author should still pay more. But if the split is based on income, maybe the author's higher income is already accounted for. If the roommate and his partner have lower incomes, they might need to pay less. But the author's point is that they already pay more than half, so when another person joins, their share should decrease. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. They're trying to adjust the split fairly based on the new situation. The roommate is being unreasonable by not considering the change in roommates. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
