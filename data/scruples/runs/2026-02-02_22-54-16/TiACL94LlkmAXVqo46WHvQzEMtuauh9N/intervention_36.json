I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The roommate is implying no rent reduction despite the current split being unequal. The author already pays more than 50% because they earn more. They suggest a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, the current arrangement is that the author pays more because of higher income. The roommate's girlfriend moving in would likely increase the household's combined income, so it makes sense the author might want a lower share. The roommate's argument that the author should still pay more because they earn more seems to ignore the new dynamic. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on fairness considering their higher educational investment and debt. They want a more balanced split post-move-in. The roommate being mad might be because he's used to the current setup and doesn't want to adjust. But if the total rent is the same, splitting it differently based on income changes is reasonable. The roommate's stance seems rigid without considering the new circumstances. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're adjusting the split logically. The roommate's resistance is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
