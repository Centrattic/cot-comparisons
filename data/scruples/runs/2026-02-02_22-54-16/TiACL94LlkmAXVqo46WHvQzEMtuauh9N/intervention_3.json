I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2.

I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a roommate whose girlfriend wants to move in, and the author wants a rent reduction because they already pay more than 50% due to making more money. The roommate is against a rent reduction, saying it's because the author makes more. The author argues that they should split the rent 40-60, which is less than 50-50, but the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent based on income. Typically, roommates split rent equally unless there's an agreement otherwise. The author is paying more because they earn more, which might be a separate arrangement they had before. Now, when a new person moves in, the dynamics change. The author wants to adjust the split because with three people, they would be paying less than 50% if the rent is split three ways. But the roommate is resisting because the author's higher income is a factor.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they already pay more than their share when there were two people, adding a third should adjust the split. But the roommate is arguing that the author's higher income doesn't justify a reduction. The key points here are about fairness in splitting costs and whether income should affect that.\n\nIn most roommate situations, splitting rent equally is standard unless everyone agrees to a different arrangement. The author's initial arrangement (paying more due to higher income) was a mutual agreement. Now, with the third person, the author is asking to adjust the split, which the roommate is opposing. The roommate's frustration might come from the idea that the author is changing the agreement or expecting a lower share now that there are more people, even though the author's income is higher.\n\nBut wait, if there are three people, the rent would be split three ways. If the current rent is split 50-50 between two people, adding a third person would mean each pays a third. However, the author is suggesting paying 40%, which is less than a third (approx 33.3%). That's more than the 33.3% each would pay if split equally. So the author is actually proposing to pay more than their share in a three-person setup. But the roommate is mad because they thought the author would pay 50% as before, but now the author wants to pay 40%.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The original arrangement was 50-50 between two people. The author pays more than 50% because their income is higher. Now, if the roommate's girlfriend moves in, making three people, the author is suggesting paying 40% (author and roommate together pay 60%). But normally, with three people, each should pay around 33.3%. So the author is proposing to cover 40%, which is more than their share, while the roommate and their girlfriend would cover the remaining 60%. But the author is asking the roommate to agree to this split, which the roommate is resisting because the author makes more money. The roommate might think that since the author's income is higher, they should still pay a larger portion. The author, however, wants to adjust to a 40-60 split because of the new person, even though the author is paying more than their third.\n\nHmm. The author's argument is that because they already pay more than their share when there were two people, adding a third should adjust the split. But in reality, when there are three people, the fair split would be 33.3% each. The author is trying to reduce their share further to 40% (which is actually more than 33.3% of the total rent) but from the roommate's perspective, maybe they're not seeing it that way. The roommate is mad because the author is asking to pay less than 50% when there are three people, but the author is actually paying more than their fair share in that scenario. Wait, maybe the confusion is in how the percentages work. If the original rent was split 50-50 between two, then total rent is X. Now, adding a third person would mean splitting into three. If the author wants to pay 40% of the total rent, that's 40% of X, which is more than 33.3% of X. So the author is actually paying more than their share in the new setup. But the roommate is mad because they thought the author would still pay 50% (i.e., X/2) now split into three, but the author is reducing their share to 40% (which is X*0.4), which is less than X/2. So the roommate might feel like the author is trying to get out of paying as much as before, even though the author is still paying more than their fair share in the new setup.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the rent is to be split equally among three people, each should pay approximately 33.3%. The author's proposed 40% is actually a larger portion than that, but they want the roommate to take 60% as a combined share with the girlfriend. The roommate's girlfriend would presumably split their 60% with him, maybe 30-30? But the author isn't accounting for the girlfriend's presence in the split. The standard approach is that when someone moves in, everyone splits the rent equally unless there's an agreement. The author is trying to adjust based on income, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's argument is that since they already paid more when there were two people, adding a third should justify a different split. However, the roommate is resisting because the author's higher income doesn't automatically mean they should still pay more when there are three people. The key point is whether splitting rent based on income is fair. Typically, roommates split equally unless they agree otherwise. If the original arrangement was based on income, but now with a third person, that arrangement might need renegotiation. The author is asking for a fair adjustment, but the roommate is upset that the author is trying to reduce their share from 50% to 40%, even though the fair split would be 33.3%. The author is actually paying more than their fair share in the new setup, so they might be in the right. The roommate's frustration might be misplaced because the author is trying to adjust the split to a fairer distribution given the new roommate. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
