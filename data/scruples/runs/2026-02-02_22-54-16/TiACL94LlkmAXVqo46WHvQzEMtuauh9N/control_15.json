I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong. The roommate is splitting rent unevenly because they make more money, and the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, so the roommate doesn't want to reduce the rent. The user argues that since they already pay more than 50% and have student debt, they should adjust the split to 40-60. The roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, the initial split wasn't equal because of income differences. That's a common situation where roommates adjust rent based on ability to pay. Now, when the roommate's girlfriend moves in, does that change things? Well, if the new person is living there, they might be taking up space or resources, so the rent split could be adjusted. The user wants to pay 40% because the roommate is bringing someone in. But the roommate is against a reduction because the user makes more.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Let's consider fairness. If the roommate is adding another person, that's an extra person in the house, which could mean more usage of shared spaces, utilities, etc. So it's reasonable for the user to expect a lower share. The roommate's argument that the user makes more is valid if the split is based on income, but when another person moves in, the split can shift. The user's reasoning is that the roommate is bringing in someone else, so the user shouldn't have to pay more than half. The roommate is upset because they think the user should still pay more due to higher income.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong here. The roommate bringing in a partner could justify a different split, especially if the user is contributing more and has other financial burdens. The user's request to adjust the split to 40-60 is a reasonable attempt to balance the new living arrangement. The roommate's refusal might be because they feel the user's higher income should offset the new person, but that doesn't account for the user's debt and the change in household dynamics. So the answer would be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
