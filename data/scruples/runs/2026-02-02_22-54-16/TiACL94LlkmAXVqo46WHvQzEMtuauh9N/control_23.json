      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the author wants a rent reduction. The roommate says there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author argues that they already pay more than 50% and that they have student debt from going to school, while the roommate doesn't. The author suggested a 40-60 split, but the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness in splitting rent. Typically, if someone moves in with a partner, the rent might be split among more people. But how does that affect the existing split? If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, that makes three people sharing the rent. So maybe the original 50-50 split between two people would now have to be adjusted. However, the author is paying more than 50% already because they earn more. So the initial split wasn't equal per person but based on income.\n\nThe author suggests a 40-60 split, meaning the roommate and his girlfriend would cover 60%, and the author 40%. If the total rent is the same, the author is reducing their share. But maybe the roommate is paying more than before because he's now splitting with his girlfriend. Wait, if the roommate has a partner, maybe the per-person cost decreases. For example, if the total rent is $3000, originally each paid $1500. If the roommate and his girlfriend split the $3000 equally, each would pay $1500, but since there are two of them, maybe each pays $1000? Wait, no, that would be splitting three ways, but the original split was two people. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is arguing that since the roommate now has a partner, the rent should be split three ways. But the author is already paying more than 50%, so maybe they want to adjust the split so that each person (three people) pays an equal share. Wait, if there are three people, each paying an equal share would mean each pays a third. If the author is currently paying more than 50%, moving to a third would be a decrease. So the author is asking for a lower share because there's an extra person contributing. That makes sense. But the roommate is arguing that because the author makes more, the split shouldn't change.\n\nBut the roommate's logic might be flawed. If the rent is being split among three people, then each should pay an equal share, regardless of income. However, sometimes people split based on income. The author is saying that they already pay more because they earn more, but now with three people, they want to reduce their share. The roommate is upset because he thinks the author should still pay more due to higher income. Is that fair?\n\nAlso, the author mentions student debt from going to school, implying that the roommate didn't go to school. But does that matter in terms of splitting rent? Maybe not directly, unless the roommate has a higher income which allows him to pay more. But the author is paying more because they earn more now.\n\nThe key here is whether splitting rent based on income is the norm. If the original split was based on income, then introducing a third person might require a different approach. If the roommate and his girlfriend are splitting their share, then maybe each of them pays half of their total share. If the author is paying more than 50% already, then moving to a 40% share would mean the new couple pays 60% together. If the roommate and his girlfriend split the 60% equally, each would pay 30%, making the total per person 50% for the author, 30% for the roommate, and 30% for the girlfriend. That would mean the author's share is reduced from over 50% to 40%, which is fair if there's an extra person contributing.\n\nBut the roommate is upset. Maybe he feels that the author is trying to exploit the situation by reducing their share despite earning more. However, if the new setup involves three people, it's logical to adjust the split. The author isn't necessarily wrong in wanting a more equitable split based on the number of people. The roommate's argument that income should dictate the split might not hold when there's an additional person involved. So the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
