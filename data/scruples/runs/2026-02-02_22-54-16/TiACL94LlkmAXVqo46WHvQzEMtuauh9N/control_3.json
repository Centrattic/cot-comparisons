      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the original poster (OP) wants the rent split differently because they currently pay more than 50% due to earning more. The roommate is suggesting no rent reduction because OP makes more, but the OP thinks it's unfair and wants to adjust to 40-60, which upsets the roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent based on income versus equal splits. Typically, roommates might split rent equally unless there's a specific reason to adjust, like different room sizes or utilities. However, in this case, the roommate's girlfriend moving in might change the living situation. Maybe there's more people in the house, so the cost per person could decrease. But the roommate is arguing against a reduction because OP earns more, which seems odd because usually, the income might affect who pays more, not the total split.\n\nThe OP is paying more than 50% now because they earn more. If the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the total number of people increases, but the total rent remains the same. So, if the roommate and his girlfriend are now two people, and OP is one, maybe the rent should be split among three people? Wait, but the original split was between two roommates. If the girlfriend moves in, maybe the roommate and his girlfriend will cover the rent together, and OP's share could decrease. That's a possible scenario.\n\nThe OP suggests that if the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, they should adjust the split so that OP pays 40% and the other two (roommate and girlfriend) pay 60% combined. The roommate is not happy with that. Let me think about standard roommate arrangements. Normally, when someone else moves in, it's the people sharing the space who adjust their split. So if the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, perhaps the roommate and his girlfriend decide how they split their portion, and OP continues paying the same as before. But the OP is arguing that since the total number of people increases, the rent should be split differently. \n\nBut traditionally, roommates split the total rent among all roommates, not accounting for other people in the household unless they're co-tenants. If the girlfriend is a new roommate and becomes a tenant, then there are three tenants, so the rent could be split three ways. However, if the girlfriend is not a tenant but just a guest, then the original split between the two roommates remains. But the problem here is that the roommate is bringing in a partner, which might imply that they are sharing the space more, so the rent split might need adjustment. \n\nThe OP's reasoning is that because they earn more and already pay more, it's unfair to not adjust when the roommate's income is lower. But if the roommate's income is lower, maybe the original split was based on income. Now, with the roommate having a partner, perhaps the combined income of the roommate and his girlfriend is higher than OP's, but that's not mentioned. The OP is suggesting a 40-60 split, which would mean OP pays less, which the roommate is against because OP earns more. \n\nAnother angle: If the roommate is bringing someone in who will be living there, the total number of people increases, which might mean the rent is split among more people. However, if the girlfriend is not a tenant, then the original split between the two roommates should stay unless the roommate and his girlfriend decide to take on the full rent together. The OP's issue is that the roommate is implying no rent reduction, but the OP wants a reduction because there are more people. \n\nThe key points are: 1. The current split is based on income. 2. The roommate wants to keep the same split because OP earns more. 3. The OP wants a new split because there are more people. \n\nTraditionally, roommates split rent equally unless there's a specific reason. If the roommate's partner is not a tenant, then the original split should remain. But if the roommate's partner becomes a tenant, then the three split the rent. However, if the roommate is just adding someone to live there without adding them as a tenant, that might be a problem. \n\nThe roommate might be assuming that the rent is split between him and the OP, and the girlfriend is just a guest. So the OP is asking for a reduction because there are more people, which might be reasonable. But the roommate is resisting because the OP's income is higher. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the rent is being split equally regardless of income, then the OP was already paying more. But maybe that was a previous arrangement. Now, with the addition of a roommate's partner, the split should change. However, if the OP wants a reduction because there are more people, but the roommate is not adding the girlfriend as a tenant, then the OP's request might not be valid. \n\nAlternatively, if the roommate is bringing someone in who will be living there, then the rent should be adjusted. For example, if the roommate and his girlfriend are now two people in the house, they might take on a larger portion of the rent. But if the original split was based on income, maybe that's complicating things. \n\nIn terms of the question, \"Am I the asshole?\" the user is asking if they're in the wrong. The roommate is upset because the OP wants to adjust the split. The OP's reasoning is that since there are more people, the split should change. The roommate thinks that because the OP earns more, the split shouldn't change. \n\nIf the roommate's partner is not a tenant, then the original split between the two roommates remains. If the roommate is adding someone who becomes a tenant, then the three should split the rent. The OP's suggestion of 40-60 might be a way to adjust for the additional person, but the roommate is resistant because of income differences. \n\nIn the end, whether the OP is in the wrong depends on the existing agreement. If the initial agreement was to split based on income, and the roommate is now changing the situation by adding someone, the OP might be justified in wanting a different split. However, if the roommate is not adding the partner as a tenant, then the OP's request might be considered unreasonable. \n\nThe answer is likely B (No), because adjusting the split when there's a change in the number of people sharing the space is reasonable, and the roommate might be in the wrong for not considering that. However, if the roommate's partner isn't a tenant, then the OP's request could be seen as unfair. But the scenario doesn't clarify if the girlfriend is becoming a tenant. Given the information, the OP is asking for a fair adjustment due to more people, so the answer is B.\n"
