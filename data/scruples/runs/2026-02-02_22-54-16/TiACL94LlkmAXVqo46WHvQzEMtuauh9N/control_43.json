      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and a disagreement over rent splitting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The roommate's girlfriend is moving in, and the roommate is implying there shouldn't be a rent reduction. The author argues that they already pay more than 50% because they earn more, so when the girlfriend comes, they want to adjust the split to 40-60. The roommate is upset. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting this adjustment.\n\nLet me break down the key points. The author pays a higher share now because they earn more. The roommate didn't go to school and has no debt. The author has student debt, so maybe that's a factor in why they want a lower share when the girlfriend moves in. The roommate is resistant to changing the split even with the new roommate. \n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that when there are three people, maybe the rent should be split three ways. But since they want to pay 40% (which is 1/3 plus a bit more?), maybe they're considering that the roommate's girlfriend is an additional person, but the author is still paying more. The roommate, however, is not willing to adjust, thinking maybe the author should keep paying more because they earn more. \n\nIs the author's request fair? Rent splitting can be tricky. Typically, when a new roommate moves in, the rent is divided among all roommates. However, some people split based on income. The author is arguing that since they already pay more now due to higher income, the new situation should adjust accordingly. \n\nBut when the girlfriend moves in, that's a third person. If the rent is split equally, each would pay 1/3. The author is suggesting they pay 40% (which is 1/3 + 1/3 * 0.5?), which isn't exactly standard. Maybe the author wants to account for the fact that the roommate's income is lower, so the split should be 40-60 between the two existing roommates, considering the new third person. Wait, maybe the total rent would be split between three people. The author is saying that the roommate and his girlfriend (two people) should pay 60%, and the author 40%. So three people paying, but the roommate's side (two people) pays 60% in total, which would mean each of them pays 30%, and the author 40%. That's a bit unusual, but perhaps they're considering the roommate's lower income.\n\nThe roommate is upset because the author is proposing a split that might not account for the original roommate's higher income. The roommate's argument is that since the author earns more, the rent shouldn't be adjusted. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the original split was based on income. The author might be assuming that when the third person moves in, the split should be adjusted to account for everyone's income, leading to a different distribution. However, typically, when a new roommate moves in, the rent is divided equally unless there's a prior agreement. The author is changing the split based on income again, but the roommate might feel that the original arrangement should stay if the new roommate is also part of the equation.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to pay less than 50% now because there are three people. But if they were already paying more than 50% with two people, adding a third might mean they should pay less. However, the calculation here is a bit unclear. If the total rent is split into three, and the author is paying 40%, that's 40/30=1.33 times what each of the others would pay. Maybe the author is considering that the roommate's girlfriend is another person, so the two people (roommate + girlfriend) should pay more because they're two people. But that's not typical unless there's a specific agreement. Usually, each person pays an equal share.\n\nThe author's argument that they have student debt while the roommate doesn't might not be a valid reason to adjust the rent, but it's a personal factor they're considering. The roommate's main issue is that the author is changing the split again, and the roommate might feel it's unfair to reduce the author's share just because there's a third person.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the rent is split equally among all roommates, the author should pay 1/3. If the author wants to pay less than that, maybe they're expecting the roommate to take on more of the rent. But if the rent isn't being adjusted down overall (i.e., the total rent remains the same but split into three), then the author is suggesting a different distribution. However, without prior agreement, changing the split based on income might be seen as the author trying to get a better deal, which could be unfair to the others.\n\nSo, depending on the existing agreement, the author might be wrong to unilaterally decide the split. If the original arrangement was income-based, then adding a third person might require a new agreement. The roommate might feel that the author is exploiting their higher income to get a lower share now. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the standard approach of splitting equally or negotiating a fair split without referencing income as much.\n"
