I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The roommate is implying there should be no rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author currently pays more than 50% due to their higher income but wants to adjust the split to 40-60.\n\nFirst, the roommate's argument is that since the author makes more, the rent shouldn't be reduced. But the author is paying more now because they earn more, which is a contributing factor to the current split. If someone else moves in, typically the rent gets adjusted. The roommate is suggesting the author keeps paying a higher percentage, which might not be fair if the new person is sharing the space.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that even though they make more, the presence of the girlfriend should mean the total rent is split differently. The 40-60 split would account for the new person. The roommate is upset, but the author's stance is about fairness based on current circumstances. \n\nIn many roommate situations, when a new person moves in, the rent is adjusted to include them. The original split might not account for that. The author isn't asking for a lower split based on income alone but on the new living arrangement. So, the author's request is reasonable. The roommate's resistance is because they want to maintain the current setup, but that might not consider the new roommate's presence. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
