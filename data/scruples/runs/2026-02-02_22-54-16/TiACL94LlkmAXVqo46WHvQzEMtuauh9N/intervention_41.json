      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction after their roommate's girlfriend moves in. \n\nFirst, the roommate is making them pay more than 50% because they earn more money. Now, when the girlfriend moves in, the roommate's share of the rent would presumably be split between him and his partner. The author wants the rent split so they pay 40% and the roommate and his girlfriend cover 60%. The roommate is upset because he thinks the author should still pay more since they earn more and have student debt.\n\nHmm. Rent splitting can be tricky. Typically, people split rent based on income or agreed-upon terms. If the roommate is bringing in a partner, the financial responsibilities might change. The author's argument is that since the roommate's living situation is changing (adding someone else), the rent division should adjust. \n\nThe roommate's implication is that the author should continue paying a larger share because of their higher income. But the author feels that's unfair now that there are two people in the other room. They want a more equal split. \n\nIs it fair? Well, if the roommate's partner is moving in, it's reasonable to expect that the roommate might cover more, especially if they have shared expenses. The author's point about their own student debt and higher income being a factor in their original split is valid, but when the roommate's circumstances change, adjusting the split makes sense. \n\nThe roommate being mad might be because he doesn't want to reduce his share, but the author has a good case for wanting a fairer distribution given the new roommate. So, I don't think the author is in the wrong here. They're advocating for a fair split based on the new situation, which is reasonable.\n"
