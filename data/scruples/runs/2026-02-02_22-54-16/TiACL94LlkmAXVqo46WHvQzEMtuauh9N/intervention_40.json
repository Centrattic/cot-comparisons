I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the roommate is suggesting that the rent shouldn't be reduced even though the author pays more than 50% now because they earn more. The author argues that since the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, the rent structure should adjust. They proposed a 40-60 split, which would mean the author pays less, but the roommate is upset.\n\nThe key points here are fairness and contribution. The author currently pays a larger share due to higher income, but when the roommate has a partner moving in, the dynamic changes. Typically, when a new person moves in, the rent is split among more people. However, since the girlfriend is moving in with the roommate, it's possible that the roommate's share of the rent would effectively decrease because there are now two people living in the space. The author is trying to adjust the split to reflect that new arrangement.\n\nThe roommate's argument that the author's higher income should mean no rent reduction doesn't seem fair. The split should probably be based on the number of people using the space rather than individual incomes, especially if the original agreement was based on a 50-50 split adjusted by income. When a third person moves in, the split should ideally be recalculated to account for three people. However, if the girlfriend is considered a roommate, the split might be three ways. But since the original split was adjusted because the author earns more, maybe the new split should consider that the roommate's share is now split between him and his girlfriend, so the author's share might decrease.\n\nThe author's proposal of 40-60 is a way to adjust for the new living arrangement. The roommate being mad could be because he's not used to the idea of his share increasing or the author getting a lower percentage. But the author's reasoning is based on the change in the number of occupants and fairness in contribution relative to income. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to adjust the rent split based on the new circumstances, which affects how the rent is divided among roommates. The roommate's resistance might stem from not wanting to pay more, but the author's approach is about fairness in light of the new living situation.\n"
