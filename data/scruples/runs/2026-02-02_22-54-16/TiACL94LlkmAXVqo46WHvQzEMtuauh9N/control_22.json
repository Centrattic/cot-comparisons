I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong. The roommate is implying that there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author argues that they already pay more than 50% due to higher income, have student debt, and the roommate doesn't. They proposed a 40-60 split, which upset the roommate.\n\nFirst, fairness in rent splitting usually depends on the agreement between roommates. If the current split is based on income, which it seems, then adjusting that when another person moves in is a common issue. The author is suggesting a new split because the roommate's partner will be there, potentially increasing the number of people in the house. However, the author's main points are about their own financial situation versus the roommate's. \n\nThe roommate argues against a reduction because the author makes more, but the author believes that since they already pay more, adding another person (the girlfriend) should adjust the split. The 40-60 proposal is a way to account for three people living there, maybe. But the roommate is upset because the author's higher income is being considered again. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the original agreement was based on income, changing it when another person moves in could be reasonable. The author isn't necessarily wrong to ask for a reduction if the living situation changes. The roommate's stance that income shouldn't affect the split might be the issue here. The author is trying to adjust the split fairly considering the new person and their own financial burden. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
