I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The key points here are the current rent split and the author's reasoning.\n\nRight now, the author pays more than 50% because they earn more. Their roommate is saying that even if the girlfriend moves in, the rent shouldn't be reduced because the author makes more. The author argues that since the roommate's income is lower, they should adjust the split so that the author pays 40% and the roommate plus girlfriend cover 60%. The roommate is upset about this suggestion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent based on income. Typically, roommates split rent based on income or other factors, but when someone else moves in, the dynamics change. If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, the household size increases, which might justify a lower overall rent split for each person. However, the author is suggesting a specific split that reduces their share, which the roommate is unhappy with.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes two main points: they pay more now because they earn more, and they have student debt while the roommate doesn't. They feel it's unfair not to adjust the split when the roommate's financial situation (with a lower income) is combined with someone else's. The roommate, on the other hand, might feel that the author's higher income should still mean they pay a larger portion, even with the new roommate.\n\nI need to assess if adjusting the split for income differences is fair. In some cases, splitting rent based on income is considered fair, especially if it's agreed upon. However, when a new person moves in, the original agreement might not account for that. The author is proposing a new split that considers the roommate's income and the new household size, but the roommate is resistant, possibly because they see the author's higher income as a reason to maintain the existing split.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're asking for a change based on fairness, considering income and financial responsibilities. However, if the roommate isn't open to renegotiating the split due to the new circumstances, the author's request might be seen as reasonable. Alternatively, the roommate might feel that the author is taking advantage of the situation. The key here is whether both parties had an agreement beforehand and if the author is acting in good faith by proposing a new split based on current circumstances.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of the roommate's girlfriend moving in. Typically, when a new person joins, the rent might be split among more people, but in this case, the original two roommates are adjusting the split. The author's argument is that with the new person, the split should be adjusted to reflect the different income levels. However, the roommate might think that since the author already pays more, the new dynamic shouldn't change that.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to adjust the split based on fair sharing of costs, considering income differences. The roommate's resistance might stem from not wanting to reduce the author's share despite the new household structure. So, the answer would be B for No.\n"
