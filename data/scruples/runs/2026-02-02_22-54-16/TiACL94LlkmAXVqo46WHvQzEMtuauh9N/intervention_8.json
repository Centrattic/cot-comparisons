      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate whose girlfriend is moving in, and the original poster wants a rent reduction. They already pay more than 50% because they earn more. The roommate doesn't think there should be a rent reduction despite the new roommate.\n\nThe key points are the existing split, the reason for wanting a change, and the roommate's reaction. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, the current split is based on income, which is a common way to split rent when roommates have different earnings. The author is paying more because they earn more. Now that the roommate has a partner moving in, the author wants to adjust the split so they pay 40%, and the roommate plus his girlfriend split 60%. That's a 40-60 split, which seems fair because the roommate and his girlfriend are two people, and the author is one. Typically, splitting based on the number of people is another common method. \n\nThe roommate is upset because he feels the author should still pay more due to higher income. However, bringing in a new roommate (the girlfriend) should ideally mean adjusting the rent split. The author's argument is that the new roommate should contribute, which is reasonable. The roommate's implication that the author should still pay more because of their income might be unfair, especially if the new roommate is also contributing.\n\nThe author's points about their student debt and the roommate's lack of debt is a bit of a personal gripe but not necessarily relevant to the rent split. The main issue is the fairness of splitting rent when there are more roommates. \n\nIn many cases, when someone moves in, the existing roommate might expect a lower share. The author is suggesting a split based on the number of people (1 vs 2), which is logical. The roommate's refusal to adjust might be the issue here. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're asking for a fair split when the roommates increase. The roommate's resistance could be the problem. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
