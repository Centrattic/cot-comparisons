I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and the rent split.\n\nFirst, the roommate is splitting rent 50-50 even though the author pays more because they earn more. Now the girlfriend is moving in, and the roommate doesn't want a rent reduction, but the author thinks they should adjust the split. They suggested 40-60, with the roommate and his girlfriend covering 60% and the author 40%. The roommate is upset.\n\nThe author's points are that they pay more already, have more student debt, and the roommate doesn't. They feel it's unfair if the split doesn't change. Is the author wrong?\n\nWell, when roommates' circumstances change, like someone moving in, it's logical to adjust the rent split. The original split was based on income differences. Adding a third person (the girlfriend) might mean the household can cover more of the rent. The author is suggesting a new split based on the new situation. The roommate not wanting to adjust because the author earns more might not be fair, especially if the new person's income is considered.\n\nBut maybe the roommate feels the author is exploiting the income difference. However, the author isn't asking for a rent increase, just a fairer split based on the new household's total income. The roommate's anger might come from not wanting to adjust the split, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author is trying to adjust for fairness. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
