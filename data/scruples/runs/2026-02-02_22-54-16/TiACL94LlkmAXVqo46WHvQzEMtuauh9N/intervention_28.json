I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is suggesting that even though the author currently pays more than 50% because they earn more, the rent shouldn't be adjusted when the girlfriend comes in. The author is upset because they already pay a larger share, have student debt, and want the rent split 40-60 in favor of the new setup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical roommate agreements. Usually, when someone moves in, the rent split might change based on the number of people or other factors. Here, the author is already paying more than half, which is a current agreement. The roommate's girlfriend moving in adds a third person, which could mean the rent is now split among three people. But the author wants the split adjusted to 40% for them and 60% for the couple. The roommate is upset, thinking the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe key points are the income disparity and the existing payment structure. The author has a higher income and student debt, which affects their financial situation. The roommate has a lower income and no debt. The author argues that since they already pay more, adding another person shouldn't require them to pay even more. The roommate, however, might feel that since the author earns more, they should contribute more regardless of the new arrangement.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's subjective. If the original agreement was based on income, adjusting it when a third person moves in could be tricky. The author is trying to adjust the split to account for the new living situation, while the roommate is sticking to the income-based split. The roommate's argument is that the author's higher income means they should pay more, even with the new person. However, the author sees the new arrangement as three people splitting the rent, so they want their share reduced to 40% even though they earn more. \n\nLegally, there's no set rule here. It's mostly about mutual agreement. The author isn't obligated to agree to the roommate's terms, but the roommate is also within their rights to not agree to the 40-60 split. The main issue is whether it's fair to adjust the rent split when a third person moves in. The author's reasoning is that they already pay more, so adding someone else should reduce their share, but the roommate might see it as the author still needing to pay a larger portion due to higher income.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons for wanting a more equitable split based on the new living arrangement. The roommate's frustration might stem from the idea that income should dictate the split, but the author is focusing on the change in household composition. So the answer is B (No).\n"
