      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted on AITA is in the wrong. The situation is about rent splitting with a roommate whose girlfriend is moving in, and the roommate doesn't want a rent reduction despite the poster already paying more than 50% because they earn more.\n\nFirst, the poster argues that they already pay more (because they make more money) and that they have student debt from higher education, while the roommate doesn't. The roommate is implying that the girlfriend moving in doesn't mean the rent should be adjusted downwards, but the poster thinks they should split it 40-60 in their favor. The roommate is upset about this.\n\nTo determine if the poster is in the wrong, I need to consider fairness, prior agreements, and typical roommate dynamics. Usually, roommates split rent based on factors like income, needs, or space used. The original split was unequal because of income differences. When the roommate's partner moves in, the poster might feel that the additional person should contribute, so the rent split should adjust.\n\nBut here's the catch: if the roommate's partner is moving in, perhaps the roommate is expecting the poster to take on more of the rent because the partner isn't contributing. However, the poster is already paying more than 50%, which was the original arrangement. The poster's request to adjust to 40-60 when the partner joins is because the total number of people increases, so the rent should be split among three people. But the roommate is resistant because the poster makes more.\n\nIs the poster wrong to ask for a lower share? Well, the key is whether the original agreement was based on income, and if adding another person changes the dynamics. If the original split was 50-50 but adjusted because the poster earns more, then maybe the new split should consider three people. However, the poster is suggesting they pay 40%, which is even less than the original 50% split. The roommate might feel that since the poster earns more, they should still pay more, even with three people. \n\nBut the poster's argument is that since the roommate's partner is moving in, the total number of people increases, so the rent should be split as 33.3% each, but the poster offers 40% to account for the roommate's higher contribution if needed. However, the roommate is upset because the poster wants to pay less than 50%, maybe because they perceive that their own income is lower. \n\nIn typical roommate situations, when a new person moves in, the existing roommates might adjust their splits. If the poster was already paying more due to income, but the new person doesn't contribute, it's understandable to want a split that reflects the increased number of people. However, the roommate might feel that since the poster earns more, they should still bear a larger portion. \n\nThe poster isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking for a fair adjustment. The roommate's resistance could be because they don't want to reduce their share, but the poster's reasoning is based on fairness considering the new dynamic. The key factors are whether the original split was based on income and if adding a third person necessitates a new arrangement. The poster's request is reasonable, so the answer would be B (Not the asshole).\n"
