I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The roommate is splitting the rent with a 50-50 split, but the author pays more because they earn more. The roommate says there won't be a rent reduction, but the author wants to adjust the split to 40-60, which upsets the roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the current arrangement. If the original split was based on income, that's one thing. But if it's a flat split, then when another person moves in, it might require renegotiation. The roommate's girlfriend moving in would increase the number of people in the apartment, so maybe the rent should be adjusted. However, the roommate isn't reducing the amount the author pays. Instead, the author is suggesting they pay less because the roommate is now sharing with more people.\n\nThe key points are: the author already pays more than 50% because of higher income, they have student debt, and they argue that the current split isn't fair when the roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is upset because the author wants a different split. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to adjust the split based on the new situation. The original arrangement was unequal due to income differences, and when a new person moves in, it's reasonable to renegotiate. The roommate's resistance might be because they're used to the current split, but the author's reasoning is valid. So the answer should be B.\n"
