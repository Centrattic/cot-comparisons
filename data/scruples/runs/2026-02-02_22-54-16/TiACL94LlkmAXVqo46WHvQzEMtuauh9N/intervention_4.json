      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is implying there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author currently pays more than 50% due to higher income and wants to adjust the split to 40-60, which the roommate is upset about.\n\nFirst, the initial split: they're splitting rent based on income, which is common. The roommate's girlfriend is moving in, so the household is expanding. If the rent is reduced, the author wants to adjust their share to 40% since there are now three people. But the roommate is resistant because the author earns more. \n\nThe author argues they have student debt and higher education, implying the roommate doesn't. The roommate's grievance is about fairness based on income. But when someone else moves in, the original split might need adjustment, especially if the rent goes down. The author isn't asking for a lower share just because they earn more, but because the household composition is changing. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The roommate's argument is that since the author makes more, they shouldn't get a lower percentage. But the author's point is that the new arrangement (three people sharing the rent) would mean each person's share should be adjusted, possibly equally. The author's suggestion of 40-60 is a way to still account for income but with the new household size. The roommate might be upset because he's used to the current arrangement and not wanting to change it, even if the situation has changed. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the total rent is going down, splitting it 50-50 between two people and then adding a third person complicates things. The author's request is reasonable if the rent is now being split among three people. The roommate might not want to adjust the split because he's used to the original 50-50 or current arrangement. However, the author has a valid point about their higher income leading to paying more, but when the household dynamic changes, the split should reflect that. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're adapting to a new situation where the rent structure changes. The roommate's resistance might be due to not wanting to adjust the split, even though the circumstances have changed. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
