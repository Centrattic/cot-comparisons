      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is the asshole for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is saying there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author argues they already pay more than 50% because of their higher income and wants to adjust the split to 40-60 if the girlfriend moves in. The roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting rent based on income. Typically, roommates split rent equally unless there's an agreement otherwise. If the roommate's girlfriend moves in, that's a new person in the house, so maybe the rent structure changes. But the original question is about the fairness of adjusting the split.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they already pay more (due to higher income), it's unfair for the new person's arrival to not adjust the rent so the author doesn't pay more than 50%. They suggested 40-60, which would mean the roommate and his girlfriend cover more. The roommate is mad because he thinks the author should maintain the current higher percentage because they earn more.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the original split was based on income, maybe that's a valid approach. But if the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, that's a new situation. Normally, adding someone might mean splitting rent differently. However, if the author is already paying more than 50% because of income, and the roommate is suggesting no reduction, that might be unfair. The author might think the new person should contribute, but if the roommate is covering the girlfriend's share, then the original split could be adjusted.\n\nThe roommate's argument is that because the author makes more, they should continue to pay more. But if the roommate's income is lower, maybe the author is already subsidizing the rent. If the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the roommate's financial situation could change, but that's not directly the author's responsibility. The author's request to adjust the split to 40-60 is a reasonable attempt to balance things if the roommate's side is now covering an additional person.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They're trying to adjust the split based on the new living arrangement. The roommate might be resistant because he's used to paying less, but the author's argument about fairness given their higher income and student debt is valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
