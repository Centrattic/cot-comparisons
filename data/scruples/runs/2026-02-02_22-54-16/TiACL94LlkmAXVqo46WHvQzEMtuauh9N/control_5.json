I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is wrong for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in.\n\nFirst, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The original situation is that the rent is split unevenly because one person makes more money. The author is paying more than 50% because they have a higher income. Now, when the girlfriend moves in, the roommate doesn't want the rent to be reduced for the author because of their higher income, but the author feels that if there are three people, the rent should be split differently, like 40-60. The roommate is upset about this.\n\nSo, the key points are: the current split is based on income, but when a third person moves in, the dynamics change. The author is suggesting a new split because the roommate's income is lower, and the author has higher income and student debt. The roommate is not okay with this.\n\nI need to consider fairness here. In roommate situations, splitting rent can be based on income, but when a new person moves in, maybe the number of people sharing the space is a factor. If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, that might mean the couple is now sharing the space together, so maybe the rent should be adjusted. The author argues that they already pay more, and with three people, the split should change. The roommate is mad because they think the author's higher income shouldn't affect the split when a third person is added.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're asking for a fair adjustment based on the new living situation. The roommate's argument is that the author's higher income should still be considered, but maybe when there's a third person, the number of occupants matters. If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, perhaps the rent should be adjusted so that each person's share is based on both income and the number of people. The author's suggestion of 40-60 might be trying to account for the three people in the roommates' side and the author alone. But maybe the roommate thinks that since the author is still one person, the split should adjust differently. \n\nAlternatively, the initial split was based on income, but with three people now, maybe the income should still be a factor. If the author is making more, maybe they can still pay more, but the presence of two people from the other side might mean that the total rent per person is lower. But the author is suggesting a 40-60 split, which might be fair if the roommates combined their incomes. However, the roommate is upset because the author is asking for a lower percentage despite having higher income. \n\nIt's a bit of a complex situation, but the author is trying to adjust the split to account for the new roommate. The roommate might feel that the original arrangement (based on income) should still hold, but the author is arguing that the addition of a third person changes things. So whether the author is wrong depends on how the split is determined. If the original split was agreed upon and now the new person is added, the author is trying to renegotiate, which is reasonable. The roommate's anger might be because they didn't expect the split to change despite the new person. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's common to adjust splits when circumstances change, like when someone moves in or out. The author is asking for a fair adjustment, so they might not be in the wrong. The roommate's issue is that the author's higher income is a factor, but maybe the author is right to adjust for the new living situation. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
