      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a rent reduction when the roommate's girlfriend moves in is in the wrong. The roommate is saying there shouldn't be a rent reduction because the author makes more money. The author is upset because they already pay more than 50% and want to adjust to 40% for themselves and 60% for the roommate's side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices in roommates splitting rent. Usually, when someone moves in, it's common to adjust the split, even if the rent stays the same. If the roommate's girlfriend moves in, that's two people living in the space, so maybe they should take on a larger share of the rent. The author's argument is that since they already pay more, adding another person should shift the split further in their favor.\n\nBut the roommate is upset because the author's higher income. However, the original split was based on income, but when a new person moves in, that might not be the main factor. The presence of more roommates typically affects the split more than individual incomes. The author is suggesting adjusting the split to 40-60, which makes sense if the roommate and his girlfriend are two people sharing the space, hence a larger share.\n\nThe roommate being mad might be because he's used to the current arrangement and doesn't want to change it even though circumstances have changed. The author isn't wrong for wanting a fairer split given the new living situation. Also, the fact that the author has student debt and the roommate doesn't might be a point, but the main issue is the number of people in the household. So, the author is trying to adjust for the new reality, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
