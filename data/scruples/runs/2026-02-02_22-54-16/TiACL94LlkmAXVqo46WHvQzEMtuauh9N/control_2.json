      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The roommate is implying that since the author makes more money, there shouldn't be a rent reduction.\n\nFirst, the author currently pays more than 50% because they earn more. The roommate's girlfriend moving in would typically mean splitting the rent into three people, but the author wants to adjust the split to 40-60 between them and the roommate, not considering the girlfriend. The roommate is upset about this.\n\nHmm, the author's reasoning is that since they pay more already and have student debt, it's unfair to not adjust the split. But when someone moves in, usually the total rent is divided among all roommates. If the girlfriend is moving in, maybe the total rent would be split three ways. But the author is suggesting a 40-60 split between them and the roommate, not including the girlfriend. That might not make sense because the new person would be part of the household. So maybe the author is not considering the third person in the calculation. The roommate might be mad because the author isn't splitting the rent with the new person, keeping the roommate's share the same. Alternatively, maybe the author is just adjusting their share with the roommate, thinking the roommate's share would cover the girlfriend. But that might not be fair to the roommate. \n\nAlso, the author's points about income and student debt are personal reasons but don't necessarily justify the 40-60 split when the roommate's partner is moving in. The roommate could argue that the presence of a partner doesn't change their contribution unless the rent is split among three. The author might be in the right in wanting to adjust the split based on income, but if the new person is part of the household, the author's approach might be flawed. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider splitting the rent with the new roommate (the girlfriend) and instead tried to adjust the existing split between them and the roommate. That could be seen as unfair, leading the roommate to be upset. Therefore, the answer would be A, meaning the author is the asshole.\n"
