      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate's girlfriend moving in and a proposed rent split.\n\nFirst, the roommate's girlfriend wants to move in. The original poster (OP) currently pays more than 50% of the rent because they earn more. The roommate is suggesting no rent reduction even with the girlfriend moving in, while OP wants to adjust the split to 40-60 (OP paying 40%). The roommate is upset about that.\n\nThe user wants to know if OP is the asshole (AITA). The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider fairness in roommate agreements. Typically, when someone else moves in, the rent is split among more people. However, in this case, the roommate's girlfriend is moving in, so maybe the existing roommates' share should decrease. But since OP is already paying more than 50%, maybe they think the new arrangement should adjust accordingly. \n\nThe roommate's argument is that OP makes more money, so they should still pay a larger share. But OP argues that since there are now two people in the room's share, the split should be adjusted. The key here is whether the initial split was based on income or just equal division. If it was based on income, then with two people sharing the room, maybe the income ratio should still be considered, but split between them. \n\nAlternatively, if the rent is split based on roommates, and the roommate's GF is now part of the room's share, OP might be justified in wanting to reduce their share. However, the initial setup might have been a 50-50 split adjusted because OP earns more. Now with two people in the other room, maybe the split should be reevaluated. \n\nBut the roommate is not considering the change in the number of people contributing. If the original split was based on income, perhaps the new arrangement should factor in the new roommate (GF) as a separate entity. However, the GF isn't a roommate in the traditional sense unless she's also paying rent. If the GF isn't paying rent, then the room's share is still the same, but now two people are living in that room. That might be an issue. \n\nWait, the original split was OP paying more than 50% because they earn more. Now, the roommate's GF moves in, which might mean that the roommate's share is being occupied by two people. So maybe the fair thing would be to adjust the rent split so that each roommate's share is divided by the number of people in their room. But if the GF isn't contributing, that complicates things. \n\nBut the question is whether OP is in the wrong for asking for a rent reduction. The roommate is mad because OP is suggesting a 40-60 split (OP paying 40%). If the roommate's GF is moving in but isn't contributing rent, then the roommate's share might stay the same, but they have a guest. That might not be fair either. \n\nHowever, the initial arrangement had OP paying a higher percentage due to income. Now, if the GF moves in and the room is shared between the roommate and GF, maybe the split should be adjusted. But the roommate is not agreeing. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the GF is not contributing, the roommate is effectively getting more space for the same rent, which is unfair to OP. Therefore, OP's request for a lower share is reasonable. The roommate's implication that income alone should dictate the split without considering the change in occupancy might be the issue. \n\nSo, OP is not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
