      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (ITA) for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The roommate is implying that since the author makes more money, there shouldn't be any rent reduction. The author currently pays more than 50% because of the income difference and is suggesting a 40-60 split instead of 50-50. The roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the rent split. Typically, roommates split rent based on income or needs. The original split was more than 50-50 because the author earns more. When the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the housing situation changes\u2014there are now three people instead of two. However, the question is about whether the rent should be adjusted. \n\nThe author is arguing that since the roommate is now bringing in a third person, the rent should be adjusted so that the author pays less than 50%. The roommate, on the other hand, says there shouldn't be a reduction because the author makes more. The key points here are: the author's existing financial burden due to higher income and student debt, and the change in the number of occupants. \n\nIn split situations, it's common to adjust the rent if the number of people or their usage of the space changes. If the roommate's girlfriend is moving in and becomes a permanent resident, the total number of people sharing the space increases, which might mean the author should pay less. However, if the current split is based on income, the author might be justifying their higher share by contributing more towards rent. But when the roommate's partner joins, the original rationale (only two people) changes. \n\nThe roommate's implication that the author should continue paying more than half because of higher income might not consider the change in shared living arrangements. If the rent is now being split among three people, the author's percentage could decrease. The 40-60 split the author is suggesting is a way to adjust for the new person. \n\nThe roommate's anger might stem from feeling that the author is taking advantage or not recognizing their own higher income. But the author's request is about adjusting the split to reflect the new household composition, which could be seen as reasonable. \n\nStudent debt and the effort to get a higher-paying job are personal factors that the author might consider in their request. However, the fairness of the split is usually based on the number of people and their usage, not just income. If the rent is split equally regardless of income, then adding another person would mean each person's share is based on a three-person split, not two. \n\nSo, the author is in a position where they are adjusting their expectation based on the new number of occupants. The roommate's refusal to adjust the split could be unfair if the rent is now being shared by three people. Therefore, the author's request is not unreasonable. The roommate might be in the wrong for not considering the change in household size and expecting the same split.\n"
