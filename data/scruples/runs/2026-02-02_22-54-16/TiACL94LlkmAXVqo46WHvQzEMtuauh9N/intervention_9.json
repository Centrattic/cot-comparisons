I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The roommate is against a rent reduction because the author makes more money.\n\nFirst, the author is already paying more than 50% of the rent. That seems fair if their income is higher. Now, if the roommate's girlfriend moves in, that's three people sharing the apartment. Typically, splitting rent equally makes sense if everyone is using the space, but maybe the author expects to pay less since there are more people.\n\nThe author suggests paying 40% and the roommate plus his girlfriend paying 60%. That would mean the author still pays less than before, but the roommate is upset. The roommate's argument is that the author makes more money, but splitting 40-60 might be based on the new household size. The author is considering the student debt and the roommate's lack of it, which adds to the financial pressure.\n\nIs it fair to adjust the rent split when someone new joins? If the apartment is now shared by three people, it's common for the split to change. The roommate might feel that the author should still pay more because of higher income, but the author is arguing that with three roommates, the split should reflect that. The roommate's girlfriend moving in changes the dynamic, so the author's request isn't unreasonable. The roommate's resentment might be because he's used to the current arrangement and doesn't want to adjust. \n\nSince the author is trying to adjust the split fairly based on the new situation, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The roommate's opposition might stem from not wanting to reduce his own share, even if the math suggests a different split. So the answer is B.\n"
