I already pay more than 50-50 split because I make more money than he does. He has been implying that if his gf moves in then he doesn't think there should be any kind of rent reduction because I make more money. I'm annoyed, because:\n1. I already pay more than 50%\n\n2. I went to school for years to get something other than a minimum wage job (and now have student debt to pay off), while he didn't and has no debt.\n\nI don't think it's fair for gf to move in and for us to not split the rent where I pay less than 50%. I suggested I pay 40% and they pay 60%. Roommate is mad. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a rent reduction when their roommate's girlfriend moves in. The main points are:\n\n1. The roommate is bringing in a partner, which typically means the household size increases, so the rent might need adjusting.\n2. The author currently pays more than 50% because they earn more. The roommate argues against a rent reduction, citing the author's higher income.\n3. The author wants to adjust the split to 40-60, but the roommate is upset.\n\nFirst, fairness in rent splitting is usually based on income or needs. If the author is paying more now because they earn more, that's a common way to split costs. When the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the household's income and expenses might change. The author's argument is that the new split should reflect the increased number of people, so the rent should be divided among three people. But the author is suggesting a 40-60 split instead of a 33-33-33 or similar, which might not account for the new person's contribution. However, the roommate might not be considering that the author is willing to pay 40% instead of their current more than 50%, which is a reduction for the author. \n\nThe roommate's objection could stem from the fact that the author earns more, but if the rent is now split among three, the author's share should decrease. The author's reasoning is that since the roommate's income is lower and the household is growing, the rent split should adjust. The roommate might feel the author is taking advantage of the situation, but the author is trying to make the split fairer based on the new household structure. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to adjust for the new circumstances, even though the roommate is resistant. The key is whether the rent split is based on income or household size. Since the author is open to adjusting their share downward, which is fair, the roommate's anger might be unfounded. So the answer is B.\n"
