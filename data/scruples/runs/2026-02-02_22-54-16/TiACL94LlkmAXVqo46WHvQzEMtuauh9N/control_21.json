      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted on AITA is in the wrong. The situation is about a roommate whose girlfriend is moving in, and the poster wants a rent reduction. The roommate says there shouldn't be any reduction because the poster makes more money. The poster argues they already pay more than 50% and they have student debt, while the roommate doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the rent split. Typically, roommates split rent based on income or agreed upon terms. The poster is paying more already because they earn more, which is a common arrangement. When the roommate's girlfriend moves in, the poster suggests a 3-person split, which would make their share lower. The roommate is upset because the poster still makes more. \n\nThe key points here are: the existing split is based on income, the poster's financial situation (student debt vs. no debt), and the fairness when adding another person. The poster is adjusting their share because there are now three people, which is logical. The roommate's argument that the poster shouldn't get a reduction because they make more might not account for the increased number of roommates. \n\nIt's about whether splitting rent proportionally when the number of people changes is fair. The poster is trying to adjust the split to reflect the new living arrangement. The roommate's implication that the poster shouldn't get a reduction because of their higher income ignores the fact that the roommate's partner is now part of the household. \n\nSo, the poster's request seems reasonable. They're not asking for a reduction just because someone else is moving in, but because the number of people has increased by one. The original split was based on two people, now three. Adjusting the split to 40-60 makes sense if the roommate and his girlfriend are considered a single unit. The poster is paying less than they were before, which is fair given the new setup. The roommate's anger might stem from not wanting to adjust the split, perhaps expecting the poster to still pay the same amount despite the addition. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the poster is trying to maintain a proportional split based on income and the new number of people. The roommate's resistance could be seen as not considering the new dynamics. Therefore, the poster isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
