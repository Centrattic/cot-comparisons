      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong when they want a rent reduction because their roommate's girlfriend is moving in. The situation is that the roommate makes less money and currently they split the rent unequally based on income. Now, the roommate wants the girlfriend to move in but doesn't want to reduce the rent because the author makes more. The author is upset because they already pay more than 50% and don't want to pay even more than half. They suggested a 40-60 split, which the roommate is upset about.\n\nHmm. So, the main points here are about fairness based on income and the change in household structure. The author argues that since they pay more now because they earn more, when the roommate's partner moves in, the rent should be split differently. The roommate is resisting because the author makes more, even though the new partner is part of the household. \n\nI need to think about typical roommate agreements. Usually, when someone moves in, the cost is split based on income or equally. If the roommate's partner is moving in, that changes the household from two people to three (assuming the partner is now a roommate). But the current split was based on individual incomes. The author's argument is that since they already pay more due to higher income, adding another person (the partner) should adjust the split again. But the roommate might feel that the existing split is based on income and the new partner's presence doesn't affect that. \n\nBut wait, when the partner moves in, maybe the total rent is now split between three people? Or does the roommate and partner combine their incomes? The original arrangement was between two roommates. Now, if the partner moves in, the roommate might be sharing the new rent with their partner, but the author is suggesting that the author's share should decrease because two people are now sharing the other half. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that their higher income should mean they don't have to pay more than 50%, especially since they have student debt. The roommate is upset because they think the author should still pay more due to higher income. \n\nI think the key here is whether splitting rent based on income is a standard practice. In some cases, roommates split based on income, but when a new person moves in, the dynamics change. If the new partner is now a roommate, the three of them might need to negotiate a new split. The author is trying to adjust their share because the roommate's partner is moving in. However, the roommate is resisting because the author's higher income should justify a larger share regardless. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting a lower share? If the current split was agreed upon based on income, but now there are three people, the author might be right to want a different split. However, if the new partner is not a third roommate (maybe they're just visiting or staying temporarily), that's different. But the post says the girlfriend is moving in, so presumably, she's a new resident. \n\nIn most roommate situations, when someone moves in, the rent is divided based on the number of people or their combined income. If the original split was based on income, adding a new roommate might require recalculating based on the new income distribution. The author might be correct in wanting a 40-60 split if the new household has three people, but the roommate might not see it that way. \n\nThe author's argument about student debt and higher earnings is a personal factor. They might feel that their financial responsibility is higher, so they shouldn't have to pay more than 50%. The roommate might be upset because they feel their income is still lower, so the original split was fair. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's subjective. But if the original arrangement was based on individual income, and now the household structure changes, the author is not necessarily in the wrong to ask for a new split. The roommate being mad could be because they expected the original income-based split to stay, even with a new roommate. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to adjust the split based on the new household structure. The answer would be B.\n"
