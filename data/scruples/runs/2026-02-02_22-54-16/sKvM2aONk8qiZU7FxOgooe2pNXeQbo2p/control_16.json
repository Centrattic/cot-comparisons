      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. \n\nSo the situation is: the friend's birthday is coming up, and the author planned a surprise party at the friend's house. The friend mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to not be disappointed if there wasn't one. Now, the friend is clearly upset and said he would be mad if there's a party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a decision based on their interpretation of the friend's previous statements. The friend had explicitly said he hates parties, but the author dismissed that thinking the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment. Now, the party is planned and can't be canceled, and the friend is angry.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not listening to the friend's clear preferences. The friend's house is the venue, so this adds another layer of pressure because the friend has to host a party he doesn't want. \n\nFrom a friendship perspective, respecting someone's wishes is important. Even if the author thought they were being considerate by planning a party, ignoring the friend's repeated statements about disliking parties shows a lack of attention to his feelings. The surprise aspect might have been a good intention, but if the friend didn't want it, the surprise could be seen as violating his wishes. \n\nMoreover, the author waited until the last minute to check in, and when the friend clearly stated his opposition, the author still decided to proceed. That seems inconsiderate. The fact that the party is at his house makes it even worse because the friend has no choice but to host it, which could make him uncomfortable or angry. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's clear and repeated preferences. Even if the intention was good, the action disregarded the friend's feelings.\n"
