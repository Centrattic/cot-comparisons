      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for throwing a surprise party for their best friend, even though the friend didn't want it.\n\nFirst, the friend had mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times before. The author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But now, when directly asked, the friend clearly states he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so he's in a position to be really upset because he's there.\n\nThe author had been planning this for a while, and it's too late to cancel. They didn't listen to the friend's previous statements, maybe because they hoped the friend was just being modest or wanted to avoid hurt feelings. But surprise parties can be tricky because they rely on the recipient's preferences. If someone explicitly says they don't want it, even if indirectly, maybe it's a red flag. But the author might not have realized the friend was serious. However, the friend had said it multiple times, so the author should have taken that more seriously.\n\nThe key points are that the friend expressed dislike for parties before, the author ignored those warnings, and the friend is now clearly upset. Even though it's a surprise, the friend's feelings should have been respected. So maybe the author is at fault for not listening to the friend's clear preferences, even if they thought it was a good idea. The friend's discomfort or dislike is a valid reason not to do the party. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the friend's expressed wishes, leading to the friend's anger.\n"
