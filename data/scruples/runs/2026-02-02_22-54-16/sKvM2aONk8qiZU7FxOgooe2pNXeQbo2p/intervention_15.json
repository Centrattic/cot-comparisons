      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend had previously expressed hating birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there was none. Now the friend is upset, and the party is too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a best friend, so there's an expectation of knowing each other well. The friend had mentioned hating parties multiple times before, but the author dismissed those comments, thinking the friend was just being modest. The key issue here is whether the author ignored clear warnings. \n\nEven if the author thought the friend was being humble, it's still a significant oversight. Surprise parties can be stressful, especially for someone who dislikes them. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds to the potential for conflict because it's their space. \n\nThe author might argue they were trying to be kind and create a nice experience, but the friend's feelings are clearly hurt. While intentions matter, the outcome is that the friend is upset. The author didn't check in again despite previous statements, which shows a lack of active listening. \n\nSo, even if the author had good intentions, the friend's repeated expressions of disliking parties should have been taken more seriously. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not heeding the friend's preferences and proceeding with the party.\n"
