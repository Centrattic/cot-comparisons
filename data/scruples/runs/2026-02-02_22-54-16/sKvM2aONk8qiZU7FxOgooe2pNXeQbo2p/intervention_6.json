      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The situation is that the author planned a surprise party for their best friend's birthday, but when they asked the friend what he was doing, he said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The friend has previously mentioned hating birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the author is conflicted because they've been planning it for a while and it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points here. The friend has a history of expressing dislike for birthday parties. The author, perhaps out of good intentions, chose to ignore those past statements and proceeded with the party. The friend's recent comment was pretty clear, but the author might not have taken it seriously enough. The party is at the friend's house, so the friend being upset there could lead to a very uncomfortable situation for everyone involved.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social standpoint, respecting someone's preferences, especially when they've expressed them multiple times, is usually considered important. A surprise party is a big deal and can be stressful for the person being surprised. If the person repeatedly says they hate parties, then the friend's actions might be seen as disregarding their friend's feelings and preferences. The author's reasoning is that they thought the friend was just trying to manage expectations, but that line of thinking could be a mistake. It's possible the friend was genuinely not interested in a party, and the author should have respected that.\n\nHowever, the author might have thought they were doing something nice, not realizing the extent of the friend's discomfort. But since the friend's feelings were expressed clearly in the past and even more so recently, the author should have taken those into account. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds another layer of pressure because the friend can't avoid it. So, the author's actions could lead to a significant breach of trust and make the friend feel disrespected. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author did it out of love and friendship, and maybe the friend is being overly negative. But given the friend's clear previous statements, the author's responsibility is to honor those wishes. The answer would hinge on whether respecting the friend's expressed preferences outweighs the author's intentions. In social norms, respecting others' boundaries is generally prioritized over good intentions. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. So, the answer should be A.\n"
