      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend.\n\nThe situation is that the friend's birthday is coming up, and the author planned a surprise party at his house. The friend had mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there wasn't one. Now, the friend has clearly said he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The author is worried because it's too late to cancel and is asking if they're the asshole for going through with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's feelings. If he's explicitly stated he doesn't want a party, even if he's done so before, the author should have taken that into account. The friend might have a genuine dislike for parties, which the author might have dismissed as just a way to manage expectations. However, the author might have thought they were doing something nice, trying to make the friend happy. But respecting someone's wishes, even if they seem contradictory, is important. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The friend has a history of disliking birthday parties.\n2. The author ignored these clear statements and proceeded with planning.\n3. The friend now explicitly says he doesn't want it and would be mad.\n4. The party is at his house, which adds to the conflict.\n\nEven if the author thought the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment, the friend's current statement is clear. The author should have communicated to ensure they weren't overstepping. Planning a surprise party without confirming the friend's current feelings, especially after previous mentions, could be seen as not respecting his preferences. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they went ahead despite the friend's clear preferences. However, some might argue it was a well-meaning mistake. But given that the friend is now upset and it's too late to cancel, the author's actions are causing harm. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
