      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that the friend didn't want.\n\nFirst, the situation: The narrator planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend. The friend said he hates birthday parties and would be mad if there was a party. The narrator thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the party is at the friend's house, and it's too late to cancel. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The friend has expressed multiple times that he doesn't like birthday parties. The narrator ignored those statements and went ahead with the plan, assuming the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment. The key points here are the friend's clear preferences and the narrator's decision to proceed despite those preferences.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if someone has repeatedly stated their dislike for something, even if the planner thinks they might be mistaken, the planner should respect those wishes. Surprise parties are supposed to be a nice gesture, but if the person doesn't want any party, it's a problem. The narrator might have misread the friend's statements, thinking they were just hypothetical, but the friend was clear about his feelings. The consequence is that the friend is now upset, and the narrator is causing intentional harm or discomfort by proceeding.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the narrator is in the wrong because they didn't take their friend's expressed preferences seriously. Even if they thought they were doing something nice, ignoring someone's direct communication about their dislikes is a mistake. The correct choice is A.\n"
