      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend, even though the friend expressed not wanting a party. The friend said he hates birthday parties and would be mad if there was one. The author planned it for a while and thinks it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, the friend has mentioned before that he doesn't like parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to not be disappointed. But the friend specifically said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. So the author didn't listen to his friend's clear wishes. Even though the friend's house is where the party is, the author went ahead anyway. That sounds like they ignored their friend's feelings. Planning for a long time and not wanting to cancel might be their own feelings, but the friend's happiness is more important. The author should have respected their friend's preference. So the answer is A, they are in the wrong.\n"
