      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The friend explicitly said he hates birthday parties, and the author thought the friend was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there was no party. Now, the friend is upset because he didn't want a party at all, especially since it's at his house. The author is planning it for a long time and it's too late to cancel. \n\nHmm. The first thing that comes to mind is that the friend had clearly expressed his dislike for parties multiple times. The author might have disregarded those preferences, thinking the friend was just being modest. But the friend actually meant it, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if someone clearly states their preferences, even if others think they're just being polite, the person planning should take that seriously. The surprise party was based on a misunderstanding or ignoring the friend's explicit wishes. \n\nBut wait, the author thought the friend was just saying he doesn't like parties to avoid disappointment. That might show a lack of attention to the friend's actual feelings. The friend isn't just making a hypothetical statement; he's expressing a real aversion. \n\nThe fact that the party is at his house adds to the problem. The friend has to deal with the surprise there, which he didn't want. The author didn't ask directly if the friend wanted a party, maybe assuming based on past interactions. But if the friend said \"no\" or \"hate parties\" multiple times, that's a clear sign. \n\nSo, the author didn't listen to the friend's explicit requests and went ahead with the party. Even if the author thought the friend was being polite, the friend clearly meant it. The author should have respected that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
