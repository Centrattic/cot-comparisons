      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about throwing a surprise birthday party for a best friend, but the friend didn't want a party and is now upset. The friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the party is planned, and the friend is mad because he didn't want a party.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are communication and prior knowledge. The friend had expressed multiple times that he dislikes birthday parties. The author, however, ignored those statements, thinking the friend was just trying not to be disappointed. But the friend made it clear in their latest conversation that he specifically didn't want a party and would be angry if there was one. The party is at his house, so the situation is more personal and invasive.\n\nThe author's mistake was not taking the friend's previous statements seriously. Even if the friend had other reasons before, the latest conversation was a clear warning. The fact that the author continued planning despite knowing the friend's explicit refusal shows a lack of respect for the friend's wishes. The party is now in a position where it's too late to cancel, but the harm is done because the friend is upset. The author should have heeded the friend's feelings and not proceeded with the party. So, yes, the author is in the wrong. The correct answer is A.\n"
