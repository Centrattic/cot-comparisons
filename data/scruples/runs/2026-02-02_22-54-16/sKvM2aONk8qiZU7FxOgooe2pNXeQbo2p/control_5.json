      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend despite the friend not wanting one. The friend clearly stated he doesn't like birthday parties and was happy there wasn't one. The user had planned it for a long time and won't cancel now.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the friend's previous statements and the user's actions. The friend mentioned hating parties multiple times, but the user thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. The user decided to go ahead anyway, even though the friend is now upset and the party is at his house.\n\nSo, the user didn't take their friend's clear wishes into account. Even if they thought the friend might want a party to avoid disappointment, the friend explicitly said he would be mad if there was one. The user knew about the dislike but proceeded. That seems like they ignored their friend's feelings and preferences. Even though the party is already planned, the right thing would be to cancel if it's causing harm. So the user is in the wrong for not listening to their friend's explicit request and causing him distress.\n"
