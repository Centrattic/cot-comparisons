      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend's birthday is coming up, and the author planned a surprise party at his house. The friend had previously mentioned hating birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there wasn't one. Now, when the friend was asked directly about the party, he expressed being glad there isn't one and would be mad if there was. The party is already planned, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the friend's prior statements about disliking parties and the author's assumption that the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment. The author might have ignored clear signs that the friend wanted to avoid such events. Even if the friend's past comments were ambiguous, the direct conversation today where he explicitly stated he would be mad is a strong indication of his current feelings.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they thought the friend was just trying to manage expectations. But if the friend has said multiple times he hates parties, maybe the author should have taken that more seriously. Also, the party is at his house, which makes the situation worse because it's intrusive. The fact that the author is proceeding despite the friend's clear opposition now shows a lack of respect for his feelings.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't listen to the friend's explicit current wishes and ignored his past preferences. Even if planning is done, respecting someone's boundaries is important. The answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
