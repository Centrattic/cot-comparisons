      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend despite the friend previously expressing dislike for parties.\n\nFirst, the friend said they hate birthday parties multiple times. But the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there was no party. That's a common misunderstanding, but the friend clearly stated they would be mad if there was a party. The party is at the friend's house, which makes the situation worse because it's on their turf.\n\nNow, the author has been planning it for a long time and it's too late to cancel. But they didn't listen to the friend's explicit wishes. Even if they thought the friend was just being humble or trying to be polite, the friend made it clear they don't want parties. The surprise aspect also complicates things because the friend can't opt out if they don't know. \n\nIn relationships, respecting someone's boundaries is key. The friend's repeated statements about hating parties should have been a red flag. The author might have thought they were doing a kind gesture, but going against a friend's explicit wishes, especially for something as personal as a birthday, could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions were good, not heeding the friend's clear preferences and proceeding with plans the friend would find upsetting makes them at fault. The answer is A.\n"
