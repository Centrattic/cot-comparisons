      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. The friend had mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the person didn't take it seriously, thinking he just said that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there wasn't one. Now, the friend is upset and the party is at his house, so he's even more mad.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The friend clearly stated his dislike for parties multiple times. The author, however, chose to ignore those statements and proceed with the party. The key points here are the friend's prior expressions of disliking parties and the author's decision to go ahead despite that. \n\nEven though the author might have thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, the friend made it clear. The author should have respected those preferences. Planning a party for a long time doesn't negate the friend's feelings. Also, the party being at his house adds to the problem because it's his space and he's not comfortable with the event there. \n\nIn relationships, respecting others' boundaries and expressed preferences is crucial. The author didn't consider the friend's clear wishes, which is a breach of trust and respect. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. They didn't listen to their friend's explicit statements and proceeded without consent, which is a mistake.\n"
