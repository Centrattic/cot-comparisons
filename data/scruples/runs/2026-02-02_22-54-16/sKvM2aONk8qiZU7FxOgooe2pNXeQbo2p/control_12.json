      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their friend not wanting one. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend. The friend had previously mentioned hating birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. Now, the friend clearly stated he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one, but it's too late to cancel because the party is at his house.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the friend's past statements and the author's assumption. The friend had expressed dislike for parties multiple times. The author, however, thought those were just hypothetical statements, not genuine preferences. They went ahead with planning, ignoring the friend's expressed wishes, even though the friend now is adamant.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's feelings are important here. Even if the author thought the friend was joking or being sarcastic before, the friend is now clear. The author should have taken the previous statements seriously. Planning a surprise party against someone's expressed wishes, especially when they're clear now, seems like a breach of trust and respect. The author's actions are causing the friend to be upset, which they wanted to avoid. Also, the party is at the friend's house, which makes it even more personal and intrusive. So, the author didn't listen to their friend's boundaries, leading to a situation where the friend is angry. That points to the author being in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
