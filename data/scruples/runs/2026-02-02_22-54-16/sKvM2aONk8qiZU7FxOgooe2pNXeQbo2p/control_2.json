      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing a surprise party for a best friend despite the friend having expressed dislike for parties before.\n\nFirst, the author planned a surprise party, thinking their friend was just saying he hated parties to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one. The friend now says he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. The party is at his house, so cancelling might be too late.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are: the friend had mentioned hating parties multiple times, the author thought he was just trying to avoid disappointment, and the party is already planned. \n\nThe friend's clear statements about hating parties should have been taken seriously. Even if the friend was trying to be humble or didn't want to hurt the author's feelings, the author should have considered those feelings. Planning a party at the friend's house without confirming his current feelings is a risk. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting his friend's preferences, even if they misunderstood the friend's previous comments.\n\nBut maybe the friend was just being modest. However, multiple mentions of hating parties are a strong indicator. The author should have double-checked or maybe asked more directly. Since the party is at the friend's house, it's a personal space, so doing this without explicit consent is a big deal. \n\nSo the author probably is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
