      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who threw the surprise party is at fault. The scenario is that the best friend said he hates birthday parties and wouldn't be happy if there was one. The author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now they're stuck with a party at the friend's house, and the friend is upset.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and assumption. The friend had expressed his dislike for parties multiple times. The author might have ignored those clear statements, thinking they were just a way to avoid being disappointed. But if someone says something repeatedly, it's their preference, not just a hypothetical. So the author went ahead with the party despite knowing the friend's feelings. That seems like a misunderstanding. The author didn't take the friend's feelings seriously, assuming the friend was just being hypothetical. The friend's reaction is justified because he was clear. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
