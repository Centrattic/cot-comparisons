      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their best friend's previous statements about hating birthdays and expressing dislike for parties. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author planned a surprise party at the friend's house. The friend had mentioned multiple times he hates birthday parties, so maybe the author should have taken that into account. But the friend said he was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there wasn't a party. The author might have thought the friend was just being humble or didn't want to hurt feelings. However, the friend now says he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. \n\nThe author didn't realize that the friend really meant it, and now the party is a surprise, so it's too late to cancel. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong, but they want a second opinion.\n\nHmm. The main issue is whether the author should have listened more carefully to the friend's previous statements. Even if the friend said he'd be okay without a party, he might have been honest in his dislike. The author might have ignored clear red flags. Surprise parties can be stressful, and not everyone likes them. The friend might feel disrespected if the author didn't take his preferences seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought they were doing something nice, not realizing the friend's true feelings. Maybe the friend gave mixed signals. But if the friend clearly stated multiple times he hates parties, that's a strong indicator. The author's mistake was not respecting the friend's wishes, even if the friend downplayed it. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't honor the friend's stated preferences, leading to a situation where the friend is upset.\n"
