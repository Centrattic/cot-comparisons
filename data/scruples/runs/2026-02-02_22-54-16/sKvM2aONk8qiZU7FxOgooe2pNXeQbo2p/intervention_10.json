      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend had previously mentioned hating birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there wasn't one. Now, after confirming with the friend, who clearly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one, the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author planned the party for a long time, but the friend explicitly said he doesn't want a party. The author might have misunderstood the friend's earlier statements. The friend is now upset, and the party is at his house, which complicates things because he's the one whose space is being used for the surprise.\n\nThe friend had clearly communicated his dislike for parties before, but the author didn't take it seriously enough, thinking maybe he was just trying to avoid disappointment. Now, with the party already planned and too late to cancel, the author is caught in a situation where the friend is likely to be angry.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have respected the friend's previous statements about not wanting parties. Even if the friend's reasons were unclear, the author should have had a conversation to confirm preferences. The fact that the friend explicitly stated his position now shows that the author didn't take the necessary steps to ensure the party was wanted. \n\nThe author might argue that they thought they were doing something nice, but the friend's clear rejection now makes the author at fault for not heeding prior warnings. The harm done is the friend's discomfort and anger, so the author is in the wrong here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
