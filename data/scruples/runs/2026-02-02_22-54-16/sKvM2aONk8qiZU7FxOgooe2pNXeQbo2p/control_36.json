      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. \n\nFirst, the friend had mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times before. The author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. But now the friend is clearly upset that there is a party planned at his house. The author has already spent a lot of time planning, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication and assumptions. The friend had clearly expressed his dislike for parties before, but the author didn't take it seriously enough. Even though the author had good intentions and put effort into planning, the friend's preferences were ignored. \n\nSurprise parties can be tricky, especially when the person being surprised has stated their preferences. The author assumed the friend was just being modest or trying to avoid disappointment, which is a common assumption, but maybe not the right one here. The friend is now upset, and the party is at his house, which adds to his frustration. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the friend had explicitly said he hates parties, and the author didn't respect that, even after the friend clarified his feelings, it seems like the author made a mistake. Planning a party despite knowing it was unwanted is inconsiderate. Even if it's a surprise, the friend's wishes should have been respected. \n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't listen to the friend's clear preferences and proceeded with a party he didn't want.\n"
