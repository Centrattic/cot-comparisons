      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The scenario is that their best friend's birthday is coming up, and the author planned a surprise party at his house. But when they talked, the friend said he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The friend mentioned before hating parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that. Now the author is conflicted because planning is too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the friend's prior statements about disliking parties and the recent confirmation that he doesn't want a party. The author didn't listen and went ahead, which seems inconsiderate. Surprises can be tricky when someone has clearly expressed their preferences. Even though the author might have thought the friend was just saying not to be disappointed, the friend directly stated he would be angry if there's a party. The party is at his house, so the friend's discomfort is heightened.\n\nThe author's responsibility is to respect the friend's wishes, especially when they were given explicitly. Planning a party despite that shows a lack of consideration. The fact that it's too late to cancel isn't an excuse for proceeding without consent. The friend has the right to his space and personal preferences, and the author overstepped by not honoring that. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
