      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend's birthday is coming up, and the author planned a surprise party at the friend's house. The friend has mentioned before hating birthday parties, but the author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, when they talked, the friend explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The author feels they've invested a lot of time and it's too late to cancel.\n\nSo, the key points here: The friend has a history of disliking parties. The author didn't heed these warnings. The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the potential conflict. The author is now stuck with the party and feels they shouldn't cancel despite the friend's clear statement.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend has expressed his dislike multiple times. The author claimed to have thought the friend was just saying that. But then, when directly asked, the friend made it clear he doesn't want a party. The author didn't listen and is going through with it. Even though they've planned for a long time, the friend's feelings are important. The party is at the friend's house, so it's not just about the author's effort but also about respecting the friend's space and wishes. \n\nSurprise parties can be stressful, especially if the person doesn't want them. The author might have thought they were doing something nice, but if the friend is clearly against it, that's a problem. The author should have considered the friend's feelings more carefully. Even if the friend said he didn't mind before, the latest conversation shows he definitely doesn't want it. Ignoring that is a mistake. So, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the friend's explicit wishes. The answer should be A.\n"
