      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend when the friend didn't want one. The friend had mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset and the party is at his house, so he'll be extra mad.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respecting someone's preferences versus the surprise element. The friend had clearly stated multiple times that he doesn't like birthday parties. The author should have taken those statements seriously instead of dismissing them as a way to not be disappointed. Even though they considered it a surprise, the friend's expressed dislike should have been a red flag. Planning a party despite knowing the friend's position seems like a breach of trust and respect. The author prioritized their own plans without considering the friend's feelings, which is a mistake. So yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
