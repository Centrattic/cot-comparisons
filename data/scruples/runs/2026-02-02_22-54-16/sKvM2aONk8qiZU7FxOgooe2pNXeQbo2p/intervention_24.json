      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise birthday party. The friend had previously mentioned hating birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to not be disappointed. Now the friend is upset because the party is at his house, and the author is conflicted about canceling it at this point.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's feelings. The friend clearly stated he doesn't want a party, and multiple times before he said he hates them. The author might have dismissed those statements as just a way to manage expectations. But the friend now is explicitly mad, so the author should have taken those previous statements more seriously.\n\nEven though the author intended a surprise, which is meant to be a gesture of goodwill, the friend's preferences were clear. The fact that the party is at his house adds stress because it's his space. The author might have overestimated the friend's willingness to accept the surprise despite his past statements.\n\nOn the other hand, the author put in a lot of effort and time planning, and it's too late to cancel. But the friend's discomfort and anger are valid. The author didn't respect the friend's boundaries, leading to a conflict. So, while the intention was good, the execution overlooked the friend's clear wishes. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't listen to the friend's expressed preferences, even if they were trying to be nice.\n"
