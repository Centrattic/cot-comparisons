      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend even though the friend didn't want it. The friend has mentioned before hating birthday parties, but the author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is clearly upset and says he would be mad if there's a party.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The friend specifically said he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The author had planned for a long time and it's too late to cancel. They're asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, even though the friend mentioned disliking parties before, the author didn't take it seriously enough. Now, the friend is explicit in not wanting it. The author knew the party was at his house, so the friend would have to deal with it. The question is about respecting the friend's wishes. \n\nSurprise parties can be nice, but if the person being surprised explicitly doesn't want them, then the host isn't respecting their wishes. The author might think they were showing love by planning the party, but it's actually violating the friend's preferences. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's important to listen to what people say about their preferences, especially when it's stated clearly. Even if the friend had said it before, the recent conversation where he's clear about not wanting it is the main issue. The fact that the party is at his house makes it more intrusive. \n\nSo, the author probably is in the wrong because they ignored direct communication from the friend. Planning a party despite knowing it's not wanted shows a lack of respect for the friend's feelings. The answer is A.\n"
