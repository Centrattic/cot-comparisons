      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party when their best friend explicitly said he didn't want a party. \n\nFirst, the friend had mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one. Now, the friend clarified he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. The party is at his house, so he might be even more upset.\n\nThe key points here are that the author didn't listen to the friend's clear statements. Even though the friend made his feelings known multiple times, the author proceeded with planning. The friend's dislike of parties was a red flag that the author ignored. \n\nSurprise parties are supposed to be a surprise, but if the person being surprised has clearly expressed they don't want that, it's a problem. The author's reasoning was that the friend didn't want to be disappointed if there wasn't a party, but that's not an excuse to go against his direct wishes now. \n\nAlso, the party is at the friend's house, which makes the situation more personal and potentially more intrusive. The friend could be uncomfortable or embarrassed if the party happens, even if others are excited. \n\nSince the author didn't respect the friend's wishes and proceeded despite clear communication, they are likely in the wrong. The fact that it's a surprise might not matter if the person explicitly stated they don't want it. So the answer should be A.\n"
