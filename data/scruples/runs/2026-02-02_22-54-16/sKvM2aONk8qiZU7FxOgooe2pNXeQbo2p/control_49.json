      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their friend's previous dislike for birthday parties.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has a birthday coming up, and the author planned a surprise party at his house. The friend mentioned he hates birthday parties multiple times before, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one. Now, after talking today, the friend is clearly against a party and would be upset if there is one. The party is already planned, and it's too late to cancel. So the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the friend's past statements and the author's actions. The friend has explicitly said he dislikes birthday parties. Even if he was trying to be polite before, the author should have respected his wishes. Planning a party without considering his clear preferences shows a lack of respect for his feelings. The fact that the author thought he was just trying to avoid disappointment is a bit of a stretch. If someone keeps expressing they don't want something, it's better to listen than assume they're being humble or whatever.\n\nAlso, the party is at the friend's house, so the author is essentially making him uncomfortable in his own space. The author might not be in the wrong if they had checked in more recently or if the friend had only said it once, but multiple times? That's a red flag. The author should have taken the hint and not go through with it. Even if the party was planned a long time ago, respecting a friend's feelings takes precedence over the effort put into planning. So yes, the author is in the wrong for not listening and proceeding despite clear indications.\n"
