      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The situation is that the author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend, but when they asked the friend what he was doing for his birthday, the friend mentioned he's glad there's no party and would be angry if there was one. The friend has a history of saying he hates parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the author is wondering if they're in the wrong for not listening and proceeding with the party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's intention was to do something nice for their friend, which is a common motivation. However, the friend explicitly stated his dislike for parties, even if it's at his own house. The author might have misunderstood or dismissed the friend's previous statements, thinking they were just polite or to avoid being disappointed. But when the friend clearly expressed his feelings in their recent conversation, the author didn't take that into account.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author was aware enough of the friend's preferences. The friend had mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times before, so maybe the author should have taken that more seriously. Planning a party despite knowing the friend's past aversion could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the author thought the friend was being polite, the recent explicit statement about being glad there's no party and anger if there was one should have been a red flag.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue they had good intentions and didn't want to disappoint the friend by not having a celebration. But the problem is that the friend has made his feelings clear, and the author still chose to proceed. The party is at the friend's house, which complicates things because it's his space and his comfort is crucial. The author might be in the wrong here because they ignored the friend's explicit wishes, even after previous indications of dislike.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong. They didn't adequately respect the friend's preferences despite clear signals. The fact that they had been planning it for a long time and it's too late to cancel doesn't absolve them of the consequences of not listening. Therefore, the correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
