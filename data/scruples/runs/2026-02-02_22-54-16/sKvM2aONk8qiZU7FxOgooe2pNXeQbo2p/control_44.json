      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who threw a surprise party is in the wrong. The situation is that the best friend didn't want a party and explicitly said he hates birthday parties. The author ignored that and went ahead with planning it.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and respect. The friend had mentioned multiple times before that he dislikes parties, which the author thought might just be him saying it to avoid disappointment. However, the friend clearly stated he would be mad if there was a party. The author went ahead anyway, not considering the friend's feelings.\n\nEven though a lot of effort was put into planning, the main issue is that the author didn't take the friend's preferences seriously. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds another layer, as the friend might now be uncomfortable in their own space. The author should have respected the friend's wishes, especially since he explicitly said he didn't want it. So, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
