      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person asked if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party their best friend didn't want. The friend mentioned before hating birthday parties but maybe the author thought it was just a way to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset and the party is already planned.\n\nFirst, the author did plan a surprise, which is a common gesture, but the friend had previously expressed dislike for parties. Even if the friend said it to avoid being disappointed if there was no party, the author should have taken that as a strong hint. The key point here is that the friend clearly stated in the current conversation that he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so it's a big deal.\n\nThe author's defense is that they thought the friend was just saying it to avoid disappointment. But if the friend actually hates parties and was clear about it, even if past statements were ambiguous, the recent direct communication should have been a red flag. The author didn't consider the friend's feelings here, leading to a situation where the friend is upset. Since the party is already planned and can't be canceled, the author is causing harm despite the friend's clear wishes. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for not listening to their friend's clear preferences.\n"
