      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party when their friend said he doesn't want a party. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend, but the friend expressed not wanting a party. The friend even said he hates birthday parties multiple times before. However, the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. Now, the friend is upset because the party is at his house, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The friend had previously stated he hates parties. 2) The author didn't take those statements seriously, thinking the friend would be okay if there was a party. 3) The author is now going through with the party despite the friend's current explicit objection.\n\nI need to consider the social norms and expectations around surprise parties. Surprise parties are meant to be a nice gesture, but they require consideration of the guest of honor's preferences. Even if the friend might have been conflicted, the author went ahead without respecting the explicit current objection. The friend's direct statement about being glad there's no party and getting mad if there is one shows clear disapproval now. The author ignored those clear signals.\n\nAlso, the fact that the party is at the friend's house adds to the pressure because it's in his own space, which might make the situation more uncomfortable or intrusive for him. The author's reasoning that the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment in the past doesn't hold up when the friend has now clearly expressed anger about the party.\n\nEven though the author might have had good intentions, respecting the friend's current wishes is more important. The author's actions disregarded the friend's feelings and preferences, leading to potential harm in their relationship. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
