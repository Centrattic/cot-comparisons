      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. The friend said he hates birthday parties and would be mad if there was one, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now they're having the party anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a surprise party at the friend's house. The friend mentioned he doesn't want a party, but the author didn't take that seriously. The friend has expressed hating parties multiple times before, but the author assumed he was just trying to manage expectations if there was no party. Now the author is going through with it, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author ignored clear indications from the friend about his preferences. Even if the friend said he didn't want a party, the author might have thought it was a way to be humble or not express disappointment. However, the friend explicitly said he would be mad if there was a party, so that seems pretty clear. \n\nSurprise parties can be a way to make someone feel special, but the friend's repeated statements about disliking parties should have been a red flag. The author might have been overconfident in their interpretation of the friend's previous comments. Even if the friend said he didn't mind before, the recent conversation where he explicitly states he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one is a strong indicator. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the author should have respected the friend's wishes once they were clearly communicated. The fact that they've already planned the party and it's too late to cancel doesn't excuse ignoring the friend's direct feedback. The author's assumption that the friend was just being humble might be the problem here. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about respecting others' boundaries. Since the friend clearly communicated his dislike for parties and the author chose to ignore that, it's likely the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
