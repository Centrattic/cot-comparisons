      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that the best friend didn't want. The author planned it for a long time, but the friend clearly said he doesn't like parties and would be mad if there was one. The question is whether the author is at fault for not listening.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention was good, to surprise their friend and celebrate. They might have thought the friend was just being modest or didn't want to disappoint. But the friend has a history of disliking parties. The author proceeded despite the friend's explicit statement. \n\nNow, considering the friend's perspective: if someone has repeatedly said they hate parties, and then they find out a party is being thrown against their wishes, they might feel disrespected or not listened to. Even if the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, the friend's feelings are clear.\n\nOn the other hand, the author put a lot of effort into planning. Maybe they thought they were being kind, trying to make the friend happy. But the key point is that the friend communicated their dislike, and the author ignored it. \n\nSo, the ethical question here is about respecting someone's expressed wishes versus good intentions. Generally, respecting a person's boundaries is important. If the friend has made it clear multiple times, the author should have taken that seriously. Even if the friend was being \"modest\" before, the recent clear statement that he would be mad if there was a party means the author should have adjusted. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the friend's explicit wishes despite prior knowledge of his dislike for parties.\n"
