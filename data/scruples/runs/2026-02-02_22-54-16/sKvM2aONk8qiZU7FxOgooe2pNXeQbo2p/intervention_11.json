      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend has a birthday, and the author planned a surprise party at his house. The friend has mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there was no party. Now, when they talked, the friend explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The author is now conflicted because they've been planning it for a while and it's too late to cancel. They're asking if they're in the wrong for not listening and going through with it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respecting the friend's stated preferences. The friend has clearly expressed his dislike for birthday parties multiple times. The author thought the friend was just making excuses, but the friend now explicitly states he would be angry. So even though it was a surprise, the author didn't check in properly. \n\nSurprise parties can be tricky because they rely on the person being surprised. However, if the person has consistently said they don't like parties, maybe the author should have taken that more seriously. Even if the friend might have said that to avoid expectations, the author should have confirmed more directly. \n\nThe problem is that the author ignored clear signals. The friend's statements were pretty explicit, especially the recent conversation where he said he would be mad. The author might be overstepping by not respecting the friend's wishes now. \n\nAlso, the party is at his house, so being there when the party happens is unavoidable. That adds to the friend's frustration. The author's reasoning is that they thought the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment, but the friend actually meant he doesn't want the party. \n\nIn social situations, it's important to respect people's boundaries. Even if the intention was good, the author didn't honor the friend's preference. So maybe they are in the wrong. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't listen to the friend's clear statements and proceeded regardless, causing potential harm to the friendship.\n"
