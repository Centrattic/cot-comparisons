      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The main points are that the friend has previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. Now, the friend is upset because he didn't want a party at all, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the expectations. The friend has repeatedly stated he dislikes parties. The author, however, thought the friend was just being humble or maybe not wanting to let the author down if there wasn't a party. That's a common misinterpretation, right? People sometimes say they don't want a big deal made about their birthday but actually might appreciate a surprise. But in this case, the friend specifically said he hates parties, not just not wanting to make a big deal. \n\nThe author planned the party for a long time, and now it's too late to cancel. The friend is upset because the party is at his house and he's mad. So the key issue is whether the author should have taken the friend's previous statements more seriously. Even if the author thought the friend was just being polite, the friend clearly said he didn't want a party. The author might have thought it was a surprise and the friend would like it, but the friend clearly expressed the opposite.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have listened to the friend's direct statement. The fact that the friend said he would be mad if there was a party means the author ignored a clear indication. Even if planning was time-consuming, respecting the friend's wishes is more important. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't heed the friend's explicit request and caused the friend distress. The answer should be A.\n"
