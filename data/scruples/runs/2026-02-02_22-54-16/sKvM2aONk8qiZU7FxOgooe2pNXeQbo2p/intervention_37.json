      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend had mentioned hating birthday parties before, but the author thought maybe they were just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset and the party can't be canceled.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the author planned a surprise party despite the friend's past statements. The friend now says they don't want it and would be mad. The author might not have taken those past statements seriously enough. \n\nFirst, the friend had repeatedly said they hate parties. Even if they thought the friend was just preempting disappointment, ignoring clear preferences could be a mistake. Surprises can be nice, but if the person explicitly doesn't want it, even if it's in the past, the planner should consider that. \n\nThe author might have thought they were being thoughtful by planning a party, but maybe they should have double-checked more recently instead of just assuming. Since the party is at the friend's house, the friend's discomfort is even more direct. \n\nAlso, the author is now questioning if they're in the wrong. The friend's reaction is valid because their wishes weren't respected. Even if the party was well-intentioned, disregarding someone's known preferences can lead to hurt feelings. So maybe the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
