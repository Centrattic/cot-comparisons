      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The situation is that the friend had mentioned hating birthday parties before, but the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend is upset and the author is wondering if they should have listened more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend had expressed disliking parties multiple times, but the author might have dismissed those comments as a way to avoid being disappointed. The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the friend's frustration. The author has already planned it for a long time and it's too late to cancel now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. On one hand, the friend had given clear signals (multiple times) about not wanting parties. The author, however, didn't take those seriously enough, thinking the friend was just being polite or trying to manage expectations. On the other hand, the author's intention was to make the friend happy by throwing a surprise party, which is a common gesture. The friend's reaction is unexpected, but the author might not have realized the depth of the friend's feelings about parties.\n\nNow, considering the perspective of the friend: if they hate parties, having a surprise party at their home could be extremely stressful or uncomfortable. The author didn't ask directly if a party was okay, maybe assuming that because they're friends, the friend would appreciate it. But the friend's past statements should have been a red flag.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's preferences, even if they thought it was a good idea. The friend's repeated statements about disliking parties should have been a clear indication to avoid such a plan. The fact that the author is now facing a backlash might indicate that they didn't consider the friend's feelings properly.\n\nHowever, maybe the author didn't realize how strongly the friend felt. But in that case, the friend had the opportunity to clarify earlier. Since the author is now in a situation where it's too late to cancel, they might have to deal with the consequences, but that doesn't necessarily absolve them of responsibility for not listening.\n\nSo, weighing it all, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they ignored clear indications from the friend about not wanting a party, leading to the friend's upset. Even if the intention was good, not respecting the friend's wishes is a mistake.\n"
