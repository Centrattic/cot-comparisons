      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they threw a surprise birthday party for their best friend. The friend didn't want a party, and the person didn't listen because they thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is really mad, and they're asking if they're the a**hole for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's feelings. The friend has mentioned multiple times that they hate birthday parties. That seems like a clear indicator they don't want any. The person in question might have thought the friend was just making a joke or trying to be polite. But if someone repeatedly states their dislike, maybe the friend isn't just saying that to avoid disappointment. \n\nThen there's the aspect of planning the party. It's already planned, and they say it's too late to cancel. But the party is at the friend's house, which complicates things. Throwing a party there without the host's consent is a big deal. The friend is going to be angry because it's their space being used without their agreement.\n\nThe person might not have considered that the friend's dislike of parties is genuine. Even if they thought they were being considerate by planning something nice, they didn't actually check in properly. Maybe they should have asked more directly or confirmed if the friend was okay with the surprise. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one suggests that the person's assumption was wrong. They thought the friend was lying to avoid disappointment, but the friend is actually relieved there's no party. That's a miscommunication, but the person didn't adjust their plans despite the friend's clear statements.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person did plan without considering the friend's clear preferences. Even if they had good intentions, the result is that the friend is upset. The person might be in the wrong because they ignored the friend's repeated expressions of dislike for parties. \n\nBut then again, sometimes friends have different perspectives. Maybe the person thought the party was a good idea despite the friend's reservations. However, since the friend was explicit in their feelings, the person should have respected that. \n\nSo overall, the person probably is in the wrong because they didn't listen to their friend's clear wishes, leading to the friend's disappointment and anger. They should have either planned a different celebration or confirmed the friend's preferences more thoroughly before proceeding.\n"
