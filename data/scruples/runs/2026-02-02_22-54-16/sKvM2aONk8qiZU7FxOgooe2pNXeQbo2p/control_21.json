      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend specifically said he hates birthday parties and would be mad if there was one, but the author didn't take that into account.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and intent. The friend had mentioned multiple times that he dislikes parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. However, the friend clearly communicated his feelings in the latest conversation, stating he's glad there's no party and would be angry if there was one. The party is at his house, so the author is going ahead despite knowing this.\n\nThe author's actions seem to disregard the friend's expressed wishes. Even though they had planned it for a long time, the close proximity to the event (it's next week) makes it hard to cancel. But the issue is whether the author should have listened to their friend's explicit statement. If someone repeatedly says they don't want something, even if there's a history of them saying that before, the latest and most direct communication should be taken seriously. The author's justification is that they thought the friend was just saying that to not be disappointed, but the friend made it clear this time. So the author is ignoring the friend's current feelings, which is a breach of trust and respect. \n\nSurprise parties usually require keeping secrets, but if the person being surprised is against it, the surprise is problematic. The author's actions could lead to hurting the friend's feelings and damaging the friendship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's current wishes despite clear communication. The answer should be A.\n"
