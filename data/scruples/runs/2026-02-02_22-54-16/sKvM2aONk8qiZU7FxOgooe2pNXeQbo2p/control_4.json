      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party.\n\nThe scenario is that the narrator's best friend is having a birthday, and the narrator planned a surprise party at his house. The friend has mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the narrator thought he was just saying that to not be disappointed if there was a party. Now, the friend is upset because he didn't want a party at all. The narrator is planning to go through with it anyway because it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the narrator made a mistake. The friend has expressed dislike for parties multiple times, but the narrator didn't take it seriously. Even though the friend said he would be mad if there was a party, the narrator still decided to go ahead. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the narrator misinterpret the friend's previous statements? The friend said \"if there was one he would be mad af,\" which is pretty clear. The friend also mentioned not wanting a party before. The narrator's reasoning was that maybe the friend was just trying not to be disappointed if there was a party. But the friend actually wanted no party at all.\n\nSo, the narrator didn't listen to the friend's clear expressions and went against his wishes. Even though the party is already planned, the fact that the friend is upset and it's a surprise (so he can't leave) makes it problematic. The narrator should have respected the friend's feelings and preferences. \n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's wishes is important, especially when they've been clear. So, the narrator is in the wrong for not listening and proceeding despite knowing the friend's dislike for parties.\n"
