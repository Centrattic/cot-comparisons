      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that the best friend didn't want. The situation is that the friend had previously expressed dislike for birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to not be disappointed if there wasn't one. Now the friend is mad because the party is at his house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author made a mistake here. The friend had clearly stated in the past that he hates birthday parties. Even though he said he's glad there's no party, maybe the author should have taken that more seriously. The fact that the friend explicitly said he would be mad if there was a party at his house is a red flag. The author might have assumed the friend was being modest or wanted to be polite, but ignoring clear statements about preferences seems like a mistake. \n\nThen, there's the aspect of respecting someone's wishes, especially when they've been repeated. The author planned the party without checking in properly, even though the friend had mentioned it multiple times before. The surprise party is now at the friend's house, which makes it more personal and invasive. The friend's reaction is understandable because it's his space and his clear preferences were disregarded.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were trying to make the friend happy by planning a surprise. But the friend's previous statements should have been a signal that a party isn't wanted. Not respecting someone's boundaries, even with good intentions, can be seen as inconsiderate. The author didn't cancel despite knowing the friend's feelings, which shows a lack of respect for his wishes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they ignored the friend's clear preferences and proceeded with the party regardless. The answer should be A.\n"
