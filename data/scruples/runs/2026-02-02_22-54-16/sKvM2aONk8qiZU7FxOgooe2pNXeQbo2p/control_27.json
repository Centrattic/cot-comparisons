      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. The situation is that the friend explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one, and the party is at his house. The writer had been planning this for a long time and now can't cancel it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend has a history of saying he hates birthday parties. The writer thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But now the friend has clearly stated he doesn't want a party and would be upset. The party is at his house, so the friend is in a difficult position because he can't leave. \n\nThe writer's actions disregarded the friend's explicit wishes. Even if they thought the friend was just being humble or didn't want to hurt feelings before, the recent conversation directly states the opposite. The writer didn't take that feedback seriously and is proceeding with the party. \n\nSurprise parties are supposed to be a way to make someone feel special, but if the person doesn't want it, it's actually causing distress. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds to the problem because the friend can't escape the situation. The writer's insistence on going through with the party despite knowing it's unwanted shows a lack of respect for the friend's preferences. \n\nAlso, the writer mentions that it's too late to cancel. While that might be true logistically, the responsibility lies in planning ahead and being able to adjust if necessary. The writer could have considered alternative plans if they realized the friend's stance. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer is in the wrong because they ignored their friend's clear and recent communication about not wanting a party, leading to a situation where the friend is forced to be in an environment they find unpleasant. The answer should be A.\n"
