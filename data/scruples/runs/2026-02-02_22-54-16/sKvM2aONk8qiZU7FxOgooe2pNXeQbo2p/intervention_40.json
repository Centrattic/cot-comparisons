      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset and the party is already planned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend had expressed dislike for parties before, but the author didn't take it seriously. The party is at his house, which could make the situation worse if he's there. The author planned it for a long time and now it's too late to cancel.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is about respecting someone's wishes. Even if the author thought the friend was just being polite or trying not to hurt their feelings, the friend clearly stated his preference multiple times. The author might have a good intention, wanting to celebrate the birthday, but not considering the friend's feelings could be a mistake.\n\nWait, but sometimes people say they don't want a party but secretly appreciate the effort. However, in this case, the friend is explicitly saying he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. So the author didn't just ignore a one-time comment but multiple statements. Even if it's a surprise, the friend's preferences should be respected. The author might not be in the wrong if they thought the friend was just being humble, but given the clear statements, maybe they are. The answer depends on whether the friend's wishes were genuinely misunderstood or deliberately ignored. Since the friend said it multiple times, the author should have known better. So the answer is AITA? The author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their friend's clear preferences.\n"
