      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend despite the friend expressing dislike for parties. The key points here are the friend's previous statements and the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the friend has mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times. The author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, so they went ahead with planning a party. Now the friend is upset because he clearly didn't want it. The party is at his house, which adds to the frustration because the author won't be able to cancel it.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author should have taken the friend's previous statements more seriously. Even if the friend might have been trying to avoid letting the author down, the author still made a choice based on their own interpretation. The surprise aspect and the fact that it's at the friend's house makes it especially problematic because it's hard to reverse the decision now. \n\nThe author's intent was good, but they didn't consider the friend's clear preferences. The friend might feel betrayed or disrespected because the author didn't take his feelings into account. While the author had good intentions, the outcome is causing harm to the friend. So, even if the author thought they were being considerate, their actions went against the friend's expressed wishes. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they should have respected the friend's prior statements about hating parties instead of assuming the friend was just being modest.\n"
