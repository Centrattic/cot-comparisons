      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend. They mentioned that everyone was excited and things were going smoothly until today. Then they had a one-on-one conversation where the friend said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The friend also has a history of saying he hates birthday parties. The author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, so they proceeded with planning. Now, they're wondering if they're in the wrong for not listening and going ahead.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about consent and communication. Surprise parties rely on keeping the surprise, so the friend didn't get a chance to say no directly about the surprise. However, the friend had previously expressed disliking parties, which the author might have overlooked. The friend is now upset because the party is at his house, making the situation more personal. The author might have ignored clear signs (past statements) and then confirmed the friend's feelings today. Even if the friend's past comments were ambiguous, the recent direct statement seems clear. The author proceeded despite this, leading to potential hurt feelings. The friend's current reaction is anger because he didn't want the party, so the author may have acted without respecting his boundaries. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
