      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise birthday party for their best friend, even though the friend said he doesn't like parties and would be mad. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but maybe the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. However, the friend clearly stated again today that he's glad there's no party and would be angry if there was one. The party is at his house, so the friend can't really avoid it.\n\nThe author has been planning this for a long time and it's too late to cancel. They might feel they're doing something nice, but the friend's feelings are important here. Even if the friend's previous statements were ambiguous, the recent direct communication should have been taken more seriously. \n\nSurprise parties require keeping secrets, which can be tricky if the person being surprised has clear reservations. The author might have ignored key warnings, leading to the friend's anger. The friend's right to not have a party he doesn't want should weigh heavily here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was good, but maybe they should have respected the friend's expressed wishes more. The fact that the friend was explicit this time suggests the author should have listened. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because they disregarded the friend's clear communication and the friend's known preferences.\n"
