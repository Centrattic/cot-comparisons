      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that the friend didn't want. The friend didn't like parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author planned a surprise party despite the friend's previous statements about hating birthday parties. The friend now says he would be mad if there was a party, and the party is at his house. The author is wondering if they're wrong for not canceling.\n\nThe author mentions that the friend had said he hates birthday parties many times before, but the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid being disappointed. So there's a history here. The friend's clear communication now is that he's against the party, but the author is proceeding because it's too late to cancel.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The friend's previous statements should have been taken into account. Even if the author thought the friend was being modest, the friend's dislike of parties is a red flag. Surprise parties can be stressful, and if the friend specifically said he didn't want one, the author should have respected that. The fact that the party is at his house adds another layer because it might inconvenience the friend. \n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, ignoring the friend's clear preferences might be considered inconsiderate. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author should have listened. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
