      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person asked if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their friend's previous comments about hating birthday parties. The friend said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one, and the party is at his house.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the friend has expressed dislike for parties before, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. The author planned it for a long time and now it's too late to cancel. The key points here are the friend's past statements and the current refusal. \n\nSurprise parties require keeping the surprise secret, so the author couldn't have confirmed with the friend lately. The friend's direct statement now is that he doesn't want a party and would be angry. Even if the author thought the friend was just being modest before, the current explicit refusal is a red flag. \n\nThe party is at his house, which adds pressure because it's his space and he's indicating he doesn't want that. The author might have overestimated the friend's willingness to pretend to like parties. The friend's clear objection now means the author should respect that, even if they're excited about the party. \n\nSo, the author didn't listen to the friend's recent and explicit request. Even though they tried to do something nice, ignoring the friend's current feelings is problematic. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they disregarded the friend's current wishes, which were clear.\n"
