      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who planned a surprise party for their best friend is in the wrong after the friend expressed that they didn't want a party. The key points here are communication, prior knowledge, and the consequences of the action.\n\nFirst, the friend mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times before. The author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there was no party. However, the friend clearly stated they would be mad if there was a party, even though the party is at their house. The author had planned it for a while and it's too late to cancel now.\n\nNow, considering the friend's previous statements, the author should have taken them seriously. Even if they thought the friend might be trying to downplay expectations, the friend's recent explicit statement about being glad there's no party and getting angry if there is one is a clear warning. The author's decision to proceed despite this direct communication shows a lack of respect for the friend's wishes. \n\nSurprise parties can be a good gesture, but when the person being surprised has clearly and repeatedly expressed dislike for such events, it's a significant oversight. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds to the potential awkwardness and invasion of personal space. The author might not have intended to cause harm, but ignoring clear signals that the friend is uncomfortable is a mistake. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they disregarded the friend's direct and previous expressions of displeasure about birthday parties, leading to a situation where the friend will likely be upset. The author should have respected the friend's boundaries and not proceeded with the party.\n"
