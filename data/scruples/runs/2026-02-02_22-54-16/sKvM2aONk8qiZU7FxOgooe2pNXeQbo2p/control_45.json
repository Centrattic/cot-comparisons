      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for throwing a surprise party for their best friend even though the friend didn't want it. The friend had mentioned before hating birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is clearly upset and the party is already planned at his house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's previous statements. The friend said he hates birthday parties multiple times. That seems like a clear indication, even if the author thought he was just being modest. Ignoring those warnings might be a problem. Also, the party is at his house, so being there for the surprise might be awkward or uncomfortable for him. \n\nAnother angle is the effort the author put into planning. They've worked on it for a long time, and it's too late to cancel. But the friend is genuinely upset, which is a valid emotion. The author didn't listen to his direct statement this time when he said he'd be mad if there was a party. \n\nIs the author wrong for not canceling? Well, respecting someone's wishes is important in a friendship. Even if the intention was good, not heeding direct communication can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend might feel disrespected or like his preferences were ignored. However, the author might argue they didn't know how serious it was. But if the friend had multiple times said he hates parties, the author should have taken that into account. \n\nThe key points are the repeated statements from the friend and the direct communication today. The author might have misunderstood earlier, but after the friend explicitly said he'd be mad, proceeding with the party seems like a mistake. So, the answer is A.\n"
