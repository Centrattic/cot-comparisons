      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The situation is that the friend had previously expressed dislike for birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend is clearly upset and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author planned a surprise party at the friend's house, which the friend found out and is upset about. The friend mentioned multiple times before that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to not be disappointed. The party is already set, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about respecting someone's wishes versus the intentions of the planner. The author's intention was good\u2014they wanted to do something nice for their best friend. However, the friend had explicitly stated multiple times that he dislikes such events. The author might have ignored those clear signals, assuming they were just polite disclaimers. But the friend's current reaction shows that he was serious.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to do something thoughtful, maybe without realizing that the friend's preferences were non-negotiable. On the other hand, the friend had communicated his dislike for parties, so the author should have respected that. Even if the author thought the friend might be saying it to avoid disappointment, the friend's direct statement now confirms that he was against it.\n\nIn AITA situations, intentions matter, but actions and consequences also do. The author acted despite clear prior warnings. While the party was a surprise and meant well, the friend's feelings are valid. The author might be in the wrong for not heeding the friend's expressed preferences, even if they were trying to be considerate. However, some might argue that the author's good intentions mitigate the wrongness. But in most cases, ignoring someone's repeated preferences, even unknowingly, can be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they disregarded the friend's clear expressions of dislike for parties, leading to the friend's upset. The key is that the author should have trusted the friend's past statements as genuine, not just a way to avoid disappointment. Even if it was a surprise, the friend's current anger suggests the action was hurtful.\n"
