      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their best friend's previous comments about hating birthday parties. \n\nFirst, the friend mentioned hating parties but the author thought they were just saying that to avoid disappointment. The party is at the friend's house, which complicates things because the friend will have to deal with the event he didn't want.\n\nThe key points here are intent and communication. The author had good intentions, wanting to celebrate their friend's birthday. But they didn't take the friend's repeated statements seriously enough. Even if the friend said it to avoid expectations, the author should have considered those feelings. Planning a party at the friend's house without confirming again might show a lack of respect for their boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author is now stuck with the party being too late to cancel. However, the main issue is whether they were wrong in not heeding the friend's previous preferences. The friend's clear dislike should have been a red flag. The author might have acted out of enthusiasm but ignored the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, even though the author's intention was good, not respecting the friend's expressed wishes is a mistake. The answer is A.\n"
