      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The situation is that the author's best friend hates birthday parties, but the author proceeded to plan a surprise at his house anyway. The friend now says he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's previous statements. The writer mentions that the friend said he hates birthday parties multiple times. But the author thought maybe the friend was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there wasn't a party. So the author assumed that the friend might actually want a party but just said he didn't. But when they talked, the friend clarified he doesn't want a party and would be angry if there was one. \n\nNow, the author has already planned the party and it's too late to cancel. The question is, is the author in the wrong for not listening to the friend's wishes?\n\nThe key points here are communication and respecting boundaries. The friend did express his dislike for parties, but maybe the author didn't take it seriously. Even if the author thought the friend was being modest or trying to avoid disappointment, the friend was clear in their latest conversation. The party is at the friend's house, which makes the situation worse because the friend is in their own space. If the friend finds out, he's going to be upset, and the party might disrupt his birthday plans.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption the author made. Maybe the author should have clarified earlier or checked in more directly. The fact that the friend was explicit in their latest conversation suggests that the author should have respected that. Even if the party is already planned, proceeding without the friend's consent could be seen as disregarding their feelings. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is a red flag. The author might have misread the friend's previous statements, but the recent conversation provides clear evidence. Not backing down now, especially when it's too late to cancel, shows a lack of respect for the friend's wishes. \n\nIn terms of social norms, throwing a surprise party when the person doesn't want one is generally seen as inconsiderate. The fact that it's at the friend's house adds another layer because the friend is hosting their own event but doesn't want it. So the author is imposing their own idea of a celebration on someone who has expressed not wanting it. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. They ignored the friend's clear communication and proceeded with plans that the friend would not appreciate, especially in their own home. The author should have respected the friend's wishes from the start or at least tried to cancel when the friend made it clear.\n"
