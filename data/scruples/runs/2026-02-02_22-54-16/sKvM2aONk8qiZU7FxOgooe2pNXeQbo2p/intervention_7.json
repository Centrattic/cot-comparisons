      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend at the friend's house. The friend has mentioned multiple times before that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there wasn't one. Now, the friend explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one, but the party is already planned, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's past statements. He said he hates parties, but the author didn't take them seriously, thinking he might be being modest or not serious. But if the friend clearly expressed his dislike multiple times, the author should have paid attention. Planning a party at his house without confirming his current feelings could be seen as ignoring his preferences. Even if it's a surprise, the friend is the one who has to be there, so the author should have made sure it's what he wanted. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be thoughtful by planning a surprise, which is a common way to show you care. Maybe they thought the friend would appreciate it even though he said he didn't like parties. But the friend's recent clear statement seems to have changed things. The author's friends might be excited, but the main issue is the friend's feelings. \n\nThe key points are: past statements of disliking parties, the author's assumption that those were just to avoid disappointment, and the recent explicit refusal. The author didn't check in properly and is now causing the friend distress. So the author probably is in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's clear wishes despite prior indications. Even if the intention was good, the action disregards the friend's expressed preferences. So the answer should be A.\n"
