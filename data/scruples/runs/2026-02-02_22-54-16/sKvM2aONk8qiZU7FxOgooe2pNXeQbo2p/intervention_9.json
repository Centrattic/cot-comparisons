      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for throwing a surprise party when their friend explicitly said they don't like parties and would be mad if there was one. \n\nThe situation is that the friend had previously mentioned hating birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there was no party. Now, the friend clarified he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so he'll be there, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The friend's clear communication that he hates parties and would be upset. The author, despite this, went ahead with planning because it's too late to cancel. \n\nThe user's initial thought was that the author isn't wrong, but they're curious about others' opinions. \n\nI should consider if the author disregarded clear signals. The friend had mentioned hating parties multiple times, which the author might have dismissed. Even if they thought the friend was just saying it to avoid disappointment, the friend now explicitly states he would be mad. The party is at his house, so the author is hosting it there despite knowing this. \n\nThe author is in a position where they've invested time and effort, but they also ignored the friend's preferences. Friends should consider each other's boundaries. Maybe the author should have checked in again or chosen a different celebration style. \n\nHowever, the author might have thought they were being thoughtful by surprising the friend. But if the friend's preferences are clear, then it's a case of not respecting those boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they ignored explicit statements from the friend. The key is whether the author should have respected the friend's known dislike for parties despite their own efforts. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
