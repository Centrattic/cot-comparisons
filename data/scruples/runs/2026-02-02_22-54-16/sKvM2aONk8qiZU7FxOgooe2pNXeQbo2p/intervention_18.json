      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their friend's previous dislike for birthday parties. The friend had mentioned hating parties but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend is upset and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the friend's past statements about not liking parties and the author's decision to proceed regardless. The author believed their friend was being hypothetical, so they went ahead with planning. But the friend clearly expressed disappointment now, which is causing conflict.\n\nI need to consider whether the author should have respected the friend's previous wishes more seriously. Surprise parties can be tricky because they rely on the recipient being okay with it. If the friend explicitly said he doesn't want parties, even if it was for others, the author might have ignored that. However, the friend's past statements might have been more about not wanting to disappoint others if there's no party, not necessarily wanting to avoid a party they had no prior knowledge of. \n\nAlso, the party is at the friend's house, which adds another layer. Having a party there might make the friend feel even more caught off guard and uncomfortable. The author planned it for a long time, so maybe there was no way to back out, but the friend's current reaction is valid. \n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone clearly expresses a dislike for certain things, it's usually better to respect that. The author might have missed the seriousness of those past statements. So, even though the friend might have said it before in a different context, the author should have double-checked or considered that the friend truly didn't want a party. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't heed the friend's clear preferences, leading to the friend's current anger. The answer would be A.\n"
