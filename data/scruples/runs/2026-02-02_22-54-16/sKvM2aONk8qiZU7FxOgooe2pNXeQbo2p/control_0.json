      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question did something wrong by throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The situation is that the friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the person didn't take it seriously, thinking maybe he just didn't want to disappoint them. Now the friend is upset and the party is already planned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author knew or should have known the friend's preferences. The friend had mentioned hating parties multiple times before, so it's clear he doesn't like them. The author thought he was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there was no party. But maybe they should have taken his previous statements more seriously. Surprise parties aren't always appropriate if the person has expressed dislike for them. The fact that the party is at his house adds to the problem because he can't really opt out. The author went ahead despite the friend's clear preferences, which is a mistake. Even though they might have thought they were doing something nice, ignoring someone's expressed wishes is wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
