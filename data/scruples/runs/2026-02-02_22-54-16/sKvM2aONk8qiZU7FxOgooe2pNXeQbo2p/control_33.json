      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise party for their best friend, who apparently didn't want it. The situation is that the friend said he's glad there's no party and would be really mad if there was. The party is at his house, so it's a big issue.\n\nFirst, the user planned a party despite the friend's previous statements about hating birthday parties. Even though the friend might have been trying to avoid disappointment before, the user didn't take those statements seriously enough. The key point is that the friend clearly expressed not wanting a party, but the user went ahead anyway. \n\nThe friend's direct statement today was a clear indication that he didn't want a party, but the user ignored that. Planning took a long time, but that doesn't justify ignoring the friend's current wishes. The user's actions could be seen as disregarding the friend's feelings and boundaries. \n\nSo, even though the intention was good, the action of proceeding with the party despite clear opposition is where the mistake is. The user is in the wrong because they didn't listen to the friend's explicit wishes, leading to a conflict. Answer A.\n"
