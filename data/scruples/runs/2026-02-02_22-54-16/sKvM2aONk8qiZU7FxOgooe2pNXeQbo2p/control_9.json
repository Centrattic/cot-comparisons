      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they threw a surprise party for their best friend, but the friend didn't want a party and is now upset. The user mentions that the friend said he hates birthday parties and that if there was a party he would be mad. The user thought maybe the friend was just saying that to not be disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's previous statements. If he had expressed multiple times that he doesn't like birthday parties, that's a red flag. The user should have taken that into account instead of dismissing it as the friend not wanting to be disappointed. Planning a party at the friend's house on his birthday without considering his preferences seems like a big oversight. Even though the user had planned it for a long time, the friend's clear dislike of parties should have been a priority. The user didn't check in properly and now the friend is upset. So, the user didn't listen to their friend's wishes, which is a mistake. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
