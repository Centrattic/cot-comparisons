      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend, who has previously expressed hating birthday parties. Despite this, the author assumed the friend might have been saying that just to avoid disappointment if there was no party. Now, the friend is upset and the party is at his house, making the situation awkward and potentially hurtful.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's past statements about disliking parties and the author's decision to proceed despite knowing this. Even if the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, the friend's recent confirmation that he's glad there's no party (and would be mad if there was) shows a clear contradiction in the author's assumption.\n\nSurprise parties require knowing what someone truly wants. If the friend has consistently said he hates parties, the author should have taken that as a strong indicator. The fact that the party is at his house adds to the problem because it's an intrusiveness into his space, which he now clearly doesn't want.\n\nThe author's justification is that they've been planning for a long time and it's too late to cancel. However, respecting someone's boundaries, especially when they've been clearly stated, should outweigh the effort put into planning. The author's actions led to the friend's anger, which indicates that the author didn't truly listen or respect their friend's preferences.\n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions, the outcome is negative because they ignored clear signals from the friend. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they disregarded their friend's expressed wishes.\n"
