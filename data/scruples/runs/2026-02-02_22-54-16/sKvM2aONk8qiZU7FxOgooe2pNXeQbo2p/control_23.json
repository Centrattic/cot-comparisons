      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who threw an unwanted surprise party is in the wrong. The situation is that the person planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend, but the friend clearly expressed that he hates birthday parties and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so the friend is likely really upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about respecting someone's wishes. The friend had mentioned before that he dislikes birthday parties. Even if the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment, the friend explicitly stated his feelings again when asked. The author ignored this and proceeded with the party, which was at the friend's house. \n\nNow, considering the context, the author had prior knowledge of the friend's aversion to parties. Even if the author thought the friend was just being modest or wanted to avoid hurt feelings, the friend made it clear again. Not taking that into account shows a lack of respect for the friend's preferences. \n\nAlso, the party is at the friend's house, which adds another layer. Hosting a party there without the host's consent is a significant issue. The friend would not only be upset about the party but also about it being at their place. \n\nThe author might argue that planning is already done and it's too late to cancel, but that doesn't excuse going against the friend's clear wishes. The friend's feelings and comfort should take precedence. \n\nSo, the answer would be AITA A, meaning the author is in the wrong. They didn't listen to their friend's explicit preferences, leading to a situation where the friend is upset. Even if the intention was good, the outcome is a violation of the friend's expressed wishes.\n"
