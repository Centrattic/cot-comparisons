      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who threw a surprise party without considering their friend's explicit dislike for parties is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the friend had previously expressed hating birthday parties multiple times. The author thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But then, when directly asked, the friend clearly stated he didn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so it's a big deal.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author ignore clear signals? The friend had said \"no party\" multiple times. Even if others were excited, the author should have prioritized the friend's wishes. Planning a party despite the friend's explicit refusal shows a lack of respect for his preferences. The author's reasoning that maybe the friend was just saying it to avoid disappointment doesn't hold up when the friend confirmed today's statement. So, the author didn't listen and went ahead, which is wrong. The answer is A.\n"
