      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend explicitly said he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The author had plans for a long time, but now it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend has mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times before. The author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there was no party. But the friend actually meant he didn't want a party, so the surprise is going against his wishes.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and respecting boundaries. Even if the author thought they were being considerate by planning a party, the friend clearly communicated his preference against parties. The author didn't take that into account and proceeded anyway, leading to the friend's anger. \n\nIn relationships, especially with close friends, it's important to listen to their preferences. The author might have had good intentions, but ignoring the friend's stated wishes is a mistake. It's about respecting the friend's autonomy. Even if the party was planned for a long time, the friend's feelings and explicit statements should take precedence. \n\nSo, the answer here is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they disregarded their friend's clear wishes. The fact that the party is at the friend's house and he's going to be extra mad adds to the problem. The author should have made an effort to confirm the friend's preferences again before proceeding, especially since the friend had previously expressed dislike for parties. Assuming that the friend was just being humble or didn't want to disappoint the author was a mistake.\n"
