      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for throwing a surprise party that the best friend didn't want. The key points here are communication and prior knowledge.\n\nThe author mentions that their friend has said he hates birthday parties multiple times before. But they thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. The problem is the friend clearly expressed not wanting a party now, and the author still went ahead with it despite knowing the friend's feelings.\n\nEven though the party is planned and it's too late to cancel, the main issue is that the author didn't listen to their friend's current wishes. The friend explicitly stated he would be mad if there was a party, and the author ignored that. So, the author didn't respect their friend's current feelings, leading to a breach of trust. The prior planning doesn't excuse not honoring the friend's current request. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
