      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about throwing a surprise birthday party for a best friend. The author planned it for a while, but the friend expressed not wanting a party. The friend said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there wasn't one. Now, the party is at the friend's house, and the friend is upset.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author should have listened to the friend's previous statements about not wanting a party. The friend clearly stated he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The author didn't take those feelings into account and went ahead with the plan. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were doing something nice, not realizing how much the friend dislikes parties. On the other hand, the friend had mentioned this dislike multiple times, so the author should have been aware. Even if the friend said it to avoid disappointment, the author didn't consider that possibility. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds to the problem because it's more intrusive. \n\nThe key points are: the friend's repeated statements about hating parties, the author not taking those into account, and the party being at the friend's house. The author might have overlooked the friend's feelings, leading to the friend's anger. So, the author probably is in the wrong because they didn't respect the friend's expressed preferences, even if they meant well. The answer should be A.\n"
