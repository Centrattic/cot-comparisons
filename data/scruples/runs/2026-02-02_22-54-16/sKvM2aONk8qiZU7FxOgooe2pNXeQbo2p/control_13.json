      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend is in the wrong after the friend expressed not wanting a party. The question is whether the author made a mistake by ignoring the friend's wishes.\n\nFirst, the friend clearly stated he hates birthday parties and was glad there wasn't one. The author had previously thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, but now the friend is explicitly upset. The party is at his house, so the friend's anger is justified because he didn't want a party and the author went ahead anyway.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) the friend communicated his dislike for parties multiple times, 2) the author disregarded those statements, assuming they were just to avoid disappointment, and 3) the event is at the friend's home, making the situation more intrusive and stressful for him. \n\nEven though the author put in effort and planning, respecting the friend's expressed wishes should take precedence. The friend's feelings and comfort are important, and the author's assumption that the friend would be okay with a party despite his past statements is a mistake. The fact that the party can't be canceled now doesn't excuse going through with it against the friend's clear preferences. So, the author is in the wrong for not listening and pushing forward, which AITA cases typically judge based on respect for others' boundaries.\n"
