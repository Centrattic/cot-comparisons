      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if someone is in the wrong for throwing a surprise birthday party at their best friend's house when the friend didn't want a party. \n\nFirst, the friend clearly stated he doesn't want a party and even said he'd be mad if there was one. The author mentions that the friend has said he hates parties multiple times before, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now they're planning it, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the friend's clear preferences and the author's decision to ignore them. Even though the author thought the friend was just being polite, the friend explicitly said he doesn't want a party. The author didn't double-check or ask for clarification, which might be an issue. Also, the party is at the friend's house, so the friend's comfort is important. \n\nSurprise parties can be stressful, especially if the person doesn't want to be the center of attention. The author might be overstepping by not respecting the friend's wishes. Even if it's late to cancel, the friend's feelings should take precedence. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the friend's expressed preferences, leading to a potential conflict.\n"
