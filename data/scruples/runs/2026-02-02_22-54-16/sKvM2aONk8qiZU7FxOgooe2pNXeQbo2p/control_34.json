      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The situation is that the friend has previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend is upset that there's a party planned at his house.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author planned a surprise party without confirming the friend's current feelings. The friend explicitly stated he didn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The author had been planning for a long time and thinks it's too late to cancel. \n\nThe main issue here is about respecting someone's expressed wishes. Even if the friend had said it before, the author didn't take it seriously enough. The friend clearly communicated his disinterest, so the author should have listened. Planning a party in spite of that shows a lack of respect for the friend's preferences. \n\nAlso, the fact that the party is at the friend's house makes it worse because it's invading his personal space. Even if the author had a good intention, not considering the friend's feelings and boundaries is problematic. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Based on the analysis, the answer should be A because the author didn't listen to the friend's clear statements and proceeded with the party despite knowing it might make the friend upset. The fact that it's too late to cancel doesn't absolve the author of responsibility for not respecting the friend's wishes. \n\nSo the correct answer is A.\n"
