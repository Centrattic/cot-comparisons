      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. \n\nFirst, the friend has previously said he dislikes birthday parties. The author mentions that the friend said he was glad there wasn't a party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at the friend's house, so the friend will be there. The author planned it for a long time and it's too late to cancel now.\n\nHmm, the key points here are that the friend explicitly expressed not wanting a party, even if he had said it before. The author ignored those direct statements. Even if the friend had said those things before, the fact that he recently confirmed he hates parties and would be upset if there was one makes it clear. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. But the friend made it clear now. So, the author didn't listen. Planning a party despite that seems like a mistake. The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the problem because the friend is in their own space, and the author is making them uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, the fact that it's a surprise party means the friend can't prepare for it or back out. The author might have thought they were being nice by planning a surprise, but the friend clearly doesn't want it. So, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the friend's wishes, even if they had good intentions. \n\nThe answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
