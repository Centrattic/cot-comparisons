      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend had mentioned before that he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend is upset and the party is already planned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend had explicitly stated multiple times that he doesn't like birthday parties. The author, however, decided to go ahead with the party despite this, thinking maybe the friend was just trying to manage expectations. The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the conflict since the friend is now forced to be in a situation he didn't want.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author should have listened to the friend's preferences. Even if the author had good intentions, the friend's clear aversion to parties should have been a red flag. The friend might feel disrespected or ignored because his preferences were not taken seriously. Surprise parties can be stressful, and if someone has made it clear they don't want them, proceeding anyway could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the fact that the party is at his house makes it worse because he can't just leave. The author might have overestimated their knowledge of the friend's feelings and underestimated the friend's actual discomfort. Even if the author thought the friend was saying he didn't want a party to avoid disappointment, the friend's recent statement was more direct, indicating he would be mad if there was a party. The author should have taken that as a clear sign to cancel.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because they disregarded the friend's clear preferences and proceeded with a plan that the friend would find upsetting. The answer should be A.\n"
