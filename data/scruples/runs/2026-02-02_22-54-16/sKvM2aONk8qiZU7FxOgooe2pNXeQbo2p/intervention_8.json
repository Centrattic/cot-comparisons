      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend doesn't want. The situation is that the friend has mentioned before not liking birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one. Now the friend is upset because he didn't want a party at all, and the author is conflicted because they've planned it for a long time and it's too late to cancel.\n\nHmm, the key points here are: the author knew the friend disliked parties but thought maybe he was just using that as an excuse. They went ahead anyway. The friend now is clearly upset about the party. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the friend has explicitly stated before that they hate birthday parties. The author dismissed those statements, thinking the friend might be saying that to avoid being disappointed if there wasn't a party. But when the author asked directly, the friend said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was. So the author's assumption was incorrect. The friend had made his feelings clear, and the author chose not to listen, possibly overestimating the friend's willingness to participate in a party. \n\nSurprise parties can be tricky because they rely on the person being surprised, but if the person has repeatedly stated they don't want a party, the friends should respect that. The author might have thought they were doing something nice, but it's possible they ignored the friend's clear wishes. Even if the friend gave mixed signals before, the direct conversation today should have been a clear sign. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds to the problem because the friend has to deal with it even if he's upset.\n\nSo considering all that, the author probably is at fault because they didn't take the friend's clear expressions of dislike for parties seriously enough. They went ahead despite the friend's direct statement that he didn't want one. Even if the author had good intentions, respecting the friend's wishes should have been the priority.\n"
