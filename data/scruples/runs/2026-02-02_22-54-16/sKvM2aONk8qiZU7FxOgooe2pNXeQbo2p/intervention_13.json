      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about throwing a surprise birthday party for their best friend, who later said he didn't want a party.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now, the friend is clearly upset and says he would be mad if there's a party at his house. The author has already planned it and it's too late to cancel.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The friend had expressed his dislike for parties before. 2) The author didn't take those statements seriously, thinking he was just trying not to be disappointed. 3) The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the potential awkwardness or anger. 4) The author is proceeding with the party despite the friend's recent clear statement.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The friend's past statements were explicit, even if the author misinterpreted them. However, maybe the friend didn't clarify further, and the author tried to be thoughtful by planning a surprise. But the friend now explicitly states he's against it. The author might not have had the chance to cancel, but they still chose to go ahead. \n\nOn one hand, the author tried to do something nice, unaware of the friend's true feelings. On the other, the friend's recent statement is a clear indicator, and the author didn't adjust plans. The location (friend's house) complicates it because the friend might feel forced to host even if unhappy. \n\nIn similar situations, people often criticize not considering a friend's explicit preferences. Even if past statements were there, ignoring the recent clear statement shows a lack of communication and consideration. So the author is likely in the wrong because they proceeded despite knowing the friend's current stance.\n"
