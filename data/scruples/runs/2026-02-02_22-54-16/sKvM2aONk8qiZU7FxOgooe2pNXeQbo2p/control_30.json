      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who planned the surprise party is in the wrong. The scenario is that they organized a party for their best friend's birthday, but the friend told them he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The friend has mentioned before he hates parties, but the planner thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one. Now the party is planned, and it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the planner made a mistake. The friend clearly communicated his dislike for birthday parties multiple times. The planner, however, didn't take that into account and proceeded with the party, thinking maybe the friend was just being modest. The problem here is that the planner might have ignored the friend's explicit wishes, even if they were stated in the past. It's important to respect someone's preferences, especially if they've mentioned them before. Even if the planner thought the friend was lying to avoid disappointment, the friend's current statement is clear. The party is at the friend's house, so the friend would be uncomfortable or angry. The planner's actions could lead to the friend being upset, which is a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the planner might argue that it's a surprise and they wanted to make the friend happy. But the friend has a history of disliking parties, so maybe the planner should have respected that. It seems like the planner didn't listen to the friend's direct communication today, which is a key point. The fact that they've known the friend's feelings for a while but still went ahead suggests they are at fault. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
