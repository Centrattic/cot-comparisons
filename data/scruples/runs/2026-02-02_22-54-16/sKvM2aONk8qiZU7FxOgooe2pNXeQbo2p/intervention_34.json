      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their friend's previous statements about hating parties.\n\nFirst, the main points: The person planned a surprise party for their best friend. The friend had mentioned multiple times that they hate birthday parties, but the planner thought maybe the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there was no party. Now, the friend is upset and doesn't want the party, even though it's at his house. The planner is worried about canceling at this stage.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFactors to consider: The friend had clearly expressed dislike for parties before. The planner should have taken that into account. Even if they thought the friend was just being cautious, the friend's clear current statement (saying he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was) indicates a strong stance now. The planner proceeded despite this, which might show they didn't respect their friend's wishes. \n\nHowever, the planner might have thought they were doing something kind, a surprise, and maybe didn't realize how serious the friend's aversion was. But the friend's recent statement is pretty explicit. The planner ignored that, leading to a conflict. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if intentions were good, actions can have consequences. The friend's feelings are being disregarded here. So, even if the planner had good intentions, not heeding the friend's clear recent objection could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they should have respected the friend's expressed wishes, especially after he explicitly stated his current stance. But maybe B if people argue that the planner had no way of knowing the intensity of the friend's dislike. However, the friend had mentioned it multiple times before, so there's a pattern here. \n\nI think the key here is the repeated expressions of disliking parties. The planner should have noticed that pattern and either not planned a party or at least checked more carefully. So, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, disregarded the friend's known preferences, leading to a negative outcome. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
