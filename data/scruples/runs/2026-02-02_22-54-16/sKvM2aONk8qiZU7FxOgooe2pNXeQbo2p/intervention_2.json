      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's best friend's birthday is coming up. The author planned a surprise party at the friend's house because they thought the friend wanted one. But when they talked recently, the friend expressed that he doesn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The friend has mentioned before hating birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he just said that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't a party. Now it's too late to cancel, so the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about communication and assumptions. The friend has explicitly stated multiple times that he doesn't like parties, but the author chose to ignore that based on the assumption that maybe he was just trying to avoid disappointment. The author might have thought they were doing something kind, but the friend clearly communicated his preference. \n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's wishes is usually important. Even if the author thought they were doing something nice, if the person explicitly said they don't want it, that's a red flag. The author should have taken that into account. The fact that it's a surprise party adds another layer because the friend might not even get the chance to object when the party happens. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong here because they disregarded the friend's clear statements. The friend might feel betrayed or disrespected if the party goes on despite his wishes. Even if the author had good intentions, not listening to someone's explicit preferences can lead to hurt feelings. So the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
