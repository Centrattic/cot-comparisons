      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise birthday party for their best friend, even though the friend expressed not wanting a party. The friend said he hates birthday parties and that he would be mad if there was one. The person thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is about respecting someone's wishes, especially a close friend. The friend had clearly stated multiple times before not liking parties, but the person didn't take it seriously. They thought maybe the friend was just trying to avoid being let down if there wasn't a party. But now the friend is upset because there is a party planned at his house.\n\nI need to think about what the friend's actual preferences were. If he explicitly said he doesn't like birthday parties, even if it was in the past, that's a clear indication. The person planning the party might have dismissed those statements as the friend's way of handling expectations. But maybe they should have taken those statements more seriously. \n\nAlso, the party is at the friend's house, which could make the situation worse because he's hosting it but doesn't want it. That's a bit of a conflict. The person planning might not realize how uncomfortable the friend is feeling. \n\nThe key points are whether the person ignored clear communication from their friend and if they should have honored those preferences. Even if the friend had said it before, it's still valid. The person's defense is that they thought the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment, but maybe that's a misunderstanding. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if you know someone's preferences and still go against them, especially in a close friendship, you're likely in the wrong. Planning a party they don't want at their house without confirming their current feelings now seems inconsiderate. \n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their friend's expressed wishes despite knowing them, leading to the friend's anger. Even if they thought the friend was just saying it to avoid disappointment, they should have made sure or at least not proceed without checking again.\n"
