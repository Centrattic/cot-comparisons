      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person asked if they're in the wrong for throwing a surprise birthday party for their best friend, even though the friend didn't want a party. The friend has mentioned hating parties before, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset and the party is already planned.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author knew the friend had expressed dislike for parties before but chose to ignore that. They tried to plan a surprise, which can be a nice gesture, but the friend specifically said he would be mad if there was a party. The party is at his house, which makes it even more intrusive. \n\nEven though the author had been planning for a long time, the main issue is that they disregarded the friend's clear preferences. The friend has the right to not want a party, and the author should have respected that. The fact that they thought the friend was just saying it to avoid disappointment shows a lack of consideration. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't listen to the friend's explicit wishes, leading to a situation where the friend is upset. The answer should be A.\n"
