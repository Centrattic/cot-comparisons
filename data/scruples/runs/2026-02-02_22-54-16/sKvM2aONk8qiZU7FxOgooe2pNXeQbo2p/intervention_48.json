      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for throwing a surprise party for their best friend, even though the friend said he doesn't want a party. The friend previously mentioned hating birthday parties, but the author thought maybe he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there wasn't one. Now the friend is upset because he didn't want the party at all.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about respecting someone's boundaries and prior statements. Even if the author thought the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment, the friend had clearly stated multiple times that he hates parties. The author ignored those clear signals and went ahead with planning, which led to the friend being angry. \n\nSo, did the author make a mistake here? Well, if someone explicitly says they don't want a party, even if you think they might be lying or trying to hide their true feelings, it's their right to express their preferences. The author might not have intended to upset the friend, but the friend's feelings are valid. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds another layer because it's a personal space, and the friend now has to deal with something they didn't want. \n\nEven though the author put a lot of effort into planning, the friend's comfort and wishes should take precedence. The author didn't take the friend's repeated statements seriously enough. So, while the intention was good, the action of ignoring the friend's clear boundaries is where the mistake lies. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
