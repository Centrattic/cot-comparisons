      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party for their best friend. The friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now the friend is upset because he didn't want a party at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author planned a surprise party despite the friend's past statements. The friend explicitly said he didn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so he can't avoid it. The author thought the friend was just saying he didn't like parties to manage expectations if there wasn't a party. But the friend actually meant it, and now the author is going through with the party even though it's too late to cancel.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend had clearly expressed his dislike for parties multiple times. The author might have known this but dismissed the friend's feelings, thinking he was just being modest. That's a common mistake where people misinterpret others' statements. However, the friend was explicit this time, saying he would be angry if there was a party. The author ignored that warning. \n\nSurprise parties are tricky because they rely on the guest of honor not knowing. But if the person has made it clear they don't want a party, even if they said it in the past, the author should have respected that. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds to the problem because it's his space and he's now forced to host something he doesn't want. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they've been planning for a long time and it's too late to cancel. But that doesn't justify proceeding if it's against the friend's wishes. Respect for someone's feelings and boundaries is more important than the effort put into planning. \n\nSo, in this case, the author didn't listen to the friend's clear statements and proceeded with a party that the friend didn't want. Even though the friend might have said he disliked parties before, the author should have taken those statements seriously instead of assuming they were just hypothetical. The friend's explicit statement today should have been a red flag. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the friend's wishes and going ahead with the party despite knowing it would upset him.\n"
