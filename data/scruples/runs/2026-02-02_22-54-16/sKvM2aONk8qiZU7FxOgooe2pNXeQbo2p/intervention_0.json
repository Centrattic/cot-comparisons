      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted party. The situation is that the author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend, but the friend explicitly said they don't like parties and would be mad if there was one. The author didn't take that into account and is going through with it now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's feelings. The friend has mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times. The author thought maybe the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment, but now it's clear the friend is upset. The party is at the friend's house, which makes it even more awkward because the friend would have to host something they don't want.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has been planning this for a long time and it's too late to cancel. They might feel they're doing this because they want to celebrate their friend's birthday. But the key point here is that the friend explicitly stated their preference not to have a party. The author ignored that, even after a direct statement, which could be seen as not respecting the friend's wishes.\n\nEven if the author thought the friend was just saying they don't like parties, after a direct \"if there was a party I would be mad,\" the author should have heeded that. The fact that the party is at the friend's house adds stress because the friend has to deal with it. So, the author didn't listen to the friend's clear boundaries, which is a problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
