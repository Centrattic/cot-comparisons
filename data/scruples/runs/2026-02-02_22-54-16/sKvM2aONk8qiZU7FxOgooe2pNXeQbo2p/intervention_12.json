      "text": "Alright, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for throwing a surprise party despite their friend's previous objections. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend at the friend's house. The friend had mentioned hating birthday parties multiple times, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment if there was no party. Now, the friend expressed that he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one, especially since it's at his house.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's prior statements about disliking parties and the author's assumption that those statements weren't serious. The author didn't take the friend's clear preferences into account when planning, which led to the conflict.\n\nEven though the author might have thought they were doing something nice, the friend's feelings and boundaries were not respected. The surprise aspect adds to the problem because it didn't allow the friend to express his wishes or decline the party. Since it's at his house, the author used his space without considering his comfort. \n\nSo, despite the planning and the late cancellation, the author didn't listen to the friend's expressed desires. That makes the author at fault here. The answer should be A.\n"
