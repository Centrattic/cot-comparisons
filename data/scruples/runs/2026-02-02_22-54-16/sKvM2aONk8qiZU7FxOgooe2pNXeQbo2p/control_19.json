      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want.\n\nFirst, the friend's birthday is coming up, and the author planned a surprise party. But in their conversation, the friend was clear that he didn't want a party and would be mad if there was one. The author mentions that the friend had previously said he hates birthday parties, but thought the friend was just saying that so he wouldn't be disappointed if there was no party. Now, the author is conflicted because they've been planning it for a while and it's too late to cancel.\n\nHmm. The key points here are that the friend explicitly stated he didn't want a party, and the author knew about his dislike before. Even though the friend had said it before, maybe the author didn't take it seriously. Now, the friend is upset, and the party is at his house, which makes it worse because the friend has to deal with it at his own home. \n\nSo, the author went ahead with the party despite the friend's clear wishes. Even if they thought the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment before, the friend's recent statement was explicit. The author should have respected that. Planning a party in secret when the person has repeatedly expressed not wanting one seems like a breach of trust. \n\nThe friend's feelings are important here. The author's actions are causing the friend to be upset, and since the party is at the friend's house, it's even more intrusive. The author might have thought they were being kind by throwing a party, but ignoring the friend's clear preferences is a mistake. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author didn't consider the friend's feelings and proceeded anyway. So, they are in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
