      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party despite their best friend's previous statements about hating birthday parties.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author planned a surprise party for their best friend's birthday. They were excited, but when they talked to the friend recently, he expressed that he would be mad if there was a party. The party is at his house, which adds to the problem because he can't just leave. The author mentions that the friend has said before he hates parties, but they thought he was just trying not to be disappointed if there wasn't one. Now the party is too late to cancel, and they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend has a history of expressing dislike for parties, but the author didn't take that seriously enough. The friend now explicitly said he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The author is proceeding with the party, which is at the friend's house, making the situation more complicated.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. From a social perspective, respecting someone's wishes is important, even if they've stated them before. The friend made it clear he doesn't like parties, and now he's explicitly telling the author he would be angry. Even if the author thought the friend was just trying to avoid disappointment, the friend's recent message should have been a clear sign. Planning a party at the friend's house without considering this is a risk.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that it's a surprise and they wanted to celebrate their friend's birthday, thinking the friend would appreciate it despite his previous statements. But the friend is now clearly upset about it, which is a red flag. The fact that the party is at his house adds to the pressure because he can't just leave, which could make the situation uncomfortable or hurtful for the friend.\n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's expressed preferences is usually expected. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, even if done with good intentions. The friend's feelings are being overridden, and the author is proceeding without considering the friend's current feelings, even though it's too late to cancel. This could damage the friendship, and the author might be seen as not listening to their friend's boundaries.\n\nSo, balancing the intention (to celebrate a friend's birthday) against the action (ignoring the friend's clear wishes), the author's actions might be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be AITA for the author, meaning they are in the wrong.\n"
