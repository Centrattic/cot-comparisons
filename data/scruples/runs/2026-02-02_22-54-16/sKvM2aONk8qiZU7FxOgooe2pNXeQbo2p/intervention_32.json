      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for throwing a surprise party that their best friend didn't want. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend at the friend's house. The friend mentioned he hates birthday parties and was glad there wasn't one, and would be mad if there was. The author had been planning this for a while and now it's too late to cancel.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the details given. The key points here are: the friend clearly expressed his dislike for parties multiple times, the author chose to ignore those statements, and the party is at his house, which adds to the friend's potential anger.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? Well, the friend had stated his preferences clearly. Even if the author thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment, the friend's actual response was clear. The author didn't confirm the friend's preferences closer to the event, maybe assuming past statements were just hypothetical. However, repeatedly stated dislikes about parties should have been a red flag. The author's intent was good\u2014to make the friend happy\u2014but the execution overlooked the friend's explicit wishes. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have been testing the author's commitment or just expressing aversion in a way that's not absolute. But given that the author was aware of the dislike and proceeded regardless, especially when the party is at the friend's home, which complicates things, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that the friend was explicit in his recent statement (\"glad there's no party\" and \"would be mad af\") suggests that the author didn't take those recent and clear signals seriously. \n\nIn some cases, friends might have different views over time, but the author didn't check in again after the initial planning. The planning being too late to cancel doesn't excuse not respecting the friend's current wishes. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's current feelings despite prior knowledge. So the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong).\n"
