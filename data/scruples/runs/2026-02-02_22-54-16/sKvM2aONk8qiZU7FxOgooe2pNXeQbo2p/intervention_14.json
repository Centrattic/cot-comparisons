      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted birthday party. The situation is that the author planned a surprise party for their best friend's birthday. The friend didn't want a party, mentioned hating them before, but the author didn't take it seriously. Now the friend is upset, and the author is wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was good; they wanted to celebrate their friend's birthday. Surprise parties can be a nice gesture, but they require knowing the recipient's preferences. The friend had expressed not liking parties multiple times, which the author might have overlooked. Even if the friend said those things to avoid disappointment, the author should have listened and respected that. Planning a party at the friend's house is an added issue because it's their space and they might feel invaded. The author also mentions it's too late to cancel, which complicates things. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought the friend was just being modest or didn't want to hurt their feelings by saying no. But the friend explicitly mentioned being glad there's no party and getting mad if there is one. That's pretty clear. The author didn't check in again after previous statements, which shows a lack of attention to the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions, not respecting the friend's clear preferences is a mistake. The friend's well-being and comfort should be a priority. The author should have either had a different kind of celebration or confirmed the friend's feelings again before proceeding. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
