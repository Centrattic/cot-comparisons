      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for throwing a surprise party despite their friend's previous dislike of birthday parties. \n\nFirst, the friend mentioned multiple times that he hates birthday parties. However, the author thought the friend was just trying to manage expectations if there was no party. Now, after planning for a while, the friend is upset because he didn't want the party.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The author knew the friend disliked parties but thought the friend was just saying that to avoid disappointment. The party is at the friend's house, which adds to the potential for conflict since the friend might feel intruded upon. \n\nThe author's intention was to do something nice, but they didn't heed the friend's clear preferences. Even if the friend is being dramatic, the author should have respected the expressed wishes. Surprise parties can sometimes go against someone's preferences, so not checking in properly here was a mistake. The fact that it's too late to cancel might not excuse the oversight. \n\nSo the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong because they ignored the friend's clear statements and proceeded without considering the friend's feelings.\n"
