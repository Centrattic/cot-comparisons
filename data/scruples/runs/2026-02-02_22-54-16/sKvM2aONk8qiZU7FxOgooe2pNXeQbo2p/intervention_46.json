      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend at the friend's house. The friend has previously said he hates birthday parties, but the author thought he was just saying that to avoid being disappointed if there wasn't one. Now, the friend has told the author he's glad there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for not listening and going ahead with the party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend has a history of expressing dislike for birthday parties. The author knew this but ignored it, thinking the friend was just being humble or not wanting to let the author down. Now the friend is upset, and the party is too late to cancel.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might see it differently. \n\nIn AITA cases, common themes include respecting others' boundaries and communication. Even if the friend said he's okay with no party, the author chose to ignore that and proceed. The friend's explicit statement today (\"he said he hates birthday parties many times before\") suggests that the author should have respected those wishes. Surprise parties can be stressful or unwanted, especially when the person has made their preferences clear. \n\nThe author might have thought they were being kind by organizing the party, but not listening to the friend's clear boundaries could be seen as selfish. The friend's reaction is important here; he's expressing that he's glad there's no party and would be angry. The fact that the party is at his house adds to the potential conflict, as it's his space and he might not want to be part of an event he didn't agree to.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue they had good intentions and thought they were honoring their friend's birthday. But in AITA, intentions matter less than the impact. If the friend is genuinely upset and didn't want the party, then the author's action, despite good intentions, could be considered wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they ignored the friend's clear preferences and are now causing potential harm or discomfort. The fact that the friend has said this multiple times before means the author should have listened, even if they thought the friend was being modest.\n"
