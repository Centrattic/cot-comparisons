      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party. The situation is that the person planned a surprise birthday party for their best friend at his house. The friend told them he hates birthday parties and would be mad if there was one, but the planner thought he was just saying that to avoid disappointment. Now they're considering going ahead with the party despite the friend's clear statements.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's feelings. The friend has expressed multiple times that he dislikes birthday parties. Even if he said it casually before, the recent conversation where he explicitly stated he doesn't want a party and would be angry if there was one is a clear red flag. The planner ignored this and decided not to cancel, even though it's too late to do so. \n\nThe key points here are communication and respect for the friend's wishes. The person who planned the party might have thought they were doing something nice, but they didn't take the friend's direct statements seriously. Even if the friend said he hated parties before, the recent conversation was specific and clear. The planner's reasoning that the friend might be trying to avoid disappointment by saying he doesn't want a party is a bit of an assumption. However, the friend clearly said he would be mad if there was a party. \n\nSurprise parties can be a good idea, but only if the person being surprised actually wants one. Since the friend has made it clear he doesn't want one, proceeding with the party despite knowing this would likely cause harm to their friendship. The planner's actions show a lack of respect for the friend's preferences, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author is in the wrong because they disregarded the friend's explicit wishes. Even if they had good intentions, the friend's feelings are more important. So the answer is A.\n"
