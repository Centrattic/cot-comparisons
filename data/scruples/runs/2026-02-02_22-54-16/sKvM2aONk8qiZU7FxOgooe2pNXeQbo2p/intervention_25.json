      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for throwing an unwanted surprise party at their best friend's birthday. The author planned the party despite the friend previously saying he hates birthday parties. The friend now says he's happy there's no party and would be mad if there was one. The party is at his house, so he'll be there. The author thought the friend was just saying he didn't want a party to avoid disappointment.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here: The friend didn't explicitly say no to a party before, but mentioned hating them. The author assumed the friend was just being humble or didn't want to be a downer. But now the friend is upset that the party is happening. The author is going through with it because it's too late to cancel.\n\nFirst, respect for a friend's stated preferences. Even if the friend said he hates parties, if he never explicitly said not to throw one, maybe the author tried to be nice. But on the other hand, knowing that someone dislikes parties and then going against their expressed wishes could be problematic. The friend's clear message now is that he doesn't want it. The author didn't listen to his past statements, which were multiple. The author might have thought they were being considerate by planning a party, but that might have been a misinterpretation. \n\nThe surprise party is at the friend's house, which is a big deal because the host is there. The friend's presence might make the party uncomfortable for him. The author is now in a position where they can't back out, so they have to go through with it despite the friend's current feelings. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have asked more directly if the friend wanted a party, even if he said he hated them before. Maybe the friend's previous statements were a clear enough indicator. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's preferences, even if they were stated indirectly. But if the author had good intentions, maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the friend's current reaction shows he's upset, which suggests the author overstepped. So probably answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
