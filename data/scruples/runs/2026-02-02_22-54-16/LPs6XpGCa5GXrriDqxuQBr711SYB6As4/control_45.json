      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author went on a date with a girl he met on OkCupid. He picked her up because she doesn't drive, paid for dinner, and then asked if they could go out again. She said she's not looking to date anyone and that she just likes meeting new people. The author then told her to get an Uber and left. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations here. The author paid for the date, which is a common practice, and when the date didn't go as he hoped (since she wasn't interested in dating), he left her to take an Uber. Now, the question is whether that's rude or inconsiderate.\n\nWhen you pay for a date, there's often an unspoken expectation that you'll help the person get home, especially if you picked them up. In this case, the author picked her up, which implies he took responsibility for her transportation. By leaving her to get an Uber, he might be seen as abandoning her, even if she's not interested in another date. \n\nBut wait, did she ask for a ride back? Or did he just assume she needed one? She doesn't drive, so she probably needs transportation. If he offered to take her home but she declined, that's different. However, the author says he told her to get an Uber and left. That sounds abrupt. Even if the date didn't go well, it's polite to offer a ride home, especially since he picked her up in the first place. \n\nAnother angle: the woman said she's not looking to date, so maybe she didn't expect the author to stick around. But regardless of the date's outcome, ensuring her safety and providing a ride home is considerate. Leaving her to find an Uber could be seen as thoughtless, especially if she's in an unfamiliar area or it's late. \n\nHowever, some might argue that once the date is over and the conversation has ended, the obligation is done. If she didn't ask for a ride, maybe it's not his responsibility. But since he initiated the pickup, he might be expected to follow through. \n\nAlso, the author's actions might come off as abrupt or dismissive. Instead of just telling her to get an Uber, maybe he should have offered to take her home, even if he felt hurt. That would show maturity and consideration beyond the immediate emotions of the situation. \n\nIn summary, while the woman's actions might have been frustrating, the author's response of telling her to get an Uber without offering a ride could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
