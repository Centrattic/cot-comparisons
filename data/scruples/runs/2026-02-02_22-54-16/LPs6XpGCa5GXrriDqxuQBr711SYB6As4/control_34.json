      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their date to get an Uber after the date didn't go as planned. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person met a girl on OkCupid, asked her out, and she agreed. Since she doesn't drive, he picked her up and took her to a restaurant. The date was going well, but when it ended, he paid the bill and asked when they could go out again. She said she wasn't looking to date, but he asked why she came on the date then, and she replied she likes meeting new people. He then told her to get an Uber home and left.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's actions were appropriate. The girl wasn't interested in a relationship but still went on the date. The author paid for the meal, which is a common courtesy, but then when she made it clear she wasn't interested, he left her to get an Uber. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone is not interested in a relationship, it's still polite to offer a ride or transportation, especially if they don't drive. However, in this case, the author did pick her up initially. After the date, when she says she's not looking to date, maybe he felt used or like he was being led on. But cutting her off by not offering a ride home might be seen as abrupt or rude.\n\nBut wait, the key point is that he already picked her up. Did he have a responsibility to take her home? If she didn't drive, maybe he expected to take her back. But when the date ended on a confusing note (she said she likes meeting new people), perhaps he was upset and decided to leave. However, leaving her to get an Uber when she can't drive might be problematic. It's not just about being kind, but also about practical considerations. Uber can be unreliable or expensive, and she might not have a car, so expecting her to Uber home might not be the best response, especially if she's in an unknown or unsafe area.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt that since she wasn't interested in dating, it was unnecessary to take her home. But that's a bit harsh. Even if someone isn't interested in a relationship, it's still polite to offer a ride. The fact that she didn't drive and he picked her up initially might mean she expected him to take her back. \n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as a way to express disappointment. He might have felt that she wasted his time by not being honest upfront. But instead of confronting her or ending the date politely, he left her to Uber. That could be inconsiderate, especially if she wasn't planning for that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. If he had no prior arrangement and she didn't have a car, then leaving her without a ride might be rude. But if he felt that she used him and he was just cutting her off immediately, maybe he's justified in his decision but handled it poorly. \n\nIn some cases, people might say that after a date, even if it didn't lead to a relationship, you should still make sure the person gets home safely. However, in this case, the author did the opposite. So, perhaps the answer is A, he is in the wrong because he should have offered a ride or at least arranged for her to get home safely. But the girl's behavior was also questionable for leading him on. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically about the author's actions. Even if the girl was dishonest, the author's action of telling her to get an Uber and leaving might be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he didn't offer to take her home, despite knowing she can't drive, which might have been a responsibility he took on by picking her up initially. His reaction, while perhaps understandable given her response, was not the most considerate or polite way to handle it.\n"
