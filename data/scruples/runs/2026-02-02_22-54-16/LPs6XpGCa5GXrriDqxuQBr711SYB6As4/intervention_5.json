      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling a date to get an Uber. Here's the situation:\n\nThe author set up a date through OkCupid. They picked up the girl because she doesn't drive, took her to a restaurant, paid the check, and when she said she wasn't looking to date, he asked why she came on the date. She responded that she likes meeting new people. Then the author told her to get an Uber home and left.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let's consider the key points. The girl stated she's not looking for a relationship, so the date might have been a one-time thing for her. The author was possibly expecting a future relationship, as he asked when they could go out again. When she clarified her intentions, the author felt misled and left abruptly.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The author's actions: he picked her up, paid, then after the rejection, told her to take Uber. The main issue here is the author's response after the date. Telling someone to get an Uber might come off as abrupt or dismissive, especially if done without a polite goodbye. However, given that she didn't want a relationship, maybe the author felt justified in ending the interaction quickly. \n\nBut is it wrong? Well, even if the date didn't go as expected, the proper etiquette would be to say goodbye politely, maybe offer to drive her home, unless they have a reason not to. In this case, the author did pick her up, so maybe he was still responsible for getting her home. However, he might have felt hurt or rejected, leading to the abrupt exit. \n\nThe girl's actions could be seen as leading him on by not clarifying her intentions upfront. But the author also has the right to feel upset if he invested time and effort. The key is whether the author's response was inconsiderate. Telling someone to take Uber immediately after the rejection might be seen as cutting things off rudely. However, considering the circumstances, maybe it's a valid way to end the encounter. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author ended the date abruptly without a proper farewell, that's a problem. But if he's just ending the date and not being unkind, maybe not. The line between being polite and ending the date on his terms is thin. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal opinions. Some might say the author was justified in ending things quickly after realizing her intentions. Others might say he should have handled it with more grace, regardless of her actions.\n"
