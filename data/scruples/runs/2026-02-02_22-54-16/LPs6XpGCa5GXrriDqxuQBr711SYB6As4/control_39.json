      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went on a date with a girl he picked up because she doesn't drive. The date went well, but when he asked when they could go out again, she said she's not looking to date. He then told her to get an Uber and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy made an effort by picking her up, which is thoughtful. The woman was upfront that she's not looking for a relationship but still agreed to the date. When the author asks for a follow-up, she clarifies her stance. His response was to leave and suggest she take an Uber. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the author acted inappropriately. Was it wrong to not offer to drive her home after she didn't reciprocate his interest? Some might argue that since she wasn't interested, he had the right to end the date and not offer further help. Others might think that since he picked her up, he should have driven her back regardless of her interest. \n\nBut wait, she doesn't drive, so Uber might not be an option she's comfortable with. The author left her to figure out transportation on her own. That could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially if she's not familiar with Uber. However, he might have felt hurt and decided to cut the interaction short. \n\nAnother angle: the author was clear about his intent to pursue a relationship, and she was clear she wasn't interested. He might have felt disrespected and left abruptly. But his response was to not help her get home. Is that holding a grudge? \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was a proportionate response. If the woman was honest from the start, the author's reaction might be seen as justified. But if he felt disrespected and left her in a lurch, that's on him. \n\nI think the key points are: the author made an effort by picking her up, she was honest about her intentions, and he left the date by not driving her home. Whether that's wrong depends on expectations. Some might say he overreacted, others that she should have considered his feelings when declining. \n\nBut since she didn't drive, maybe he had a responsibility to drive her back. By not doing so, he left her to find another way. That could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if he was hurt and left, it's a personal choice. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether not offering a ride home is inconsiderate. If the author felt wronged, his reaction is understandable, but leaving her without a ride could be seen as wrong. The community often values kindness even in rejection. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not ensuring her safe transport regardless of the date's outcome.\n"
