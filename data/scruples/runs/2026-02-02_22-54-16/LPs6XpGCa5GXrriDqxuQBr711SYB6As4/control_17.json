      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their date to get an Uber after she said she wasn't looking to date anyone.\n\nFirst, let's outline the situation. The author met someone on OkCupid, picked her up because she doesn't drive, had dinner, paid, and asked when they could go out again. She said she wasn't looking to date, then he told her to get an Uber and left. \n\nSo, the key points here are the sequence of events and the author's actions. The user is asking if the author was wrong in sending her an Uber instead of offering to drive her home, especially after the date ended on a negative note.\n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. Typically, after a date, especially if it's the first one, it's customary to be polite and ensure the other person gets home safely. Even if the date didn't go well, the gentlemanly thing to do would be to drive them home or help arrange transportation. \n\nIn this case, the author had already picked her up, which implies he was responsible for her getting there. When the date ended, she might not have been in a position to get home on her own. By suggesting an Uber, he's leaving her to handle the logistics, which could be seen as abrupt or dismissive, especially after she rejected his interest in a future relationship.\n\nBut wait, the user says \"AITA for telling a date to get an Uber?\" So the author is questioning if it was wrong to not offer to drive her home. If she doesn't drive, then suggesting Uber might be the only option, unless the author was willing to drive her home himself. However, if he was okay with driving her there but not back, that might be seen as rude. \n\nThe problem is that after she said she wasn't interested in dating, the author might have felt upset and left quickly. But the expectation is that you'd still be polite and assist her in getting home. If the author was angry or upset, telling her to get an Uber instead of offering to drive her might come off as cold or inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, considering that he picked her up, the natural assumption is that he would also drop her off. If he didn't want to drive her home, maybe he should have arranged for her to get home safely in another way, like helping with Uber or even driving her if he was willing. But by just telling her to get an Uber, he might be perceived as being abrupt and not considering her convenience or feelings.\n\nAnother angle: if she doesn't drive, she might rely on others for transportation. If he was the one who picked her up, it's reasonable to expect that he would also drop her off, unless she has other means. But since she doesn't drive, Uber becomes her option, so maybe the author isn't at fault for not driving her home if that's beyond his willingness. But social expectations often dictate that you should take someone home after a date, regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn some cultures or contexts, it's considered rude to leave someone stranded. Since he started the date by picking her up, he has a responsibility to ensure she gets home safely. If he left her with the task of getting an Uber immediately after the date ended on a bad note, that could be seen as insensitive. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't offer to drive her home, which could be seen as a breach of social etiquette, especially after the date didn't go as he hoped. Alternatively, if he wasn't willing to drive her home, then telling her to get an Uber is a practical solution, but the way he did it might be considered abrupt. \n\nBut the main issue is whether it's customary to drive someone home after a date, even if it ended badly. If the answer is yes, then not doing so might make him at fault. So, the answer would be A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't ensure her safe return, which is expected after a date.\n"
