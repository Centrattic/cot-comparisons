      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author set up a date via OkCupid, picked up the date because she doesn't drive, had a good time, paid, and asked when they could go again. The date said she wasn't looking to date, but liked meeting people. The author then told her to get an Uber and left.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author arranged the date, covered the cost, and made sure she got home. The date was clear she's not interested in a relationship, but maybe wanted casual interaction. The author's action of leaving her to get an Uber might be seen as abrupt or insensitive, especially since he picked her up earlier. But maybe he felt hurt or wanted to end the night on his terms after she declined a future date.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not. If the date was clear about her intentions, the author might have felt it was okay to cut the conversation short. However, leaving her to Uber home after picking her up could be seen as a bit selfish or not considering her potential discomfort. But since he offered her a ride initially, but then left her to Uber, maybe that's where it goes wrong. Did he give her a choice to Uber or ride back with him? The post says he told her to get an Uber and left, which could be abrupt if she expected a ride home.\n\nBut considering that she wasn't looking for a date and maybe didn't want to continue the interaction, the author might have felt justified in ending it quickly. However, leaving without offering a ride home after he picked her up might be inconsiderate. So there's a balance between his right to end things and her need for safe transport. If she didn't drive and relied on him, leaving her without a ride might be problematic. But if he offered a ride and she declined, then it's fine. The post says he told her to get an Uber, implying she had to arrange her own transport, which he might have been upset about after she stood him up.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't offer to drive her home, leaving her stranded or needing to use Uber when he had picked her up. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if he felt justified in ending the date and she was responsible for her own transport. It's a bit ambiguous, but typically, if you pick someone up, it's polite to drive them back. If he left her to Uber, maybe he's wrong. But if she wanted to end the date and he left, maybe not. The key is whether he provided a ride home. Since he didn't, and she doesn't drive, that's a problem. So probably A.\n"
