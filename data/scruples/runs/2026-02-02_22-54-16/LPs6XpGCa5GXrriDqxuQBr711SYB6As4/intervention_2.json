      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this.\n\nThe user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling a date to get an Uber. The situation is that they met on OkCupid, he picked her up because she doesn't drive, and after paying, he asked when they could go out again. She said she wasn't looking to date and that she just likes meeting new people. He then told her to get an Uber and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. When someone goes on a date, especially when they're not driving, it's common for the other person to offer a ride home. The author did that, but after the conversation where she clarified she's not interested in dating, he decided to leave and let her take an Uber. \n\nIs it wrong to stop offering a ride home after she says she's not looking for a relationship? Well, the ride home is separate from the dating intention. Even if she's not interested in a relationship, it's still considerate to offer a ride. However, the author might have felt hurt or disrespected, leading him to walk away. \n\nBut the key point is, he paid for the meal, asked when they could meet again, and when she declined, he told her to take an Uber. Did he have an obligation to give her a ride regardless of the date's outcome? Maybe, but it's also possible that he felt used or wanted to set boundaries. \n\nIn some cultures, it's expected to provide a ride home for safety, but if she can handle an Uber, maybe that's her choice. The problem is whether he was rude or abrupt. Telling her to get an Uber could come off as dismissive, especially right after she ended the date. Instead of leaving immediately, a more polite approach might be to say he's happy to drive her home even if they're not dating. \n\nBut the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe they see it as not his fault for not continuing to pretend. However, the act of leaving her to arrange her own ride without offering a ride might be seen as abrupt. So, is he being inconsiderate, or is he setting a boundary? It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nI think the answer depends on intent and tone. If he was trying to be helpful by suggesting Uber, maybe not wrong. But if he was angry or abrupt, then yes. Since the description doesn't mention any conflict during the ride, maybe he just ended the conversation there. So, perhaps he's in the right because she was not interested, and he's moving on. But others might argue that he should have been more considerate regardless. \n\nHmm. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I'm leaning towards B because the author's action is a bit of a reaction to her not wanting to date, but maybe it could have been handled more politely. However, since he did offer a ride and then left after the conversation, it's not necessarily wrong. The Uber suggestion is a practical solution, but the immediate exit might be seen as rude. But if he was hurt, maybe it's his prerogative. The user's initial thought is B, so maybe the community would agree. I'll go with B.\n"
