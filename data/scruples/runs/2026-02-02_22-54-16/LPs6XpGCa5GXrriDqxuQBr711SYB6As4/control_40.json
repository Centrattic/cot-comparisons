      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went on a date with a girl who doesn't drive, so he picked her up. After the date, she said she's not looking for a relationship, he asked why she came on the date, she said she likes meeting new people. Then he told her to get an Uber home and left.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are his response to her not wanting to date. She already stated she's not looking for a relationship, so the author felt led on? But she did agree to the date in the first place. Maybe he felt disrespected because she used him for just meeting someone. But he's the one who paid for the dinner and gave her a ride. Then, when she said she wasn't interested, he told her to Uber home. Was that harsh? Did he have to drop her off or was it okay to leave her to Uber?\n\nIn terms of etiquette, if someone is in a position where they provided transportation (since she doesn't drive), maybe it's expected to offer a ride home even after the date didn't work out. But the author might have felt that since she wasn't interested, he didn't want to spend more time or money. But she can't drive, so Uber would cost her money. Maybe the author was cutting her off as a way to express his feelings. Alternatively, maybe he was being abrupt and not considering her situation.\n\nIs telling someone to Uber home after a date where they don't have a car considered rude or inconsiderate? If the date went well initially, but she ended it, maybe the author was upset and took it out by not offering a ride. But she might not have money for an Uber. However, the author might not be obligated to give her a ride home if she's not interested. But culturally, it's common to offer a ride home even if the date is over. So maybe the author was wrong to not offer that and instead make her take an Uber she can't afford. But he might have been hurt and wanted to cut off the conversation. \n\nAnother angle: the girl said she likes meeting new people, so maybe she's not looking for a relationship and is just socializing. The author might have felt misled, so his reaction was about feeling used. But is it wrong to not offer a ride home? Maybe, because she can't drive. So he left her with the option of Uber, which is her responsibility. But if he was angry, maybe he should have handled it more gracefully. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether his action of sending her to Uber was a justified response or if it was cruel. Some might say he was right to not want to continue the date after she said she's not interested, but others might say he should have been polite and still offered a ride. Since she doesn't drive, maybe he should have considered that she might not have the means for Uber, but perhaps he was just trying to end the interaction. \n\nIn terms of AITA scenarios, often the person who responds in a hurtful way after being rejected is the one at fault. If the girl said she's not interested, the author's reaction of making her take an Uber might be seen as petty or inconsiderate. So maybe he's in the wrong. But if he didn't want to spend more time with her, maybe it's acceptable. \n\nBut considering she can't drive, and Uber might be expensive, maybe the author should have offered the ride home out of politeness, regardless of his feelings. So maybe he's at fault for not doing that. Therefore, answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But wait, some might argue that he's allowed to be upset and choose to leave. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the key is whether his action was wrong. Since he could have been polite and still offered a ride, but instead made her take an Uber as a way to cut ties, maybe he's wrong. So answer A.\n"
