She doesn\u2019t drive so I picked her up and we went out to a restaurant.  It was going well and I was enjoying getting to know her.  At the end I paid the check and asked her when we could go out again.  She told me she wasn\u2019t looking to date anyone right now.  I asked  her why did she come on a date with me then and she said that she just likes meeting new people.  I told her that she could catch an Uber home and left. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person on OkCupid asked the guy out, they had a good date. He paid, asked for a second date, and she said she's not looking to date. He then tells her to get an Uber and leaves. The question is whether he's in the wrong for that.\n\nFirst, she mentioned she doesn't drive, so he picked her up. That's considerate. After the date, when she says she's not interested in dating, he's probably feeling rejected. His response is to offer an Uber and leave. Is that appropriate?\n\nIn social norms, when someone isn't interested, the right thing is to respect their decision and end the interaction politely. He didn't argue, didn't pressure her, just made a practical suggestion for her to get home. Since she didn't have a car, Uber is a logical solution. He didn't make a scene or say anything hurtful. \n\nMaybe some might think he was abrupt, but considering the context\u2014she ended the conversation by stating she's not into dating\u2014his response seems measured. He's not forcing her to communicate further or acting out. Offering a ride home is standard, and Uber is a safe option. \n\nSo, I don't think he's in the wrong. He respected her boundaries and handled it with a practical approach. Answer B.\n"
