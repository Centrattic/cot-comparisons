At the end I paid the check and asked her when we could go out again.  She told me she wasn\u2019t looking to date anyone right now.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they went on a date, paid for the meal, and when the date said she wasn't looking for a relationship, he told her to get an Uber home and left.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author picked up the date because she doesn't drive, which was considerate. The date went well, but she ended it by saying she's not looking to date anyone. The author then offers an Uber ride home and leaves. \n\nThe question is whether telling her to get an Uber was wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should consider social norms here. Usually, after a date, it's common to offer a ride home, but if the date ended abruptly, maybe the author felt disappointed. However, using Uber instead of driving her might be seen as cutting things off. But the date herself said she's not interested, so maybe the author was just being practical. \n\nIs there any insensitivity? The author might have been upset but handled it by not prolonging the interaction. Alternatively, someone might argue that not offering to drive her home could be cold, but the date already said she doesn't drive, so Uber is a viable alternative. The author paid for the meal, so maybe they felt justified in leaving. \n\nAlso, the date's response\u2014\"just likes meeting new people\"\u2014could imply she wasn't serious from the start. The author's reaction might be a way to disengage politely. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were respecting her boundaries and found a practical solution. So the answer is B.\n"
