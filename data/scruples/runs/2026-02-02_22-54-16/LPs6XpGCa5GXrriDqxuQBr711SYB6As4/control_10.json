      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their date to get an Uber after the date didn't go as planned. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy set up a date through OkCupid, picked her up since she doesn't drive, they went to a restaurant. The date went well, he paid, and asked her out again. She said she wasn't looking to date but likes meeting new people. He then told her to take an Uber home and left. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's at fault. Let me think. When a date ends and the person isn't interested in a relationship, the expectation is that the other person will respect that. The guy was clear in asking when they could go out again, and she declined. He might have felt hurt or rejected. \n\nBut what did he do? Instead of staying polite, he told her to get an Uber and left. Was that rude? Well, she didn't drive, so maybe she expected him to give her a ride home. But she was the one who declined the relationship. If he felt she led him on or wasn't honest from the start, he might be justified in ending the interaction abruptly. However, regardless of her actions, treating her rudely by making her take an Uber could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn dating etiquette, even if things don't work out, maintaining respect is important. She might not have given a ride home, but he could have at least offered. By telling her to Uber, he's not being helpful. Maybe he was upset, but the action was abrupt. \n\nAlternatively, if she was just looking to meet people and wasn't honest about her intentions, then the guy might feel justified in not wanting to continue the interaction. But the problem is in how he handled the end of the date. \n\nSo, the key points: Did he have a right to be upset? Possibly. Did he respond inconsiderately? Yes. Even if she wasn't interested, he should have ensured she got home safely. His action might be seen as the wrong move because he prioritized his feelings over her safety or convenience. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But wait, another angle: if she was just using him to meet people and wasn't honest, then maybe he's not at fault. But the main issue is that he told her to Uber instead of offering a ride. If he left abruptly, that's disrespectful. So, I think the consensus would be that he's in the wrong because he didn't handle it politely.\n"
