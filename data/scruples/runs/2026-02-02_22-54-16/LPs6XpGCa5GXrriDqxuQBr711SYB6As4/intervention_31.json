      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling a date to get an Uber after she didn't want to pursue a relationship.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy arranged a date with a girl on OkCupid. He picked her up because she doesn't drive, went to a restaurant, paid the check, and asked when they could go out again. She said she's not looking to date, he asked why she came on the date, she said she likes meeting new people. Then he told her to get an Uber home and left.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to think about social norms and what's considered polite or appropriate here. The guy paid for the date, which is traditional in some contexts, but she made it clear she's not interested in a relationship. After the date, when she said she's not looking to date, he asked why she came. She explained she just likes meeting people. Then he told her to Uber home and left. \n\nIs telling her to take an Uber rude? Well, he had already picked her up, so maybe he expected her to stay or at least have a proper goodbye. But she's not interested, so maybe he just wanted to end the interaction. If she's not going to be his girlfriend, maybe he felt it's best to part ways and not offer to drive her back. But is it polite to just tell her to Uber? Maybe a more considerate approach would be to offer to drive her home even if he's not interested in a relationship. But since she's not into dating, maybe he just wanted to cut the conversation short. \n\nAlso, she may have expected him to drive her home since he picked her up. If he left her stranded, that would be wrong. But she can take an Uber. So is it wrong to not offer a ride? If he's not interested in a relationship, maybe he's justified in not offering further help. But some might see it as abrupt or inconsiderate. \n\nAnother angle: After the date, even if you're not interested, it's polite to at least walk her to her car or offer a ride. But she can't drive, so he had to take her somewhere. If he left her at the restaurant, that's a problem. But he told her to take an Uber, implying he's not going to drive her home. So maybe he's being abrupt. \n\nHowever, considering that she's not looking to date, maybe he's trying to avoid further interaction. So he's not wrong, but maybe just choosing to end the date immediately. \n\nI think the key here is whether the action of telling her to take an Uber is considered rude. If he had picked her up, he might be expected to drop her off, but she's not into dating. So maybe he's within his rights to say \"you can take an Uber\" and leave. But some might argue that since he picked her up, he should be responsible to drop her off regardless of the date's outcome. \n\nThe user says they think the author is not in the wrong. The question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, based on these considerations, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He made it clear he's not interested in a relationship, and after the rejection, he's ending the interaction. Telling her to take an Uber is a way to exit the situation without further commitment. It might be seen as abrupt, but not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
