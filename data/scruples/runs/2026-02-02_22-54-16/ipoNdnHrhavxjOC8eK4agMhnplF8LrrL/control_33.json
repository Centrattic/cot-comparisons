We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband and wife have been married for 20 years. The wife inherited a large sum from her mother, and during her grieving period, she gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. The husband used 40% of that inheritance to buy a house in Colorado without her knowledge. The rest went into their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her because he thought she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving, and he saw a good investment opportunity.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the wife give him the authority to use the inheritance as he did? The post says she gave him legal authority to sort through her mother's affairs. But does that include spending 40% of the inheritance on a new property? Legal authority might cover handling the affairs, like paying debts or closing accounts, but using a portion for a personal investment might be beyond that scope.\n\nAlso, even if she gave him legal authority, there's the aspect of marital trust and communication. In most marriages, major financial decisions are made jointly. Using a spouse's inheritance without their knowledge, even with some authority, could be seen as a breach of trust. The husband's justification is that he was protecting her during her grieving and acting in their best interest, but the secrecy might be problematic. The wife might have different priorities for the inheritance, like saving it or using it differently. The fact that he plans to reveal it later and see her reaction is a step, but the initial secrecy is a red flag.\n\nIn many places, inheritances are considered separate property, even in a marriage. So using it without consent could be legally and ethically questionable. Even if the husband had her permission to handle the affairs, spending a significant portion on a personal investment without her knowledge might not be appropriate. The husband's actions could be seen as self-serving, especially if the wife had a different financial philosophy.\n\nSo, putting this together, the husband probably overstepped. Even with the legal authority, the inheritance is the wife's, and using it without her explicit consent for a major purchase is likely wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
