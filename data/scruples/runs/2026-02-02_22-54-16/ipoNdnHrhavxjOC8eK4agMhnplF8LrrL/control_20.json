We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death and gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. He claims he did it to avoid burdening her during her grieving process and because he saw a good investment opportunity.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Even though the husband was given legal authority, that doesn't necessarily mean he had the right to spend her inheritance without her consent. The inheritance is her money, and while he might have good intentions, using a significant portion for a personal investment without her input is a big deal. \n\nTrust is crucial in a marriage. Withholding such a major financial decision from his wife, especially regarding her own money, could be seen as a breach of trust. The husband's justification is that he wanted to protect her from dealing with financial matters during her grief, but that doesn't absolve him of the responsibility to be transparent. \n\nAlso, the fact that he plans to surprise her with the purchase, even if it's to see her reaction, is a red flag. It shows he didn't involve her in the decision-making process at all. Even if he thought it would benefit them both, making a decision of this magnitude without her input is a problem. \n\nFinancial decisions this large should be mutual, especially when it involves a spouse's inheritance. The husband's actions, regardless of intent, could lead to feelings of betrayal or disrespect. So, ethically, it's questionable. Legally, depending on the jurisdiction, there might be issues about co-ownership or unauthorized spending, but the question is about being in the wrong morally.\n\nIn summary, even with the legal authority, using her inheritance without her knowledge and consent is a violation of trust and partnership in the marriage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
