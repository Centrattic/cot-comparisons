We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife have been married for 20 years. They own a condo together, which has sentimental value. The author wants to buy a new house in Colorado, using 40% of his wife's inheritance, which she received after her mother's death. He acted without her knowledge because she was grieving and wanted him to handle the inheritance. He mentions he has legal authority to manage her mother's affairs, which he used to get the inheritance. The rest of the money went into their joint portfolio.\n\nNow, the key points here are: legal authority, the wife's state of mind during grieving, and the use of her inheritance without her consent. The author claims he had her permission to handle the inheritance, but does that extend to using it for his own investment? Even if he had legal authority, does that mean he has the right to make such a significant financial decision without her input? The wife might not have intended for her inheritance to be used for a new house, especially since she's more conservative. Also, the fact that he's planning to surprise her with this decision is a red flag. Trust and transparency are important in a marriage, and using her money without discussing it could be seen as a breach of that trust.\n\nBut then, the legal authority part might be a defense. If he had power of attorney or similar legal rights, maybe he was within his rights. However, even with legal authority, the ethical aspect is still questionable. The inheritance is her personal asset, and using it without her consent could harm their relationship. The author might argue that he was acting in their best interest, but the wife might see it as him taking advantage of her vulnerable state. There's also the question of joint investments\u2014putting part into their portfolio might seem less problematic, but using a large chunk for a personal purchase without her knowledge crosses a line.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the wife didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving. That's a valid point, but does that justify making a major financial decision without her input? Maybe he should have waited until she was ready to discuss it. The surprise element is risky because if she doesn't like it, he's in a difficult position. The appreciation of the property is a potential upside, but if the wife is upset, the emotional cost could outweigh any financial gain.\n\nIn terms of legal vs. ethical, the author might not be legally wrong if he had the authority, but ethically, it's a gray area. The wife might feel wronged regardless of the legality. So, the answer could depend on whether we're considering legal right or moral right. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which includes both legal and ethical aspects, the author is likely in the wrong because even if he had the legal power, the ethical decision would require transparency and consent from his wife.\n"
