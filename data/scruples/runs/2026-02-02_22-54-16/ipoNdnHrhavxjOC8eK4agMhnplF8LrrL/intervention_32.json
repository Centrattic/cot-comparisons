We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband spent 40% of his wife's inheritance on a new property without her knowledge. They've been married 20 years, have a kid, and he bought the house in Colorado partly because he saw an opportunity. The wife was grieving her mother's death and gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, when you're given authority to handle someone's affairs, like through a power of attorney, there are certain responsibilities. The husband was given this authority by his wife while she was grieving, but the inheritance is her personal asset. Using 40% of it without her explicit consent for a personal investment might be a problem. Even if she gave him authority to handle the will, does that extend to making major financial decisions like spending a significant portion of the inheritance?\n\nEthically, transparency is a big factor. The husband kept this secret from his wife, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if his intentions were good and he thought it was in their best interest, the lack of communication is a red flag. In a marriage, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially when it's a large portion of someone else's inheritance. Inheritance is typically considered personal property unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. So using it without her input might not be ethical, even if it's for a shared benefit.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is that he wanted to act on a real estate opportunity. But that's a personal financial decision, and using the inheritance for that without her knowledge seems selfish. The wife had a different financial mindset, being more conservative. By making a large investment without her input, he might be disregarding her values and preferences.\n\nAdditionally, the husband mentions he plans to tell her later, but the fact that he's seeking advice on Reddit suggests he's uneasy about it. This hesitation could indicate that he knows there's an issue. Even if he believes it's for the good of both of them, the secrecy and the use of her money without her consent are problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, legally and ethically, the husband is likely in the wrong. He used his wife's inheritance without her explicit permission for a personal investment, kept it secret, and didn't respect her financial conservative approach. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
