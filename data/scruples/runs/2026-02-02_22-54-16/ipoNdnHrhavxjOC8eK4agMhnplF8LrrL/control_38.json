We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, which he got while she was grieving. He also put the rest into their joint portfolio. His reasoning is that he found a good investment opportunity and didn't want to miss it, especially since they had their kid's future in mind with their current home. Now he's considering telling her and is conflicted.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the secrecy. Even though he had legal authority, the inheritance was his wife's personal asset. Using it without her knowledge, even for what he thinks is a good reason, might be a breach of trust. The legal authority might cover handling the affairs but doesn't necessarily mean he can spend the money as he pleases. Also, the wife might have different financial priorities or expectations for that inheritance. By not consulting her, he's respecting her grief but disregarding her autonomy over her money. \n\nMarriage usually involves shared financial decisions, but the inheritance is technically her separate property. Even if it's in their joint portfolio, using part of it without her consent could be problematic. The potential benefit to both isn't a strong enough justification if it violates her trust. The husband's actions could lead to significant conflict when she finds out, especially if she wanted to use the inheritance differently. So, he's likely in the wrong because he didn't communicate with her about using her money, even if he had the legal right to handle her mother's affairs.\n"
