We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe man and his wife have been married for 20 years, living in the same condo for 10. They have a kid who's now gone. He's in a good career position to buy a new house. The wife is more conservative with money. She received a large inheritance from her mom, and during her grieving period, he was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. With that authority, he used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado (~$650k) and put the rest into their joint investment portfolio. He did this without her knowledge because she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving. His plan is to check in with her monthly to see her feelings about it. If she likes it, they move in; if not, he might rent or sell it, which he thinks has already appreciated.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The question is A for yes (wrong) or B for no (not wrong).\n\nFirst, legal authority: The wife gave him legal authority to handle the inheritance, which is part of her mother's affairs. So technically, he had the power to manage that money. But did she authorize him to spend it on a new property? The post says he was handling the will's implications, which might involve settling the estate, not using the inheritance for personal purchases. Inheritance is usually personal property, so even if she gave him authority, does that mean he can use it as he sees fit? Maybe not. Legal authority might allow him to manage the assets (like collecting the inheritance check, paying debts related to the estate), but not necessarily to make high-stakes investments without her consent.\n\nAlso, the wife's mindset: She's conservative with money. He's making a big financial decision without her input. Even if he had her permission to handle the estate, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her knowledge could be a breach of trust. Marital assets are typically shared, but inheritance can be considered separate unless it's put into joint accounts. However, he put the rest into the joint portfolio, which might complicate things further.\n\nThe reasoning is that he couldn't walk away from the opportunity once he found out about the inheritance. But that's his own decision-making. Even if she was grieving, using someone else's inheritance (which is their personal money) for a joint purchase without explicit consent seems problematic. The legal authority might not cover personal investments. Also, the fact that he's keeping it secret and plans to spring it on her raises red flags. Transparency in a marriage is crucial, especially with large financial decisions.\n\nSo even if legally he had the authority to handle the estate, morally and ethically, using a significant part of her inheritance without her knowledge and against her financial personality could be wrong. The wife might not have wanted to use her inheritance for a new house, especially one that's a big portion. The surprise aspect, even with a plan to discuss later, might not be the right approach. Marital trust is important, and this could damage it regardless of the legal angle.\n"
