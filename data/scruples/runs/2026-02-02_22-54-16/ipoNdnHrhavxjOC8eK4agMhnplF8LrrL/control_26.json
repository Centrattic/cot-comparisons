We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the wife inherited a large sum after her mother passed away. The husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her about buying the property because he thought she didn't want to deal with financial stuff during her grief. Now he's considering whether to tell her and feels like he might be selfish.\n\nHmm. So, legal authority to handle affairs\u2014does that include spending the inheritance? The key here is understanding the legal scope of the authority he was given. If she gave him legal power of attorney or something similar, maybe he was allowed to manage the estate, but using a significant portion to buy a property without her consent could be an issue. Even if she was grieving, she might have expected transparency. Inheritance is typically considered separate property unless it's a joint account. So using her inheritance without her knowledge is a big deal. Also, the husband's reasoning is that he wanted to act on a financial opportunity, but he didn't discuss it with her, which is a major decision affecting their finances. Even if he thought it was in their best interest, not involving her in the decision might be a breach of trust. The fact that he plans to reveal it later doesn't excuse the secrecy. Marital trust and communication are important here. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he used her inheritance without her knowledge, even if he had legal authority, and made a major financial decision unilaterally.\n"
