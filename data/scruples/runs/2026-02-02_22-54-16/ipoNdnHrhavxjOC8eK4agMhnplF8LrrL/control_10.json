We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person used 40% of their wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado. They had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs because she gave it to them while grieving. But was there a limit to that authority? The wife didn't know the money was being used for this purchase. The husband's reasoning is that he couldn't pass up the investment opportunity and wanted to maybe move there later. He plans to check in with her about it.\n\nHmm. Legal authority might give him the power to manage the inheritance, but does that include spending it on a personal investment without informing her? Inheritances are typically considered separate property, but since it's in a joint portfolio now, maybe there's more to it. Also, the husband used a significant portion without her knowledge. Trust is a big factor here. Even if he had the legal right, withholding such a major financial decision could damage the relationship. The wife might feel disrespected or blindsided. Even if his intentions are good, the action of keeping it a secret seems like a breach of trust. So, I think the answer is A, he's in the wrong because he used her money without her consent, even if he had legal authority. The secrecy and lack of communication are the main issues here.\n"
