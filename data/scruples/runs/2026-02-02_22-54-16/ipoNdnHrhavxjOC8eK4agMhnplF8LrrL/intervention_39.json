We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by secretly spending his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs because she gave him power of attorney during her grieving period. His reasoning was that she didn't want to deal with financial matters at the time, and he wanted to take advantage of a real estate opportunity. He plans to check in with her monthly and adjust based on her reaction.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects. If he had legal authority (like power of attorney) to manage her inheritance, then technically he might not be breaking the law. However, the ethical question is about trust and transparency in the marriage. Even if he had the legal right, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust. Marital assets, especially inheritances, can sometimes be considered separate property, but the way they're managed can vary by jurisdiction. But since the wife gave him authority to handle her mother's affairs, maybe that extends to managing the inheritance as well? It's a bit unclear, but the legal angle might not be the main issue here.\n\nEthically, though, there's a problem. In a marriage, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even if she gave him power of attorney, the inheritance is hers, and using 40% without her knowledge might not align with what she would have wanted. She might have different plans for the inheritance, like saving it, investing it differently, or using it for other purposes. The husband assumed he could make this decision alone, which could cause conflict later. Plus, the sentimental value of their current home and the new property's potential as a rental or for the child adds layers of complexity. The husband's plan to surprise her with the purchase could lead to resentment if she's not on board. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he's thinking about their future, but the ethical dilemma is about respecting his wife's autonomy. Even if the legal authority exists, the lack of communication and her potential feelings of betrayal are significant. The fact that he's planning to reveal it gradually by visiting the property monthly suggests he's aware there might be issues. \n\nSo, legally maybe not in the wrong, but ethically, yes, he acted without her consent on a major financial matter that affects her inheritance. In many relationships, transparency is key, and this decision could erode trust. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he is in the wrong.\n"
