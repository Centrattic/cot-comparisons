We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. The situation involves a married couple with a 20-year-old child who has left the house. The husband was given legal authority by the wife to handle her mother's affairs during her time of grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and the rest went into their joint portfolio.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The wife gave him legal authority to sort through her mother's affairs. If that authority explicitly allowed him to handle the inheritance, maybe even to invest or purchase property, then he might be within his rights. But if the legal authority was more about managing the affairs (like closing accounts, handling funeral expenses, etc.) and not about spending the inheritance, then he might have overstepped.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. Even if it's legal, using someone's inheritance without their knowledge can be seen as a breach of trust. The inheritance is typically considered the wife's personal asset, not joint. By spending 40% without her input, he's making a significant financial decision that affects her. The wife was grieving and might not have been in a position to make such decisions, but she gave him authority, which he used. However, the key point is whether the authority was given for immediate spending on a new house. If she gave him general authority to handle the estate, maybe that's different from authorizing a specific large purchase.\n\nAlso, the husband's plan to surprise her and then decide based on her reaction might be a problem. The surprise element could cause conflict if she feels blindsided. Inheritance can be emotionally charged, and using it without discussing, even if the intention is to benefit both, could be seen as selfish. The wife's conservative mindset suggests she might have wanted to save or use the inheritance differently. The husband's decision might not align with her wishes, even if he thought it was best for both of them.\n\nAnother angle: If the property is in their joint names, then using the inheritance in the joint portfolio is shared. But if it's in his name alone, it's a different story. The fact that he's considering using it as a rental or reselling if she doesn't like it might indicate that he didn't fully consider her feelings. Even though he has a plan for if she doesn't like it, the initial action was unilateral.\n\nPotential consequences: The wife might feel disrespected or that her inheritance was misused. Trust is a big factor in relationships, and financial decisions are sensitive. The husband might be in the wrong if he didn't communicate this major purchase, even with the legal authority. The legal authority is a point in his favor, but not using the inheritance as she might have intended (maybe she wanted to keep it as a lump sum or use it for something else) could be the issue.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning about the opportunity in the market\u2014maybe the timing was crucial, but even so, he should have discussed it with her once the opportunity became serious. The fact that he waited until after she was grieving adds another layer. It's possible she was more vulnerable then, and he took advantage of that to make a decision without her input.\n\nIn summary, while he had legal authority, the ethical consideration is about trust and communication. Even if she gave him the power to handle the affairs, she might not have expected a large personal investment. So the answer could be that he is in the wrong (A) because he made a significant financial decision unilaterally, potentially undermining the trust and not respecting her likely wishes during a vulnerable time.\n"
