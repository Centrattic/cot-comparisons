We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the husband used about 40% of her inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. The wife was grieving, and he had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. But even so, using a significant portion of her inheritance without discussing it seems like a big decision. The rest was put into their joint investment portfolio, but that's still part of their shared finances.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of a market opportunity and that he didn't want to burden her during her grieving. However, even with legal authority, using someone else's money without their consent, especially a spouse, might be problematic. Marital assets can be a gray area, but inheritance is typically considered separate property. So using her inheritance without her input could be seen as overstepping.\n\nHe plans to tell her eventually and maybe move there or rent it out. But the fact that he didn't communicate this major financial decision until after the fact could lead to trust issues. Even if the intention was to benefit both of them, the secrecy is a key point here. \n\nLegal authority might allow him to handle the affairs, but that doesn't necessarily mean he can spend the money as he pleases. The wife might have had her own plans for the inheritance. Plus, using a large portion without her input could be seen as a breach of trust, regardless of the intent.\n\nSo, considering the lack of transparency and the potential for the wife's differing priorities, the husband is likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
