We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new house without her knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death and gave him authority to handle the will. But he used the inheritance money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Did he have the legal authority to use the inheritance? The wife gave him legal authority to sort through her mother's affairs. But inheritance money is typically considered the recipient's personal property. Even if he had power of attorney, using it for a joint purchase without her consent might be problematic. Unless the will specifically allowed that, but there's no mention of that here.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The wife might have intended the inheritance for her own use, maybe for her mother's funeral, debts, or her own future. By using part of it without her input, he's making a decision that affects her financial situation. Even if he thought she was too grief-stricken to handle it, that's not a valid reason to make such a big financial decision without her. Trust is important in a marriage, and this secret decision could damage that trust.\n\nHe also mentions that he plans to surprise her. If she's unhappy, he's prepared to sell or rent it. But the fact that he didn't consult her at all is a big issue. Marriage usually involves shared financial decisions, especially when using large sums of money. Even if the house could benefit them both, the lack of transparency is a problem.\n\nAdditionally, the house in Colorado is a significant investment. The appreciation he's expecting might be uncertain. If the market dips, he could be putting her inheritance at risk without her knowledge. That's a big responsibility he's taking on without her consent.\n\nIn summary, even if he had the legal authority to handle the will, using the inheritance money for joint investments without her knowledge, especially while she was grieving, is ethically wrong. The lack of communication and respect for her autonomy in financial decisions is a key factor here. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
