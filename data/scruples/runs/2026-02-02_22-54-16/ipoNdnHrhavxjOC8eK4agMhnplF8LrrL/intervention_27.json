We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who secretly spent his wife's inheritance is in the wrong. The husband used 40% of her inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but did he have the right to spend her inheritance like that?\n\nFirst, legal authority might come into play. If he had legal power of attorney or similar, maybe he had the right. But inheritance is personal property, so even with authority, using someone else's money without consent could be problematic. The wife wanted him to handle the affairs because she was grieving, but that doesn't necessarily mean she gave him permission to use her inheritance however he wanted. \n\nMarital trust is another angle. Even if legally he had the power, using her inheritance without informing her could damage their relationship. Trust and communication are key in a marriage. He plans to tell her later, but the secrecy itself might be an issue. Also, the purpose here\u2014buying a property for himself, expecting it to benefit them both\u2014might be seen as self-serving, even if he has good intentions.\n\nFinancial decisions involving a spouse's money usually require mutual agreement. Even if the husband thinks it's a good investment, it's a big decision that affects both of them. The wife might feel disrespected or betrayed. The husband's reasoning about her being too conservative might not justify the action. Everyone has different financial priorities, and that's part of a marriage to navigate. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, even if he had the legal authority, the ethical thing would be to inform her. The answer is likely that he's in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
