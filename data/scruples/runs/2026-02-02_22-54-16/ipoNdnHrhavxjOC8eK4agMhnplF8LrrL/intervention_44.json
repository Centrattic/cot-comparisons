We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance.\n\nFirst, the situation: the husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death, and he had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. He bought a house in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. He plans to check her reaction and possibly move there or use it as a rental.\n\nSo, the key points here. The husband had legal authority, but was the inheritance considered their joint property? In many places, inheritance is considered separate property unless it's put into a joint account. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, which might include managing the inheritance, but does that mean he can spend it as he sees fit? \n\nThe wife might have expected the inheritance to be hers alone, even if they are married. Marital property laws vary, but if the inheritance was received by her after marriage and they are in a place where separate property remains separate, then he might have no right to spend that portion without her consent. Even if he had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, using the inherited funds for a joint purchase without her knowledge could be a breach of trust and potentially illegal, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nAlso, the husband didn't consult her after she was grieving, which is a sensitive time. Even if he had the authority, using the money without her input once she's ready could be seen as disrespectful. The fact that he plans to resell or rent it if she doesn't like it shows he's considering his own desires over her wishes, which could be selfish. Trust and communication are crucial in a marriage, and this secret spending might erode that trust.\n\nSo, even if he had the legal authority, morally and ethically, he might be in the wrong for not being transparent and respecting her wishes. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and the nature of inheritance being her separate asset.\n"
