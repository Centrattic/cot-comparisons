We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property.\n\nFirst, the wife was grieving, and the husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. So he had some power here. But using 40% of the inheritance without her knowledge seems like a big deal. Even though he had authority, the inheritance is her money. Legal authority might cover handling the affairs, but spending a large portion on a personal investment without her consent might cross a line. \n\nThe husband mentions he did it because she didn't want to deal with financial stuff while grieving. But that's not an excuse to make such a significant financial decision without her. They're married, so major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even if he planned to tell her later, the fact that he kept it a secret for so long and used her money for his own investment (like a new house) could be wrong.\n\nAlso, the property is in Colorado, which is a personal investment. If the wife didn't agree, he's risking her inheritance without her consent. The husband might have good intentions, but the act of spending someone else's money without their knowledge is ethically questionable. Even if he plans to share the benefits, the initial action was unauthorized. \n\nSo considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he used his wife's inheritance without her knowledge, which is a breach of trust and possibly violates their shared financial responsibilities as a married couple.\n"
