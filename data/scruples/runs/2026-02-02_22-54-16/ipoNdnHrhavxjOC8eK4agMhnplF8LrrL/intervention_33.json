We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. The situation involves a married couple with a 20-year marriage, and the wife recently inherited money from her mother's passing. The husband, having legal authority to handle her mother's affairs during her grieving period, used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint investment portfolio.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The husband was given legal authority by his wife to handle her mother's affairs, which might include managing the inheritance. If he had the legal right to use the funds, then from a legal standpoint, he might not be in the wrong. However, ethics can be more subjective. The wife didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving, so she gave him the authority. But using a significant portion of her inheritance without her consent, even if she allowed him to handle the affairs, could be seen as a breach of trust. Inheritance is a personal matter, and while the husband might have the legal power, the ethical issue is about transparency and mutual decision-making in a marriage.\n\nAnother angle is the husband's intent. He mentions that he's looking to buy a new house because of his career and the empty nest situation. The new property might benefit both of them, but the decision was made unilaterally. Even if the wife later approves, the secret purchase and lack of communication could lead to resentment. The husband's plan to check in on her feelings is a step towards resolution, but the act itself was done behind her back, which is a problem in a trusting relationship.\n\nFinancial responsibilities in marriage often require joint decisions, especially when it comes to large investments and using significant funds. The husband might have thought he was acting in their best interest, but withholding such a big decision could be selfish, even if he believed the wife was in a vulnerable state. The key here is the absence of discussion. While the wife was grieving, she might have given authority for immediate tasks related to the will and estate, not for investing a large portion of her inheritance into a real estate purchase. The husband's assumption that she would be okay with this might be incorrect, and the surprise could be seen as a violation of her autonomy and the trust they've built over 20 years.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might not be legally in the wrong, but ethically, especially in a marriage where joint decisions are typically expected, he could be at fault for not being transparent. The answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because even with legal authority, the ethical obligation to communicate and make joint financial decisions is important. Secretly spending such a large amount without her input, despite her conservative nature, shows a lack of respect for her financial values and possible future wishes regarding the inheritance.\n"
