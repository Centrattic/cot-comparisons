We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is that a husband used his wife's inheritance without her knowledge to buy a new property and invest the rest.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The husband had legal authority to handle his wife's affairs after her mother's death, as she gave him that power while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado and invested the rest. The wife didn't want to deal with financial matters during her grieving period, so she gave him the authority. The husband's reasoning is that he saw an opportunity in the market and couldn't pass it up. He plans to visit the property monthly to gauge her reaction and possibly move in if she's okay with it, or otherwise rent it out or sell it.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and legal aspects. Legally, if the wife gave him the authority, then technically he might have the right to make those decisions. But the main issue is the lack of communication. Even though she gave him the power, she might not have anticipated the extent of the spending. The husband didn't inform her about using the inheritance for real estate; he just acted on his own. That lack of transparency is a problem. The wife might feel betrayed, even if he had the legal authority. Sentimentally, the couple has been married for 20 years, and they have a shared history in their current home. The husband's decision to buy a new property without her input could undermine their partnership in managing finances. Also, using her inheritance for their joint investment might not align with her wishes if she later discovers it. The husband's plan to surprise her and see her reaction is risky because it could lead to conflict. Even if the investment is sound, the breach of trust could damage their relationship more than the financial implications.\n\nSo, even if legally he had the authority, ethically, he's in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife about such a significant decision. Major financial decisions, especially involving a spouse's inheritance, should be discussed and agreed upon. The surprise tactic, while well-intentioned, shows a lack of respect for her autonomy in financial matters. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
