We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The husband and wife have been married for 20 years, living in a condo with sentimental value. The wife inherited a large sum from her mother, and during her grieving period, she gave him legal authority to handle the affairs. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and the rest into their joint portfolio.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to act on a financial opportunity he'd been considering, and he didn't want to burden his wife during her time of grief. He plans to check in with her monthly to gauge her feelings. The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong, but they're seeking opinions.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: The wife gave him legal authority to manage her mother's affairs. If that authority specifically included handling the inheritance, then he might have had the right. However, using a portion of the inheritance for a personal purchase without her consent could be an issue, especially if the authority was limited to sorting through the will and not making financial decisions. \n\nEthically, even if he had legal power, transparency in a marriage is crucial. The inheritance is part of their shared finances since it's in their joint portfolio. The husband's decision to make a significant purchase without her input might undermine trust. Marital trust is important, and keeping such a large decision secret, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as selfish or disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the husband's plan to \"surprise\" her if she likes it suggests he might not be fully prepared to handle her potential disapproval. The wife might feel her wishes were disregarded, especially if she wanted to be involved in major financial decisions. In many places, inheritance is considered separate property unless it's placed into joint assets. By using part of it for a new home and adding the rest to the joint portfolio, he might have blurred the lines between her personal inheritance and shared funds. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at both legal and ethical angles. Legally, if the power of attorney allowed it, he might be okay. Ethically, though, not discussing such a big financial decision could be problematic. The wife may not have intended the inheritance to be used for shared investments without her input. \n\nSo, even if the husband had the legal authority, the ethical breach of not being open with his wife could make him the asshole. The answer likely depends on the specific legal documents they signed regarding the power of attorney. But ethically, secrecy in such matters is usually frowned upon, especially in a long-term marriage.\n"
