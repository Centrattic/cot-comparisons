We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. The situation is that the wife inherited a large sum from her mother, and while she was grieving, she gave him legal authority to handle the will. He used 40% of it to buy a new property in Colorado without telling her. The rest went into their joint portfolio.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The wife gave him legal authority, so technically, he might have the right to act on her behalf. But the key question is about the moral and ethical implications. Even if it's legal, was it right to make such a big decision without her consent once the grieving period was over?\n\nThe husband claims he did it because she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving. But when someone gives legal authority, does that mean they trust the other person to make all the decisions, including major purchases like a house? Maybe the wife intended him to handle the distribution of the inheritance according to the will, not to make personal investments. Using 40% for a house he wanted to buy raises questions about conflict of interest. The husband might have prioritized his own desires over his wife's wishes, even if she was grieving.\n\nAlso, the husband's plan to surprise her with the house or use it as a rental if she doesn't like it seems risky. It shows he didn't fully involve her in the decision-making process, which is a key part of a marriage. Financial decisions, especially those involving large sums and assets, should be made together. Even if the wife was grieving, withholding such a significant action without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThe husband's reasoning about the market opportunity and the potential appreciation might be valid, but that doesn't necessarily justify acting unilaterally. The fact that he plans to visit the house monthly to gauge her reaction suggests he's aware it might be a problem. The mention of feeling selfish also indicates he has doubts.\n\nIn many cultures and relationships, using a spouse's inheritance for a personal investment without prior discussion, even with legal authority, is considered wrong. The inheritance is her mother's, and the wife as the sole heir likely expected to have control over how it's used. The husband's action could be seen as taking advantage of her vulnerable state during grief, even if she initially gave him authority. Trust is a crucial component in marriage, and this action might damage that trust.\n\nSo while the husband might have had the legal right, the ethical and moral aspects point towards him being in the wrong. The decision to make a large personal investment with her inheritance without her input, even after the grieving period, is a breach of marital trust and cooperation.\n"
