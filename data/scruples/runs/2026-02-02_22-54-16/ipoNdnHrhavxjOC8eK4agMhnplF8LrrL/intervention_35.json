We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a house without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, the author had legal authority from his wife to handle her mother's affairs. The wife gave him power of attorney while she was grieving, which he used to access the inheritance. But he used 40% of it for a new property in Colorado, which he saw as an investment opportunity. He didn't tell her because she was grieving and didn't want her to deal with financial matters at that time.\n\nNow, the key points here. Legally, he had the authority, but the ethical question is about the use of the inheritance. Inheritances are typically considered separate property unless specified otherwise. Even though he had legal power, the inheritance was his wife's personal asset. By using it without her consent, even if she gave him the authority, he made a major financial decision that affects her assets. \n\nEven if his intention was good, like planning for their future or seeing an investment opportunity, the fact that he didn't consult her after the initial grieving period might be a problem. Trust is a big part of a marriage. Making a large purchase without discussing it with the spouse, even if legally permissible, can be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the wife might not have wanted to deal with it at the time, but she has a right to know and be involved in decisions regarding her inheritance. The husband's plan to wait and see her reaction later might come off as manipulative. It's possible she would have preferred to make that decision herself, even if she was grieving. \n\nSo, while legally he might not be in the wrong, ethically and in terms of marital trust, he probably did something wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
