We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband and wife have been married for 20 years. The wife received an inheritance, and she gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of that inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado, putting the rest into their joint portfolio. He did this without her knowledge, reasoning that she didn't want to deal with financial stuff during her grief. His plan is to check in with her monthly about the new property.\n\nNow, the key points here. The wife gave him legal authority to handle the affairs. So, does that mean he had permission to use the inheritance? The question is whether using 40% for a new house is within that authority. Inheritances are typically considered separate property unless they're considered marital property in the state they're in. But the wife gave him legal power of attorney, which might extend to managing her assets, but using them for a joint decision like buying a home might be different.\n\nThe husband mentions they want to move there eventually. But buying a house is a big decision that affects both partners. Even if she gave him authority, using her inheritance without her input could be problematic. The fact that he didn't consult her beyond checking in later suggests a lack of transparency. Also, the inheritance is her money, so using 40% of it without her consent could be seen as overstepping, even if she gave him power of attorney for the will and affairs. The power of attorney likely allows him to manage her mother's estate, but not necessarily her own inheritance unless specified. \n\nIn many places, inheritance is considered separate, especially if it's given directly to the wife. So, using that without her agreement might be legally questionable. Ethically, even if he had authority, the use of her money for a major purchase without her knowledge is a breach of trust. The husband's justification is that she didn't want to deal with it while grieving, but that's not a valid reason to make such a significant financial decision on her behalf. She might have wanted to use the inheritance differently. \n\nThe husband's plan to surprise her could lead to conflict if she's not on board. Even if it's a good investment, the decision was made unilaterally. The fact that he's worried about telling her suggests he knows it's a risky move. So, while he might have had legal authority to handle some aspects, using her inheritance for a personal financial decision without her input is likely wrong, both ethically and possibly legally. Therefore, the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
