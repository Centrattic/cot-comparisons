We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. The scenario is that the wife got a large inheritance, and the husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint investment portfolio. The husband wanted to buy a house there because he's in a good career position and the kid is gone, but the wife is more conservative and didn't want any financial issues during her grieving period. He plans to visit the property monthly and see if she likes it, possibly moving in or using it as a rental.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he's in the wrong. Let me break down the key points. Legal authority: he was given legal authority to manage her mother's affairs, which includes the inheritance. But does that legal authority extend to using the inheritance for personal financial decisions like buying a house? The wife specified that he should handle the implications of the will, so maybe she meant managing the estate, like closing accounts, distributing funds, etc. But spending 40% on a house without her knowledge\u2014does that fall under her authority? That's a bit unclear. Legal authority might not mean he can spend it however he wants unless the power of attorney specifically allows for such investments.\n\nThen there's the issue of the joint investment portfolio. If the rest was put into their joint account, he's mixing inherited funds with marital assets. Depending on their jurisdiction, inheritance might be considered separate property, not marital. So by putting it into a joint portfolio, he could be commingling assets. If he then uses part of it for a personal purchase, that might be problematic. Even if the wife is okay with it later, doing it without her consent could be an issue.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to avoid burdening her during her grieving time and he saw a good investment opportunity. But the wife might feel betrayed if she finds out he used her inheritance without discussing it with her. Trust is a big factor in marriages, and financial decisions are usually a joint matter. Even if he had legal authority, the ethical aspect is about transparency and mutual agreement. The wife might not have agreed to the use of her inheritance for this purpose. Plus, the house in Colorado is for their own use or as a rental, so it's a family decision that he made unilaterally.\n\nThe plan to visit monthly and see her reaction is a bit of a gamble. If she's angry because they didn't discuss it, the surprise could backfire. Also, the appreciation of the property is a risk if the market tanks, which could be a financial burden. Even if he's confident, the wife might not share that confidence, especially since her financial mindset is more conservative.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects: Legally, if the power of attorney didn't allow for such a purchase, he's overstepped. Ethically, even if he had the legal authority, spending a significant portion of a spouse's inheritance without their consent is likely a breach of trust. In most relationships, major financial decisions require mutual agreement. The husband took a big step without involving her, which could be seen as selfish, especially if the wife values the money more as her inheritance and might have wanted to use it differently.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong, because he used the inheritance without her knowledge and possibly against her wishes, even if he thought he had the authority. The ethical responsibility in a marriage is to communicate and make joint decisions about such matters.\n"
