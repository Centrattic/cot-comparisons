We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. Here's the situation: They've been married 20 years, living in the same condo with sentimental value. The husband got a career boost and thinks buying a new house is possible. The wife is more conservative and didn't want to deal with financial matters while grieving after her mother's death. He was given legal authority to handle her affairs, so he used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. He wants to surprise her but is worried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If he had legal authority to manage her affairs, then using the inheritance under that power might be okay. But how was the authority granted? It says she gave him legal authority to sort through her mother's affairs, but does that include spending the inheritance? Legal authority might mean handling the estate, like closing accounts or dealing with property, but not necessarily making financial decisions for her personal assets. Inheritance is usually considered separate property unless they have a specific agreement otherwise. Even if it's joint, using a portion without her knowing could be an issue.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Marital trust is a big factor here. Even if it's legal, using her money without her knowledge breaches trust. The wife was grieving, which might be seen as taking advantage of her vulnerable state. The husband might have thought he was acting in her best interest, but secrecy can lead to resentment. The plan to surprise her might not account for her potential anger or the emotional impact of her mother's inheritance being spent without her consent.\n\nAlso, the purpose of the inheritance. The wife's mother might have intended it for her specifically, especially since she's the only child. Using part of it for a joint investment could go against that intent. The husband's reasoning about the market opportunity is understandable, but financial decisions involving such a large sum should be mutual, especially in a long-term marriage. The fact that the property is in Colorado and he plans to use it as a rental or sell it suggests it's a personal investment, not necessarily a joint one.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Even with legal authority, there's a difference between handling affairs and making unilateral financial decisions. The key here is whether the husband acted within the scope of the authority given. If the authority was only for administrative tasks, then using the money for a house purchase might be overstepping. Additionally, the husband's intention to surprise her might be good, but the lack of communication is a red flag. Trust is crucial in marriages, and this action could damage it. The wife might feel her autonomy over her inheritance was violated, regardless of the husband's reasoning. So while the husband might not be legally in the wrong, ethically and emotionally, he probably is. The answer should be A.\n"
