We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. The key points here are the legal authority given by the wife during her grieving period, the use of 40% of the inheritance for a Colorado property, and the rest into their joint portfolio. \n\nFirst, the wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, which might include managing the inheritance. But did she explicitly authorize him to spend it on a new home? The post says he was handling the will's implications and had authority to sort through her mother's affairs. However, using a significant portion of the inheritance without her explicit consent could be an issue. Even if she was grieving, giving someone legal authority to manage affairs doesn't necessarily mean giving them carte blanche to make major financial decisions like purchasing a property.\n\nThen there's the aspect of marital trust and transparency. Even if he had the legal right, the fact that he didn't disclose the purchase to his wife raises questions. The wife might expect that major financial decisions are discussed and agreed upon, especially when it involves her inheritance. The husband's reasoning is that he didn't want to burden her during her grieving, but that's a risky justification. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and keeping such a significant transaction secret, even with good intentions, could lead to betrayal feelings.\n\nAlso, the husband's plan to let the wife discover it by visiting monthly seems like an avoidance strategy. Instead of being honest upfront, he's waiting to see her reaction, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if the investment could benefit them, the method of handling it without her input is problematic. \n\nThe fact that he used his own career timing and financial freedom to make the purchase might not align with the wife's conservative mindset. The wife might have different plans for the inheritance, which he didn't consider. The key issue here is consent and communication. Even if legally he had the authority, ethically, he should have discussed the use of her inheritance with her before proceeding. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband did act unilaterally on a significant financial decision that affects his wife's inheritance without her knowledge. That's likely to be seen as wrong, both ethically and possibly legally if the authority didn't cover such expenditures. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
