We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and invested the rest. He had legal authority from her to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He did this without her knowledge, thinking she didn't want to deal with financial stuff during that time.\n\nSo, legal authority is important here. He was given the legal right to manage the inheritance, so maybe that's a mitigating factor. But using a significant portion without her knowledge might be an issue, even if she gave him authority. Inheritance is typically considered separate property, right? Unless they're in a community property state, but the post doesn't specify the location. However, since they live in a condo and he's talking about buying a new house, maybe it's in a non-community property state where inheritance is separate.\n\nBut even if he had legal authority, using someone else's money without their consent could be problematic. Even if she gave him authority to handle the affairs, using the inheritance for a personal investment (like a new house) might not be what she intended. She might have wanted to keep the inheritance separate. Also, the fact that he's using it to buy a property that he plans to use or rent out could be seen as misusing her funds.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he couldn't pass up the opportunity, but he should have considered her wishes more. Even though she was grieving, she might have expected him to wait until she recovered to discuss the inheritance. His plan to surprise her could backfire if she's upset about the use of her money. Financial decisions of this magnitude usually require mutual agreement, especially when it's her separate funds.\n\nSo, even with legal authority, the ethical aspect is questionable. He may have overstepped by making such a large financial decision without consulting her, even if she was grieving. The sentiment of the post is that he's trying to do what's best, but the action of secretly using her inheritance is likely wrong, both ethically and possibly legally depending on the jurisdiction.\n"
