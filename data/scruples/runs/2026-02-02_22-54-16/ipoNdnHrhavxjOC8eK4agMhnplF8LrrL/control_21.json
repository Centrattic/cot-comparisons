We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person in question used their wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. They had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but the question is whether they were right to spend the inheritance. \n\nFirst, inheritance typically belongs to the heir, so the wife's inheritance is her personal asset. Even though they were given authority to manage the will, that doesn't necessarily mean they can spend the money as they please, especially a large portion like 40%. The key here is whether the authority given was for distributing the inheritance or for other tasks like sorting affairs.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that the wife didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grief, so he took the initiative. However, making a major financial decision like purchasing a property without discussing it with the spouse is a big deal. In many marriages, even with separate assets, major decisions should be mutual. The husband might have thought he was helping by investing the money, but the wife might feel he violated her trust and autonomy.\n\nAlso, the fact that the condo has sentimental value to the wife and he didn't consult her about using her inheritance for a new property could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the new property is a good investment, the lack of transparency is a problem. The husband plans to surprise her, but that approach doesn't account for her potential distress or disagreement. \n\nIn terms of legal right, if the authority was for handling the will's implications, maybe that includes arranging the estate, but spending a significant portion on a joint asset without her input might be beyond the scope. Legally, the heir can decide how to use their inheritance, so the husband used her money without her consent. \n\nEthically, even if the outcome is positive, the method is questionable. Trust and communication are crucial in a marriage, and keeping such a secret could lead to serious consequences like mistrust or conflict. The husband's plan to check her reaction monthly is a red flag because it's reactive rather than proactive. He should have discussed it first.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he used his wife's personal inheritance without her consent, despite having the authority for estate management, and made a major financial decision unilaterally, which breaches trust and financial autonomy.\n"
