We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did something wrong by secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, they've been married for 20 years and live in a condo with sentimental value. The author wants to buy a new house, and his wife is more conservative with money. The wife inherited money from her mother, and during her grieving period, she gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. The author used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint account. He did this without telling her because he thought she didn't want to deal with financial stuff while grieving. Now he's considering whether to tell her and is seeking opinions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Legal authority given by the wife to handle her mother's affairs. 2) The use of her inheritance without her knowledge. 3) The reason being that she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grief. 4) The author's plan to check if she approves later.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the wife gave him legal authority, maybe a power of attorney, then he might have the right to manage her affairs. But the inheritance is hers, so even with authority, using 40% of it for a house purchase without her consent could be an issue. The fact that it's a joint investment in the portfolio might complicate things. Legally, he might have the power to manage her finances, but ethically, using the inheritance without her knowledge could be considered a breach of trust, especially since it's a significant portion.\n\nEthically, even if he had the legal right, acting without transparency is a problem. Marriages require trust and communication. The author made a major financial decision alone, which could undermine the wife's autonomy and trust in the relationship. The argument that she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grief might be a reason, but it's not an excuse to bypass consent. Inheritance is a personal matter, and using it without her knowledge, even with her authority over other affairs, might not be appropriate.\n\nAnother angle: If the legal authority included managing her funds, then perhaps it's within his rights. But using a significant portion for a personal investment (even if it's for both) without her input could be a mistake. The wife might have had different intentions for the inheritance, like using it for her own purposes or saving it. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, regardless of his good intentions.\n\nAlso, the author plans to surprise her with the property, which is a red flag. Even if he thinks it's for their benefit, the lack of transparency and the potential for her to be upset is a risk. The fact that he's now considering telling her suggests he knows he might be in the wrong. The sinking feeling he mentions indicates his own moral conflict.\n\nIn summary, while there might be some legal justification, ethically, the author acted without transparency and possibly violated his wife's trust. The inheritance is hers, and major decisions about its use should involve her. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing, like the legal authority covering the use of the inheritance.\n"
