We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he used his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs during her grieving period. The author used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and the rest into their joint portfolio. He claims he did this without her knowledge because she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving, and he saw a good opportunity. His plan is to check in monthly to see how she feels about it.\n\nNow, the key points here are: legal authority, the wife's state of grief, and the use of her inheritance without her consent. Even though he had legal authority, does that mean he had the right to spend her inheritance? Legal authority might cover handling the affairs, like paying debts or closing accounts, but using the inheritance for personal investment could be a different matter. Inheritances are typically considered separate property unless the spouse is named as a beneficiary. If the inheritance was meant for the wife, using it without her permission could be an issue, even if she gave him authority for other tasks.\n\nAlso, the fact that he used it for a joint investment might not change the fact that it's her money. Even if it's a joint portfolio, she might not have wanted him to spend her inheritance without her input. The surprise factor might be a problem because she might feel disrespected or betrayed. Marital trust is important here. Even if the legal stuff allows it, the ethical aspect is questionable.\n\nHe also mentions selling the house if she doesn't like it. If the market is good and he's planning to sell, that could mean he's using her money to make a profit without her knowledge. That's risky and might not be fair. The author's reasoning is that the move could benefit both, but without her consent, it's a big decision affecting their finances. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, a spouse might not automatically have the right to spend the other's inheritance without explicit permission. Even with authority to handle the affairs, using the funds for personal or joint investments could be a breach of trust. The wife's conservative mindset versus his more aggressive financial approach is a conflict of values. By making the decision unilaterally, he's not respecting her financial autonomy, which is a key part of a marriage.\n\nSo, even if legally he had the authority, ethically and morally, he's in the wrong by not including her in such a significant decision. The surprise could lead to a major conflict. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
