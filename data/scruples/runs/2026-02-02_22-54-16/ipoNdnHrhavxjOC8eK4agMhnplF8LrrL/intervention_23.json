We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. The post says they've been married 20 years, living in a condo for 10. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs during her grieving period. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest in their joint investment portfolio. He justified it by saying he couldn't pass up the opportunity and that the wife didn't want to deal with finances while grieving. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the wife gave him legal authority, maybe through power of attorney or similar, then he might have the right to manage her affairs. But inheritance is typically the recipient's personal property. So, using 40% without her consent could be an issue. Even if she gave him authority, that might be for handling the estate, not for making personal investments. The key here is whether the authority included the right to spend the inheritance on real estate purchases for personal use.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The wife was grieving, which could be seen as a vulnerable time. Even if she didn't want to deal with financial issues, does that mean she implicitly approves of all decisions? The author didn't consult her about the purchase, which is a significant financial decision. Trust and communication are crucial in a marriage. Keeping such a big purchase a secret might breach that trust, regardless of legal permission.\n\nAlso, the author's plan to check if the wife likes it and then maybe use it as a rental if she doesn't. That seems like a contingency plan but doesn't address the initial secrecy. The wife might feel her inheritance was used without her input, which could lead to resentment. Inheriting a large sum is a big deal, and using it for a home that she didn't agree on might not align with her financial goals, especially since she's more conservative. \n\nEven if the author had the legal authority to handle the estate, the inheritance itself is her money. Using it for personal gain without full disclosure and mutual agreement is ethically questionable. The line between managing the estate and using the funds for personal use might be crossed here. The fact that he used part of it for a property he wants to move into, which he terms as \"our\" benefit, but the wife wasn't involved in the decision-making process, is a problem. \n\nThe sentiment about the current condo is mentioned, but the issue here is the inheritance. The author might feel that the new property is for both, but the wife's reaction could be different. The main point is whether he had the right to make such a decision unilaterally. While the authority was given to manage the mother's affairs, the actual use of the inheritance isn't clear. If the will's implications required spending the money, maybe, but otherwise, it's her inheritance. \n\nSo, legally, he might have a point if the authority allowed it, but ethically, he's wrong because he didn't communicate with her, which is essential in a marriage for major financial decisions. The secrecy and lack of transparency could lead to bigger issues, even if the initial action was within the scope of the legal power. The wife might not have intended for the inheritance to be used for a new home unless it was specified in the will. If he spent it on a property that wasn't for the estate, that's using her money without her consent. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because of the ethical breach of not informing her and using her inheritance without mutual agreement.\n"
