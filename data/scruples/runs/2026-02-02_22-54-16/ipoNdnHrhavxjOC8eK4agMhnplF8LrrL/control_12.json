We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife have been married for 20 years. They live in a condo with sentimental value. The wife inherited money from her mother, which she gave him legal authority to handle while she was grieving. He used 40% of that inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado, put the rest into their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her about the purchase yet, planning to visit and see her reaction.\n\nNow, the key points here. The wife gave him legal authority to sort through her mother's affairs. Does that mean she authorized him to spend the inheritance? Well, legal authority might cover handling the will and affairs, but using a portion for a new property might be beyond that. The husband says she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grieving, but using inheritance money without her knowledge is a big deal. \n\nInheritance is often considered separate property, even if it's given to the spouse. So using 40% of it without her consent might be an issue. Even if he had legal authority to handle the affairs, spending the inheritance on a joint venture like a new house or investment could be a problem. The wife might have different plans for her inheritance. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he's acting in both their interests, but that's assuming he knows her wishes, which he doesn't. The fact that he didn't disclose it until possibly later shows a lack of transparency. Even if the investment is good, the principle here is about consent and trust. Marital assets are usually joint, but inheritance is separate. Mixing them without consent could be a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, using the inheritance to buy a property that he might use as a rental or sell later\u2014those decisions should involve her. The wife might not want that property to be used that way. The husband's actions could lead to conflict down the line. Even if he had a good reason, the secrecy is problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband didn't get his wife's consent to use her inheritance, which is a significant financial decision. Even if he had legal authority to handle the affairs, the intent to use the inheritance in this way might not have been covered. The wrong here is not about the legality of the authority but about the ethical decision to spend her money without her knowledge. Therefore, the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
