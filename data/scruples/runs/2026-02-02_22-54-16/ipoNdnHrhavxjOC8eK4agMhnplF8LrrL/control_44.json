We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key points: The wife gave the husband legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her about the purchase yet, planning to let her see it first.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects: Since he had legal authority, maybe he had the right to manage the inheritance. But inheritance is typically the recipient's personal asset unless specified otherwise. Even if she gave him authority, using a portion for a personal investment might be questionable unless there was an agreement.\n\nEthically, even if legal, transparency is important in a marriage. The husband decided without her input, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The wife might not agree with how the inheritance is being used, especially for a new home when they already have a condo with sentimental value.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning: he wanted to take advantage of the market opportunity. But using inherited money without her knowledge might prioritize his goals over hers. The wife might prefer to keep the inheritance separate or use it differently.\n\nSo, legally, maybe he had the authority, but ethically, the secrecy and lack of communication are problematic. The fact that he's planning to surprise her shows he's aware that she might not approve, which points to potential wrongdoing in not being honest from the start.\n"
