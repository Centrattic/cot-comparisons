We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post did something wrong by secretly using their wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points: The husband and wife have been married 20 years. The wife inherited money from her mother. The husband was given authority to handle the affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her, but his reasoning is that she didn't want to deal with financial matters while grieving. He wants to see her reaction before revealing it.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects: The wife gave him legal authority. So, he had the legal right to manage her affairs. But the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing, not just legality. Even if he had the legal authority, using the funds without her knowledge for a personal investment (a house he wanted) might be an issue. The inheritance is her money, and even with authority, using a portion for a purchase that's a significant financial decision without her input could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust and communication in a marriage. Marital finances are usually a shared responsibility. Even if the wife was grieving, the husband's decision to make a large investment without her knowledge might be seen as a breach of trust, especially since it's a joint investment portfolio. Also, the house is in Colorado, and the husband's plan to use it as a rental or sell it shows that it's a financial decision that affects both of them. Not involving the wife in this could be seen as selfish, as he mentions feeling.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to avoid burdening her during her grief, but in a marriage, major financial decisions usually require mutual consent. The fact that he used 40% of the inheritance for a purchase he wanted, even with legal authority, might be ethically questionable. The wife might not appreciate the decision once she's ready to discuss it, leading to potential conflict.\n\nSo, while the husband may have had the legal authority, the ethical standpoint is about transparency and mutual decision-making in a marriage. The author is in the wrong because he made a significant financial decision without his wife's knowledge, despite being married for 20 years and the inheritance being her money. Even with the best intentions, the action could be seen as a breach of trust and lack of communication."
