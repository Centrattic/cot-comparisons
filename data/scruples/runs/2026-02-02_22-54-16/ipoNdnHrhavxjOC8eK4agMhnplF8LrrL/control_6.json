We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The wife inherited money from her mother, and the husband, having legal authority to handle her affairs during her grieving period, used 40% of that inheritance to buy a house in Colorado. He did this without telling her, planning to surprise her and see her reaction. The rest went into their joint investment portfolio.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: He had legal authority, so maybe he wasn't breaking the law. But ethically, did he overstep? The wife was grieving and asked him to handle the affairs, but using a significant portion of the inheritance without her knowledge might be a breach of trust. Inheritances are often considered personal, even in a marriage. Even though it's joint property, using someone else's money for a personal investment without their consent is a big deal.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of the market and planned to use the house for their future. But the wife might feel disrespected or manipulated. The fact that he's trying to present it as a positive surprise doesn't change the fact that he made a major financial decision without her input, which is a cornerstone of a healthy relationship. \n\nFinancial decisions, especially large ones involving someone else's money, should be discussed openly. Even if the wife was grieving, once she's ready, she should have been involved. The husband's action could be seen as selfish, prioritizing his own plans over her wishes and potentially her financial autonomy.\n\nSo, ethically and in terms of relationship trust, the husband is likely in the wrong. Even if legally he had the authority, the lack of communication and the significant use of her inheritance without her consent is problematic.\n"
