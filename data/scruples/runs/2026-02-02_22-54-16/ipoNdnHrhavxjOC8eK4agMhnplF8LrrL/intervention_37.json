We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. The situation: they've been married 20 years, have a condo with sentimental value. The wife got an inheritance, and during her grieving period, she gave the author legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. The author used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. The reasoning was that the wife didn't want to deal with financial matters while grieving, and the author saw a good opportunity.\n\nHmm. The key points here are legal authority and the wife's intentions. If the wife gave explicit legal authority to handle the affairs, maybe including financial decisions, then the author might have the power to do so. But using 40% for a personal investment without discussing it with her raises questions. Even if she was grieving, once she's recovered, she might expect to have a say in how the inheritance is used. The author's plan to check in monthly might be a way to gauge her reaction, but secrecy involved here could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the new property could be for the kid or as a rental. But the wife might have had different plans for the inheritance. Even if it's a joint investment, using a significant portion without full disclosure could be seen as overstepping, especially since the wife is known to be conservative with finances. The author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, lack transparency and mutual decision-making, which are important in a marriage. The fact that the author is conflicted and considering telling her now suggests guilt, which might indicate they think they did wrong. \n\nSo, even if legally allowed, the ethical aspect is about respecting the spouse's wishes and sharing major financial decisions. Inheritance is typically considered separate property unless specified otherwise in a will. But if the wife gave authority to handle the affairs, maybe she intended for him to manage the money. However, using 40% for a new home without her consent might not be the best approach. The author's action might have been within legal bounds, but ethically, it's a gray area. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and the potential misunderstanding of the authority given.\n"
