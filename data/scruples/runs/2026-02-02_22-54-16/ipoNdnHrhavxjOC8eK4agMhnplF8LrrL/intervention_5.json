We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the husband is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the situation: The husband and wife have been married 20 years. They live in a condo with sentimental value. The wife inherited money from her mother, and the husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado, putting the rest in their joint investments. Now he's considering telling her or trying to get her to approve.\n\nSo, key points here. The wife gave him legal authority, but did she give him the authority to spend the inheritance? Just because she let him handle her mother's affairs doesn't necessarily mean he could spend the money. Legal authority might be more about managing the estate (like paying debts, distributing assets as per the will) rather than making personal investments. \n\nInheritance is often considered separate property, especially if it's given to one spouse directly. So using it without consent might be an issue. Even if they're married, using someone else's separate assets without their input could be problematic. The husband says he did it because she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grieving, but that's not a substitute for consent. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning: he wanted to invest in Colorado, and he couldn't walk away from the opportunity. But the wife might have different views on how to use her inheritance. The fact that he plans to visit the property monthly to see her reaction suggests he's aware of the potential conflict. \n\nMarriage doesn't automatically mean joint control over all funds. Each spouse has their own separate assets. If the inheritance was meant for her, using it without her knowledge, even with legal authority, could be a breach of trust. The husband might have overstepped by making a significant financial decision without discussing it, even if it was for the couple's benefit. \n\nThe husband's justification is that he thought it would benefit both of them. But that's not valid unless the spouse agrees. The fact that he's now considering telling her shows he's aware of the ethical dilemma. \n\nSo, even though he had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, using the inheritance without her consent is likely wrong. The inheritance is her separate property, and he shouldn't have used it for joint investments or a new property without her explicit permission. The answer is A.\n"
