We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband did something wrong by secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the setup: they've been married 20 years, living in a condo with sentimental value. The husband wants to buy a new house in Colorado. The wife is more conservative and was grieving her mother's death when he took the inheritance, which she gave him legal authority to handle during her grief.\n\nHe used 40% of the inheritance for the new property and put the rest into their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her because she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving. His plan is to check in monthly and see if she's okay with moving there or if he should rent it out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: legal authority to manage the inheritance, but did he overstep by using a portion for his own plans? The inheritance is her money, even if he had authority to handle it, using a portion without her consent might be an issue. \n\nEven though she gave him legal power, that doesn't necessarily mean he can use the money for his purposes without her approval. The inheritance is hers, and using it without her knowledge, especially for a new home that might not align with her wishes, could be seen as violating trust. Also, the fact that he plans to use it as a rental or sell it if she doesn't like the idea means he's made a decision that affects her assets.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's reasoning about the opportunity in Colorado and his career might be his justification, but the wife's financial preferences and the fact that the money is hers are important. The surprise aspect could lead to conflict, especially if she's against the decision. Trust in a marriage is built on transparency, so keeping this a secret might be the main issue.\n\nSo, even if he had the legal power, using her money without her consent for a major purchase is likely wrong. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
