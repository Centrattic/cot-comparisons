We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The husband had legal authority to handle his wife's mother's affairs, including the inheritance. He used 40% of it to buy a house in Colorado and the rest into their joint portfolio. He did this without telling her because she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial matters. His plan is to visit the house monthly to see if she wants to move in or if he can rent it out.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect. He had legal authority to manage the inheritance, which probably means he was appointed as an executor or power of attorney. If that's the case, then using the funds as per her instructions (to handle the will) might be within his rights. However, the inheritance is his wife's personal money, not joint property. Even if he had authority to manage the assets, he might still need her consent for major decisions, especially if the inheritance is separate from their marital assets.\n\nEmotionally, she was grieving, and he took advantage of her inability to make decisions during that time. Even if she gave him authority, using a significant portion of her inheritance without consulting her later could be seen as disrespectful. The fact that he plans to surprise her suggests he knows it's a big decision, which adds to the ethical concerns.\n\nFinancially, the house is an investment, but using her inheritance for this without her knowledge risks her feeling betrayed. Even if the investment is good, the lack of communication is a problem. The husband's reasoning about \"freeing up\" financially is his own, not necessarily hers. She might have different plans for the inheritance, like saving it or using it for other needs.\n\nIn many places, inheritances are considered separate property, especially if they are given to one spouse. So using it without the other spouse's knowledge could be problematic legally and ethically. The husband might have had the authority to manage the immediate affairs but not necessarily to make such a large financial decision on her behalf.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband acted without transparency and possibly overstepped his authority, even if he had legal power to manage the inheritance. The ethical issue here is more about respecting his wife's autonomy over her own inheritance and not making decisions that significantly impact her finances without her input.\n"
