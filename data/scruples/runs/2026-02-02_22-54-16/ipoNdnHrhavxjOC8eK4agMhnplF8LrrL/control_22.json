We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The husband had legal authority from his wife to handle her mother's affairs, including the inheritance. He used 40% of it to buy a house in Colorado without her knowledge. The wife was grieving and asked him to take care of financial matters during that time. The husband's reasoning is that he couldn't pass up the opportunity and wanted to use the inheritance to benefit their future.\n\nNow, legal authority is mentioned. If he was given legal power of attorney or similar, he might have had the right to act. But even with legal authority, using someone else's inheritance for a purchase without their consent could be ethically questionable. The wife might have expected the inheritance to be used for her, not for a joint purchase. \n\nMarriage usually involves shared financial decisions, even if they have separate assets. The inheritance is likely a personal asset of the wife unless they're in a community property state. Using a significant portion without her input could be seen as a breach of trust, regardless of legal standing. \n\nThe husband's plan to reveal it later might not address the immediate issue of transparency. Even if the wife consented to him handling the affairs, the use of the funds wasn't discussed. The surprise aspect could lead to hurt feelings and a breakdown in trust. \n\nEthically, even if it's legal, the lack of communication and the wife's conservative financial mindset not being considered might make the husband wrong. The fact that he felt the need to keep it secret suggests he knew it wasn't the right thing to do. \n\nSo, even with legal authority, the ethical implications of not being transparent and using her inheritance without her direct consent likely place the husband in the wrong.\n"
