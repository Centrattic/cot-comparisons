We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband used his wife's inheritance without telling her. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs because she was grieving and gave him that power. But he spent 40% of the inheritance on a new property in Colorado. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If he had legal authority, maybe he's not breaking any laws. But just because it's legal doesn't mean it's morally right. The wife didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving, so she gave him this power. But using a significant portion of her inheritance without her consent, even with the authority, might be a problem. \n\nThen there's the trust issue. Marriages require trust, and hiding a big purchase like a $650k house could damage that. Even if the husband's intentions are good, the act of secrecy is a big deal. The wife might feel betrayed, especially since it's her inheritance. Inheritances are often seen as personal, even if they're part of a joint account. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of a financial opportunity, and he plans to present the house as a possible move. But the problem is that he made a major financial decision without her input. Even if he thinks it's for both their benefit, it's a significant amount of money. The fact that he's considering using it as a rental or reselling if she doesn't like it suggests he's prepared for her to be upset, which indicates he knows he might be wrong.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions he's worried about being selfish. That shows some self-awareness. Even if he had the legal right, the moral and emotional aspects are important. The wife might feel her wishes were not respected, especially since she was in a vulnerable state (grieving). The authority she gave was likely for handling the will's implications, not for making a large investment on her behalf without her knowledge. \n\nSo even though he might not be legally in the wrong, morally and ethically, he probably is. The key points are secrecy, using her inheritance without her consent, and the potential harm to their relationship. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
