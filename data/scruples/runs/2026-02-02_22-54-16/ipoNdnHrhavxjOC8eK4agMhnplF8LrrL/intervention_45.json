We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The husband and wife have been married for 20 years. They have a condo with sentimental value. The wife inherited a large sum after her mother's death. The husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado without her knowledge, planning to use it as a rental or move there later. The husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of a financial opportunity without burdening her during her grief.\n\nNow, the ethical question here is about using someone else's money without their consent, even if given temporary authority. The husband had legal authority to handle the affairs, but does that extend to making such a significant financial decision without discussing it? Legal authority might allow handling the will and sorting the affairs, but spending a large portion of the inheritance on a property might be beyond that scope. The wife might not have anticipated such a use of her inheritance, especially since it's her mother's money. Even if the husband had her best interests in mind, the lack of transparency and the fact that it's her money could be a problem. The husband's plan to revisit the issue later might not mitigate the initial harm of making a big decision without her input. In many relationships, major financial decisions are joint, so this could be seen as a breach of trust. The husband's justification about the investment and future plans might be valid, but the secrecy and the use of her inheritance without her knowledge could be the main issues here. So, even if legally he had the authority, ethically, it's questionable. The answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he used her inheritance without her consent for a personal investment, even if he had legal authority. The key is whether the authority granted included such a large financial decision. If the authority was limited to handling the will and affairs, using 40% for a property purchase might be overstepping. The wife might feel her inheritance was misused, leading to the husband being in the wrong.\n"
