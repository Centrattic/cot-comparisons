We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance. So, first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe key points here are that the husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but he used the money without her consent beyond that authority. The wife was grieving and had given him the authority to sort through the will, but he went beyond that by spending a significant portion of the inheritance without consulting her.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he couldn't pass up the investment opportunity and he thought it would benefit them both eventually. He plans to check in with her later. But the main issue here is the lack of transparency and communication. Even though he had authority to handle the will, using the inheritance to buy a property without her knowledge crosses a line. Financial decisions of this magnitude should involve both partners, especially when it's someone else's inheritance. The wife may have different priorities for that money, and by acting unilaterally, he's disregarded her potential wishes and the trust in the marriage. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's keeping it a secret adds to the problem. While he might think he's making a good decision, the secrecy and lack of consent are problematic. In a marriage, major financial decisions typically require mutual agreement. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
