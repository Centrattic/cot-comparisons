We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves spending the wife's inheritance without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, the husband used 40% of her inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. He did this without her knowledge because she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial matters. \n\nThe key points here are consent and transparency. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, but did she explicitly give permission to spend the inheritance? The husband might argue that he was authorized, but using 40% for a personal investment (even if it's for their future) without discussing it with her could be a problem. \n\nIn many places, inheritance is considered individual property, not marital. So using her inheritance without consent could be a breach of trust. Even if he had legal authority to handle the affairs, the decision to spend the money on a home might be beyond the scope of that authority unless she specifically approved it. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning that he couldn't wait because of the market opportunity is his own decision. The wife's financial conservatism and her emotional state during grieving were factors he should have considered more carefully. \n\nThe husband's plan to reveal it gradually by visiting the property might not be the best approach. Honesty and upfront communication are crucial in a marriage. Keeping this a secret for so long could be seen as selfish and disrespectful to her autonomy over her own money.\n\nSo, even if the intentions were good (like planning for their future), the method\u2014making a major financial decision without consent\u2014likely makes the husband at fault.\n"
