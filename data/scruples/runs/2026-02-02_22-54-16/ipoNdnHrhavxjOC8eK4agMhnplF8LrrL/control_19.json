We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this scenario. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is married for 20 years, living in a condo with sentimental value. They want to buy a new house in Colorado, which they did using 40% of the wife's inheritance. The wife was grieving and gave the author legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. The author used that authority to make the purchase without her knowledge, planning to reveal it gradually.\n\nNow, the key points here are the legal authority given by the wife. Since she granted legal authority, he might have the right to manage the inheritance. However, the ethical question is about transparency. Even if he had the legal right to handle the inheritance, using a significant portion (40%) for a new property without her consent might be problematic. The wife might not have agreed to the specific use of the funds, even if she allowed him to handle the affairs. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that the wife didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving. But does that justify making such a major financial decision without her input? Inheritance is typically considered personal property unless jointly owned. If the inheritance was solely hers, even with legal authority, using a large portion without her knowledge could be seen as overstepping. \n\nMoreover, the author is planning to use the property as a rental or resale if the wife doesn't like it. This implies that the decision wasn't made with full transparency and mutual agreement. While the author might have good intentions, like improving their living situation or future financial benefits, the secrecy and the unilateral decision could harm trust in the marriage. \n\nIn many relationships, joint financial decisions, especially those involving large sums, require mutual agreement. Even if the legal rights are there, the ethical obligation to inform and involve the spouse is crucial. The author's actions might be legally permissible, but ethically, it's questionable because it bypasses the wife's autonomy in deciding how to use her inheritance. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they made a significant financial commitment without the wife's informed consent, which is a critical aspect of a healthy relationship.\n"
