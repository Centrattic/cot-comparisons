We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband used his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. They've been married for 20 years, and he had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. He had legal authority to manage the inheritance, so maybe he had the right to make decisions. But inheritance is typically the individual's property unless specified otherwise in the will. Even with legal authority, using someone else's money without their knowledge might be an issue, even if they were grieving.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The wife was grieving and asked him to handle the affairs, but did she give explicit consent to use the inheritance for real estate? The husband says he had to act quickly on an opportunity he had been eyeing. However, using 40% of the inheritance without consulting her after the initial request might be crossing a line. The husband's plan to check her opinion later seems like an afterthought. Trust and transparency are important in a marriage. Even if the intentions were good, not discussing such a significant financial decision could be seen as selfish.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions putting the rest into their joint portfolio. Maybe he thought he was acting in their best interest, but using her inheritance without her knowledge could cause long-term resentment. The wife might feel her inheritance was misused, especially if she wasn't consulted. The fact that he used the opportunity during her vulnerable time adds another layer of concern.\n\nSo, even though he had legal authority, the ethical implications of not involving her in such a major decision are significant. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the lack of transparency and potential misuse of her inheritance despite legal permissions.\n"
