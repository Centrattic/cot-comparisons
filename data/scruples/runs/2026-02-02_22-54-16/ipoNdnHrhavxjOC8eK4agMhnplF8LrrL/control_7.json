We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a property. \n\nFirst, the key points here are: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death and had given him authority to handle the will. He claims she didn't want to deal with financial matters at the time.\n\nNow, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the wife gave him legal authority to handle the will, he might have the right to manage those funds. But even with legal authority, spending someone else's inheritance without their consent, especially a spouse's, could be ethically questionable. Inheritance is typically personal property, so unless there's a joint account or specific permissions, using it without consultation might be wrong.\n\nEthically, even if she gave him authority to sort through the affairs, does that include spending a significant portion on a personal investment? The husband's reasoning is that he wanted to invest in real estate and saw an opportunity. But the wife might have different plans for the inheritance. Also, the husband mentions that the wife is more conservative, which might mean she values the money differently. Using it without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust, even if he had the legal authority initially.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. He says he plans to surprise her and see her reaction, but that's after the fact. Withholding information about such a large financial decision could hurt their relationship. Even if the outcome is positive, the secrecy is problematic. Marriage usually requires mutual agreement on major financial decisions, and spending a spouse's inheritance without discussing it first is a big deal.\n\nAlso, the husband's justification that he couldn't walk away from the opportunity might not hold up ethically. There's a responsibility to communicate and make joint decisions, especially regarding significant sums of money. The surprise approach could lead to resentment regardless of the result.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while he might have had legal authority, the ethical responsibility in a marriage involves transparency and mutual consent. The secrecy and lack of communication suggest that the husband is in the wrong, even if he had the power of attorney. The answer should be A.\n"
