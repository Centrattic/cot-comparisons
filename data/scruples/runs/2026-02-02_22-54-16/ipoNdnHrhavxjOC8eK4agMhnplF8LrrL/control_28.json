We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, which he used to make the purchase. He claims he did this because she didn't want to deal with financial matters while grieving, and he saw a good opportunity. Now, he's considering telling her and is seeking feedback.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether using the inheritance without her knowledge is wrong. Let's break it down. The inheritance is the wife's personal asset, right? Even if she gave him authority to handle the will, does that authority extend to using the money for joint financial decisions? Typically, inheritance is considered separate property unless it's commingled. But in this case, the husband used part of it for a new property and the rest into their joint portfolio. \n\nThe legal authority given by the wife was to handle her mother's affairs, which might include distributing the inheritance as per the will. However, using a portion of the inheritance to buy a property without her consent might be a problem. Even if she gave him the authority, that doesn't necessarily mean she authorized him to spend her money on a joint investment. The key here is whether the husband had explicit permission to use the funds for this purpose. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is that he wanted to avoid burdening his wife during her grieving period. While that's understandable, it doesn't necessarily justify making a major financial decision without her input. Trust and transparency are crucial in a marriage. The husband's action might be seen as a breach of trust, even if well-intentioned. \n\nMoreover, the husband plans to present the purchase as a surprise, which indicates he's aware that she might not approve. The fact that he's contemplating whether to tell her suggests he knows there's some ethical gray area here. \n\nLegally, if the inheritance was kept separate, the wife might have a claim against using it without her consent. Even if it's in a joint portfolio, mixing inherited funds with marital assets can complicate things. The husband's decision could be seen as a misuse of her assets, especially since it's a significant portion (40%) of the inheritance. \n\nIn terms of marital trust, secrets like this can lead to long-term issues. Even if the husband believes the move is for the better, the lack of communication is a problem. The wife might feel violated or disrespected, regardless of the outcome. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband is likely in the wrong. He made a major financial decision using his wife's inheritance without her knowledge or consent, which is a breach of trust and potentially against legal norms regarding separate assets in a marriage.\n"
