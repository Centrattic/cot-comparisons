We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband had legal authority from his wife to handle her mother's affairs. She gave him power of attorney while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. His reasoning was that he saw a good opportunity and didn't want to wait, especially since his wife didn't want to deal with financial matters during her grieving period.\n\nSo, legally, he had the authority. But ethically, there's a problem. Even if he had permission to handle the affairs, the inheritance is his wife's, not a joint asset. Using a significant portion without her knowledge and input might be a breach of trust. The wife might not be comfortable with how the money was spent, especially since it's a large amount (40% of a $650k property). Also, the fact that he's planning to use it as a surprise and then maybe sell it if she disagrees shows that he didn't consider her wishes in the long term. Even though he has a plan to revisit the decision, the secrecy and lack of transparency could damage their relationship. The husband's actions prioritize his own desires over the wife's potential feelings, even if he had the legal right. So while he might not be legally wrong, ethically he's in the wrong for not being transparent and involving his wife in such a major financial decision.\n"
