We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife have been married for 20 years. They live in a condo with sentimental value. The husband wants to buy a new house in Colorado using 40% of the wife's inheritance. He did this without her knowledge, even though he had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. The wife was grieving and asked him to manage the will, but the husband used the inheritance for the new property. Now he's worried if he's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are legal authority versus moral obligation. Legally, if he had the authority to handle the inheritance, maybe he's not breaking the law. But ethically, is it right to make such a big financial decision without the spouse's input? In most marriages, even if assets are joint, using a significant portion of an inheritance (which is often considered separate property) without the spouse's consent is a problem. Inheritances are typically seen as the recipient's personal property, but when it's used for shared decisions like a new home, that's where the conflict arises.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he did it to avoid burdening his wife during her grief and to take advantage of a financial opportunity. But even with good intentions, withholding such a major decision can be seen as a breach of trust. Spouses, even if they have different mindsets, usually expect to be part of big financial decisions. The husband's plan to \"surprise\" her if she likes it might backfire if she's upset about the lack of transparency. The fact that he's questioning his actions suggests he's aware of the moral dilemma.\n\nAlso, the use of \"legal authority\" might not cover all ethical aspects. If the authority was given for handling the will and affairs, but not for making purchases, then it's a stretch. The wife might not have intended him to use her inheritance for their joint benefit without her input. Inheritances can have emotional weight for the recipient, and using it without consent could cause hurt feelings, even if the husband thought it was for the best.\n\nIn summary, while there might not be a legal issue, the ethical and relational issues are significant. The husband's actions, though possibly well-intentioned, lack transparency and respect for his wife's autonomy over her inheritance. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
