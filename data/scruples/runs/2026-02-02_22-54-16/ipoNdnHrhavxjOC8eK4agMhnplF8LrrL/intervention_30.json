We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new house. The scenario is that the wife inherited money from her mother, and during her grieving period, she gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. He then used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the wife gave him legal authority to handle the affairs, then technically, he was acting within that authority. However, the question is about moral wrongdoing, not just legal. Even if he had legal power of attorney, using her inheritance without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nNext, the motivation. He mentions he wanted to take advantage of a financial opportunity and that he couldn't walk away from it. But the wife was grieving and asked him to handle the matters. The key point here is that he didn't ask for her permission to use the inheritance for the house. Even if she was grieving, she might have expected him to handle the funds as per her wishes, which she didn't specify. \n\nAlso, the fact that he bought a house without her knowledge and plans to keep it a secret until he visits her monthly to see her reaction. This secrecy might be the main issue. Trust is a cornerstone in a marriage, and using a significant portion of her inheritance without her input, even with legal authority, could be seen as selfish or disrespectful to her autonomy. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he's thinking about their future and their child, but the wife might feel that her inheritance, which is her personal asset, was used without her consent. Even if it's a joint portfolio, the inheritance might be considered her separate property. \n\nSo, while there might be legal grounds for his actions, the moral and ethical aspect is questionable. The husband didn't respect her autonomy over her inheritance, which is a significant financial asset. The secrecy and lack of communication are likely to cause conflict and hurt, even if his intentions were to benefit both of them. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he violated his wife's trust by using her inheritance without her explicit consent, despite having legal authority, and the secrecy surrounding the transaction shows a lack of respect for her financial decisions.\n"
