We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new house. \n\nFirst, the key points: The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs during her time of grieving. The author used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. He didn't consult her further because he thought she didn't want to deal with financial matters while grieving. His plan is to let her know gradually by visiting the property monthly.\n\nNow, considering legal authority. If the wife explicitly gave him legal power of attorney to handle the inheritance, then technically he might have the right. But inheritance is typically considered the individual's property unless specified otherwise in a will or by marital law. Even if he had authority, using a significant portion of it without her knowledge for a personal decision (like a new home) might cross a line. \n\nMarital trust is crucial here. Even if he had permission to handle the affairs, using a large portion of the inheritance for a purchase that affects both their lives without consulting her could be a breach of trust. The wife might view the inheritance as her personal asset, especially after her mother's passing. The author's decision to surprise her might be seen as paternalistic, even if well-intentioned. \n\nAlso, the author's plan to use the house as a rental or sell it if she disapproves shows he's aware of the risk, which might imply he's uncertain if it's right. The fact that he's seeking advice on Reddit suggests he's conflicted. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, spouses might not automatically share in each other's inheritances unless specified by law. However, the ethical aspect of trust and communication in a long-term marriage is significant. Even if legal, acting without transparency could harm the relationship. \n\nSo, while the author might not be legally in the wrong if he had proper authority, ethically, it's questionable. The lack of communication and the potential for the wife to feel her assets were misused could make the author at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A."
