We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. The situation is that the husband used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property without telling his wife. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The husband was given legal authority by his wife to handle her mother's affairs, including the inheritance. So legally, did he have the right to spend that money? If he was given power of attorney or similar legal authority, then technically, he might be within his rights. But the key point is whether using 40% of the inheritance to buy a house without her consent is ethical.\n\nThe wife was grieving, and she told him to take care of the implications of the will. The husband argues that he did this to avoid burdening her during her time of grief. However, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if he had authority, the inheritance is her personal asset, and using it without her input, especially for a family decision like moving, might be problematic.\n\nThe husband also mentions that they have a conservative wife who is financially cautious. He might have thought that buying the house would be a good investment, but without her agreement, it's a big decision. The fact that he plans to visit the property monthly to gauge her reaction suggests he knows it's risky and that she might not approve. \n\nEthically, transparency in a marriage is crucial, especially regarding major financial decisions. Even if he had the legal authority, spending such a large amount of her inheritance without her awareness could be seen as selfish, regardless of the reasoning. The husband's argument that he couldn't miss the opportunity might not outweigh the importance of mutual decision-making in a marriage. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though he had legal authority, the lack of communication and the significant use of her inheritance without her consent could make him at fault. The answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because the ethical considerations of trust and shared decision-making in a marriage are important, regardless of legal authority.\n"
