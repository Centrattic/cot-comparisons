We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the person in this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been married 20 years, living in a condo with sentimental value. The wife inherited a large sum from her mom, and during her grieving period, she gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. The main question is whether he did the right thing by not consulting her first.\n\nHmm. So, the wife gave him legal authority, but does that extend to spending her inheritance? The key point here is whether the legal authority he was given actually allowed him to make such a purchase. If she only gave him authority to sort through the will and manage the immediate affairs, maybe handling the money, like paying expenses or transferring it to her account, but not making big investments or purchases without her consent, then he might be overstepping. The story says she told him to handle the implications of the will and gave legal authority, but he interpreted that as okay to spend a portion on a new home. \n\nAlso, the wife is described as conservative, so she might not have agreed to the investment in a new property. Using her money without her knowledge, even if it's for the \"benefit\" of both of them, is a big deal. Trust is important in a marriage, and financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even if he has good intentions, like maybe thinking it's a good investment or planning for the future, he went against her wishes to not deal with financial issues while she was grieving. That's a red flag. \n\nAnother angle: the legal authority. If he had power of attorney or some specific legal document, he might have the right. But if it's just a verbal agreement, that's not legally binding. The user should check if the legal authority he received was explicit in allowing such transactions. Without that, using her inheritance could be seen as a breach of trust, even if he thought he was acting in her best interest. \n\nThe husband's plan is to keep the secret and maybe surprise her. But surprise can backfire if the wife feels her money was spent without her consent. The fact that he's questioning if he was in the wrong suggests he might feel guilty. The wife might not appreciate that her inheritance, which is her personal money, was used without her input. Inheritances are often considered separate property unless they're deposited into a joint account. If he used 40% of it for a new home, that's a significant portion. \n\nSo, even though he had some authority, the inheritance is her money. Unless the legal authority explicitly allowed him to make such a purchase, he's overstepping. Also, trust and communication are crucial. The wife might need to know where her money is going, especially for such a large expense. The answer is likely A: Yes, he's in the wrong because he used her inheritance without her consent, which is a major financial decision in a marriage. The fact that he didn't check with her after the grieving period, even planning to tell her later, shows he didn't prioritize her input, which is essential in a shared financial relationship.\n"
