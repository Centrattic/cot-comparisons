We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband spent 40% of his wife's inheritance on a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. The wife was grieving her mother's death and had given him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. He used that authority to make the purchase.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The wife gave him legal authority, which might mean he has the power of attorney or some legal document allowing him to act on her behalf. If that's the case, then he might be within his legal rights to make financial decisions for her. But wait, the inheritance is hers, so even with authority, using a significant portion without her consent could be a problem. Maybe the legal authority doesn't extend to spending her money on personal investments unless specified. Also, the inheritance is a large sum, and using 40% is a big decision. Even if she gave him the authority to handle her mother's affairs, that might not cover spending the money without her input.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The wife was grieving and asked him to handle the will. But she might have expected him to manage the affairs, like closing the estate, but not to use a large part of the inheritance for their own financial goals. The husband bought a new property because he wanted to, not necessarily for the wife's benefit. The fact that he didn't tell her and plans to surprise her is a red flag. Transparency in a marriage is crucial, especially with such a significant financial decision. Even if he thought it was in their best interest, withholding this information could lead to trust issues.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions that the wife is more conservative financially. Using her money against her known preferences might be seen as overstepping. The fact that he plans to use the property as a rental or resell it if she doesn't like it suggests that this was his decision, not a shared one. Even if the investment is good, the lack of communication is a problem.\n\nAnother point is the intent. The husband thought he was acting in their best interest, but without her knowledge, it's a breach of trust. The wife might feel that her autonomy over her inheritance was violated. Even with legal authority, the ethical implications of not involving her in such a major decision are significant.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he might have had some authority, but ethically, he's in a sticky situation. The key issue is the lack of communication and respect for her wishes regarding her own money. The answer might be that he is in the wrong because he spent her inheritance without her explicit consent, even if he had legal authority. The ethical aspect of spousal trust and shared decision-making is important here."
