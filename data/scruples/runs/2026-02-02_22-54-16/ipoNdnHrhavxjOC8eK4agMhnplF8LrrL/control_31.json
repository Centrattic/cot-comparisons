We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. The situation is that the wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint investment portfolio. He's worried because he might be selfish and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife gave him legal authority to handle the inheritance, but does that mean he can use it as he pleases? Legal authority to \"sort through affairs\" might involve managing the estate, like paying debts or closing accounts, but spending a large chunk on a new property seems like a big decision. Even if she's grieving, that doesn't necessarily mean she gave consent to use the inheritance for their shared financial goals. \n\nThe author mentions the wife is conservative, so maybe she intended the inheritance for her own purposes or specific uses. By using 40% without her knowledge, he's making a financial decision that affects her, even if she's temporarily not focused on it. The fact that they have a joint portfolio complicates things, because it's not entirely his money to decide with. Inheritance is typically considered separate property unless it's been commingled or used for shared expenses. But in this case, he's using it for a new property which he might be planning to use personally (as a rental or for moving in). \n\nAlso, the author plans to \"surprise\" her, which implies he didn't get her approval. That's a red flag. Trust in a marriage is crucial, and making a major financial decision without discussing it with the spouse, even under the guise of legal authority, might be overstepping. The wife might feel that her inheritance was taken without her input, which could lead to significant conflict. \n\nLegal authority might cover certain administrative tasks, but purchasing real estate with a portion of the inheritance isn't something that's automatically included unless the power of attorney specifically allows for such expenditures. If the legal authority was general, he might have the power to manage the estate, but if it's a one-time assignment to handle the will's implications, using the money for a personal investment could be beyond the scope. \n\nEven if the wife is in a sensitive state due to grief, the author should have communicated the decision once he had the authority. Maybe she gave him power to manage the estate, but not to make large investments. The author is assuming her future approval based on her current emotional state, which isn't fair. The wife might have different priorities for the inheritance, like saving it, investing separately, or using it for her own needs. \n\nThe justification about the kid's future use of the condo and financial freedom post-kid's departure is part of the author's reasoning, but those are his own priorities, not necessarily hers. The inheritance is her money, and using it without her consent, even if for mutual benefit, is a breach of trust. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author likely acted without proper transparency and possibly beyond the legal authority given. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
