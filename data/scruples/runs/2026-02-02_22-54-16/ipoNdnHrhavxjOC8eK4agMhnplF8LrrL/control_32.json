We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The wife received an inheritance from her mother. The husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. The husband didn't tell the wife about this decision, saying it was because she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grief. Now he's considering telling her and is seeking opinions.\n\nSo, the main issues here are legal authority vs. trust, and financial decisions without consent. The husband had legal authority, but does legal authority mean he can make all decisions without consulting his wife? Also, the inheritance is the wife's, right? Even if she gave him the authority, spending a portion of her inheritance without her knowledge might be a problem, especially if it's a significant amount.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, when someone is given power of attorney or legal authority to handle affairs, they still have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the principal (the wife in this case). That means they should make decisions that benefit her, not necessarily the couple's joint interests unless that's what she wants. But here, the husband used the inheritance for a joint purchase, which might not align with her wishes.\n\nAdditionally, inheritance is typically considered separate property, not marital. So even though they are married, the inheritance belongs to the wife alone. Using it without her consent, even with legal authority, might be crossing a line. The husband might have the legal right to manage the inheritance, but the ethical aspect is about trust and transparency in the marriage. Marital trust is important, and making such a significant financial decision without discussing it with the spouse, even if the spouse was grieving, could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nAnother angle: the husband's reasoning. He mentions that she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grief, so he made the decision. But is that a valid excuse for not informing her later? He should have communicated once the situation allowed, rather than keeping it secret. The fact that he's planning to tell her now is a step, but the secrecy itself is problematic.\n\nAlso, the husband's plan to use the property as a rental or sell it if the wife doesn't like it shows that he's considering his own interests and the couple's future, but the initial decision without her input could lead to conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or betrayed, which can damage the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he might have had the authority, but ethically, by not consulting his wife after the initial grief period and making a major financial decision affecting her inheritance, he's in the wrong. The secrecy and lack of transparency are key factors here.\n"
