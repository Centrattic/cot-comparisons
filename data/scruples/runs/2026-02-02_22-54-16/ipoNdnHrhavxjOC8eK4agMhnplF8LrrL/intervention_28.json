We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. The key points here are consent, authority, and transparency.\n\nFirst, the husband was given legal authority by his wife to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. The question is, does that authority extend to spending 40% of her inheritance without her knowledge? The wife might have given him power of attorney for administrative tasks, like settling the will, but does that include making a large financial decision like buying a house? Probably not. Legal authority to sort through affairs might not imply permission to make such a significant investment.\n\nThen there's the issue of transparency. Even if the husband meant well, using a large portion of the inheritance without discussing it with his wife afterward is a problem. Financial decisions that affect shared assets should be mutual, especially when it's the wife's inheritance. The husband's reasoning is that he didn't want to burden her while she was grieving, but that doesn't negate the need for full disclosure later. The surprise approach could be seen as deceitful, even if his intentions were good.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions putting the rest in their joint investment portfolio. That makes it a shared asset, so using part of the inheritance without her input affects their joint finances. Even if he planned to discuss it later, keeping it secret and then springing it on her could damage trust. The wife might feel disrespected and betrayed, regardless of the husband's intentions.\n\nThe husband's plan to check in on her feelings monthly might be a good step, but the initial action was unilateral. The moral wrong here is not just about the action itself, but about the lack of communication and the breach of trust. In a marriage, major financial decisions should be made together, even if one partner is more conservative. The husband's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, lack the necessary transparency and mutual agreement.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband did have some authority, but the use of the inheritance without full disclosure and consent is a breach of trust. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
