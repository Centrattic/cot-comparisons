We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The couple has been married for 20 years, living in a condo with sentimental value. The wife inherited a large sum after her mother's death and gave the husband authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. The husband used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without telling her. He plans to check in monthly on her feelings about it and has options for the property depending on her reaction.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the wife gave him authority to manage her mother's affairs, does that include the right to spend the inheritance? Typically, inheritance is considered the individual's property unless specified otherwise in a will or by marital law. If the husband had legal authority, maybe through a power of attorney or specific instructions from the wife, he might have some leeway. But using 40% for a personal investment without full disclosure is a gray area. Even with authority, the wife's inheritance is her asset, and major financial decisions usually require mutual consent in a marriage.\n\nEthically, transparency is crucial. The wife was grieving and might not have been in the right state to make financial decisions, so the husband might have thought he was helping. However, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her knowledge, even for something they might both benefit from, is a breach of trust. Marriages typically expect joint decision-making on large financial matters, especially involving one spouse's personal assets.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he couldn't pass up the investment opportunity. But the lack of communication is a big issue. Even if he thought he was acting in their best interest, withholding such a major purchase is problematic. The wife might feel her inheritance was misused, leading to resentment. Additionally, the husband's plan to \"test\" her reaction by visiting monthly seems passive-aggressive and doesn't address the initial secrecy.\n\nIn many places, marital property laws can vary. If the inheritance is considered separate property, the husband shouldn't have used it without consent. Even if he had power of attorney, that's usually for managing affairs, not making large investments with someone else's money. There's a risk of legal issues if the wife objects later.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the husband likely overstepped. Even with the wife's initial authority to handle affairs, using a large chunk of her inheritance for a personal purchase without her knowledge is wrong. The answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
