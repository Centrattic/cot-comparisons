We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property.\n\nFirst, the key points: The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her because she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grief.\n\nHmm. So the legal authority is important here. If she gave him explicit legal power to manage the inheritance, then he might have the right to use the funds as per her instructions. But wait, she said to handle the implications, which might be about settling the will and expenses, not necessarily using the money for their own purposes. \n\nHe mentions he bought the house because he saw an opportunity, but the wife might not have wanted her inheritance used for that. Even if she was grieving, once she's done, finding out that her inheritance was used without her consent could be a big issue. Inheritance is typically considered separate property unless it's commingled. By putting part into their joint portfolio, maybe he's mixing separate and joint funds, which could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the house in Colorado is a new property. If he didn't consult her about a major purchase that uses her inheritance, that's a breach of trust. Even if he had the legal authority, using her money without her knowledge for his own investment decisions might not be right. The intention to tell her later might not matter if the act itself is deceptive. \n\nMarriage requires transparency and shared decisions, especially about significant financial moves that affect her assets. While he had the authority, using her inheritance for their benefit without her input could be seen as selfish. The fact that he's considering whether to tell her now suggests he's aware it's a problem. \n\nSo putting it all together: The author used his wife's inheritance without her knowledge, even though he had legal authority. The key is whether the authority included the right to spend the inheritance on personal investments. Since the wife might not have intended that, and using her inheritance without her input is a breach of trust, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong).\n"
