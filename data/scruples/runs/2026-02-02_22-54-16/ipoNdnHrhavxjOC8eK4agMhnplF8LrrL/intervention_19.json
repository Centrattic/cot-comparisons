We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. The situation involves using 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used that authority to access the inheritance. But does legal authority extend to making such a large financial decision without consulting her? Inheritance is typically considered separate property, even in a marriage. Unless there's a specific agreement, using someone else's inheritance without their consent could be problematic, even if they gave authority for other matters.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The wife was grieving and asked him to handle the will's implications. However, buying a $650k property with her inheritance might not fall under \"handling the will's implications.\" It's a significant investment decision that affects their joint finances. Even if he thought it was for their benefit, secrecy here could be seen as a breach of trust. Marriages require transparency, especially with such large financial moves. The fact that he plans to surprise her but is now doubting whether he should tell her suggests he's aware of the potential ethical issues.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes wanting to move to Colorado and considering the property as a potential rental or resale. But using inheritance meant for her, perhaps as a safety net, without her input could be seen as selfish. The wife's conservative financial mindset versus his more aggressive approach might lead to conflict. Even if he had the legal authority, the ethical implications of not discussing such a major purchase with his spouse are significant.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, inheritances are considered separate property. So using part of it without her consent could be legally questionable. Even if he had the authority to handle her mother's affairs, using the funds for a joint purchase without her agreement might not be covered under that authority. The key here is consent. The wife never explicitly approved using her inheritance for this purpose. The fact that he did it in secret shows a lack of transparency, which is crucial in a marriage.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely acted unilaterally on a major financial decision using his wife's inheritance without her knowledge or consent. Even if he had legal authority for some tasks, this specific use of funds wasn't agreed upon. The ethical and possibly legal implications suggest he is in the wrong.\n"
