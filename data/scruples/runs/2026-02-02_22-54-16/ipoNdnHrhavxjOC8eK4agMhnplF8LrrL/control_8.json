We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the husband used his wife's authority given during her mother's will to spend 40% of her inheritance on a property in Colorado. The rest went into their joint portfolio. The wife was grieving, and he acted without her consent.\n\nLegal rights: The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. But does that include the right to spend the inheritance without her knowledge? Maybe she gave broad authority, but inheritance is a personal matter. Even if she allowed him to handle the will, using the funds for a shared investment without her input might be an overstep.\n\nTrust and communication: Marriage typically requires transparency about major financial decisions. Even if the husband thought he was acting in their best interest, the secrecy is a problem. Couples usually discuss big purchases, so using the inheritance without her consent, especially after she was grieving, could damage trust.\n\nIntentions: The husband's plan is to use the property for their benefit, but the method was secretive. Whether his intentions are good doesn't matter if the action breaches trust. The wife might feel her inheritance, which is her personal asset, was used without her approval.\n\nSentimental value of the condo: He mentions not wanting to sell their home, but using her inheritance for this new property ignores her potential feelings about how the money is used. Inheritance can be emotionally significant, especially after losing a parent.\n\nFuture implications: If the wife discovers this, it could lead to conflict. Even if the investment is good, the lack of communication is a red flag. The husband's plan to \"visit once a month\" to gauge her reaction is risky and could be seen as manipulative.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband might have had a reason, the secrecy and lack of discussion about using her inheritance makes him at fault. The trust and transparency in a marriage are key here.\n"
