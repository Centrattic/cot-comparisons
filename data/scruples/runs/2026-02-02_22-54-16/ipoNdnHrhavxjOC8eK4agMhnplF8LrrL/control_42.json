We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. The situation is that the husband used 40% of her inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint investment portfolio. He did this without her knowledge, even though she gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife gave him legal authority to manage her mother's will, which he used to access the inheritance. So, does having legal authority mean he can spend the money as he sees fit? Maybe not. Legal authority to sort through affairs usually means handling the estate's matters, like distributing assets as per the will, not necessarily spending the money on personal investments. \n\nHe bought a property without her knowledge. The wife didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grieving period, so he took that as an opportunity. But even if she gave him the authority to handle the will, using a portion of her inheritance for a new home without her consent seems like a breach of trust. The money is her inheritance, which is typically considered personal, especially after the mother's passing. \n\nHe mentions that they have a sentimental attachment to their current condo and that the new house could be for their son or as a rental. However, the key issue here is whether he had the right to make such a significant financial decision on her behalf. Even if he had authority over the will process, the inheritance is her asset now, and major purchases like a $650k property without her input might not be justified. \n\nThe husband's plan to visit the property and see her reaction later isn't really a solution. He should have discussed it with her first. The fact that he didn't and that the wife might not have wanted the money used that way means he's in the wrong. Trust in a marriage is crucial, and making a big decision without her involvement, especially with her inheritance, is a serious matter. \n\nSo, even though he had the legal authority, the ethical aspect is about transparency and mutual decision-making in marriage. The answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong) because using her inheritance without her knowledge, despite the authority, is a misuse of her money and violates the trust between spouses.\n"
