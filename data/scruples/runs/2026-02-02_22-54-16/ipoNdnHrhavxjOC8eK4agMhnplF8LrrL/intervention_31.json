We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The husband and wife have been married for 20 years. They own a condo with sentimental value. The wife received an inheritance from her mom's death. The husband was given legal authority to handle the affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. He kept it secret because she didn't want financial issues during her grieving period. His plan is to see if she's okay with moving there or using it as a rental.\n\nNow, the key points here are: legal authority, the wife's wishes during grieving, and the use of the inheritance. The husband had legal authority to handle her affairs, but does that mean he can spend the inheritance as he sees fit? Inheritance is usually considered the recipient's property unless specified otherwise. Even with legal authority, using a large portion without her knowledge might be a problem. The wife might not have intended for him to make such a big purchase without consulting her. Also, the husband's motives are mixed\u2014he wanted to buy a house in Colorado because he had his eye on it, but he didn't discuss it with her. Even if he thought she was too overwhelmed to make decisions, that's a reason to wait until she was ready, not to make the decision himself. The fact that he plans to reveal it gradually and see her reaction might help, but the secrecy is a big issue. Trust is important in a marriage, and using her inheritance without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. Plus, the money was her inheritance, which might be considered her personal asset, not joint property unless they are in a community property state. So even if they have a joint portfolio, the initial spending of 40% without her consent could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, he did have legal authority to handle the affairs, so maybe he was acting within the scope of that authority. But legal authority doesn't necessarily give him the right to make such a significant financial decision without her input, especially since it's her inheritance. The line between managing her affairs and making autonomous decisions is blurry here. The husband's reasoning that he couldn't miss the opportunity might not justify the secrecy. There's also a power dynamic where the wife is in a vulnerable state (grieving), which the husband is exploiting by making decisions for her without her consent once she's ready.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband likely overstepped his authority. Even with legal permission to handle the affairs, using the inheritance for a major purchase without her knowledge is probably not acceptable. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he misused her inheritance without her consent, despite having legal authority, which doesn't cover making such a significant decision unilaterally, especially when it's her personal inheritance.\n"
