We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's look at the situation carefully. The author is married for 20 years, living in a condo with sentimental value. They wanted to buy a new house in Colorado, which they did using 40% of their wife's inheritance without her knowing. The wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs during her grieving period. \n\nFirst, legal authority to handle the affairs might include managing the inheritance, but does that mean he can spend it without her consent? The inheritance is her money, right? Even if she gave him the authority, the main purpose of that authority was probably to settle the will and manage the affairs, not to make big purchases. Using 40% of the inheritance to buy a house without discussing it with his wife seems like a major decision. Especially since they have a joint investment portfolio, maybe the wife would have wanted the inheritance to be handled differently.\n\nThe author mentions that the wife didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving, but that's not really an excuse. He had the opportunity and decided to act on it without consulting her. The wife's preferences about being conservative with finances might have meant she would not have agreed to use the inheritance this way. Also, the house was bought as a potential future home for their kid, but the wife might have had different plans for the inheritance, like saving it or using it for other family needs.\n\nEven though the author plans to check in with her monthly, keeping such a big decision a secret until then could be considered selfish. The wife has the right to know how her money is being used, especially a significant portion of her inheritance. The surprise might be appreciated if she likes it, but if she's upset, the secrecy could cause more harm. It's about respect and transparency in a marriage. Big financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, and using her inheritance without her input could be seen as a breach of trust. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
