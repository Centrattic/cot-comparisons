We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the husband did something wrong by secretly spending his wife's inheritance. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe husband and wife have been married for 20 years, living in the same condo for 10. They have a kid who's grown up. The husband wants to buy a new house, thinking maybe for their kid in the future. The wife inherited a large sum from her mom, passed away, and she was an only child. The husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs because she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. He didn't tell her because she didn't want to deal with financial stuff while grieving. He plans to check in on her feelings about it later.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here. First, legal authority. He had the legal right to handle the inheritance, so maybe that's a good point. But does legal authority mean he can spend it without her consent? Even if she gave him legal power of attorney, there's also the aspect of trust and communication in a marriage. \n\nIn most places, an inheritance is considered separate property, not marital property, unless it's commingled. But even if he had authority to manage it, using 40% for a new property without her knowledge might be an issue. The wife might have expected that any use of her inheritance would require her consent, even if she was grieving. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is that he couldn't pass up the investment opportunity. But in a marriage, major financial decisions typically require mutual agreement. Even if he had the legal right to handle the affairs, spending a large portion of her inheritance without discussing it afterward could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe fact that he plans to surprise her might not go well. If she didn't know about it, she might feel he violated her trust. Even if he thought it was for the benefit of both, the secrecy is a problem. There's also the aspect of transparency. Marriages require openness, and major financial decisions shouldn't be made without the other person's input, even if there's legal authority. \n\nSo, even if he had the legal right, the ethical aspect is questionable. The wife might feel her inheritance, which is a personal asset, was used without her consent. The husband's action could be seen as taking advantage of her vulnerability during her grief to make a decision that affects her assets. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he used her inheritance without her knowledge, which is a breach of trust and potentially a misuse of her assets, even if he had legal authority to handle the affairs. The key is that the inheritance is her personal money, and spending a significant portion without her input is ethically wrong.\n"
