We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband and wife have been married for 20 years. They own a condo with sentimental value. The wife inherited a large sum from her mother. The husband got legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio. He did this without her knowledge, thinking she didn't want to deal with finances while grieving. Now he's considering telling her or using the property as a rental if she doesn't like the idea.\n\nHmm. The key points here are legal authority and intent. The wife gave him legal authority to handle the affairs, so technically he had permission. But did that permission extend to spending the inheritance? The husband says she told him to take care of the implications of the will, which might include managing the assets. But using 40% for a new property without her consent... even if she gave authority, maybe there's a difference between managing affairs and making major financial decisions. \n\nAlso, the inheritance is hers. Even if it's in a joint portfolio, the original money is her inheritance. The husband's actions might be seen as using her money without her explicit consent for a personal investment. Even if he thought it was for their benefit, the lack of transparency is a big issue. Trust is important in a marriage. He didn't consult her, even though she's the one who inherited the money. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he didn't want to burden her during grieving and saw a good opportunity. But he could have waited until she was ready or discussed it once she was more settled. The fact that he decided on his own might be seen as selfish, regardless of the perceived benefits. Plus, the property is in Colorado, and it's unclear if they plan to move there or use it as a rental. The wife might not agree with the investment or the use of her money. \n\nEven if the husband had the legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, the inheritance is her separate property unless it's considered marital property. Depending on the state, inherited money is typically separate, so the husband might not have the right to use it without her consent. So legally, maybe he overstepped, even if he had authority for the will's implications. \n\nThe husband's plan to check in monthly is proactive, but the initial decision was made without her. The question is about right and wrong. Ethically, using her inheritance without her knowledge, even with legal authority, could be wrong because it's her money. The intent was for their benefit, but the action of making a major financial decision without her input is problematic. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he used her inheritance without her consent, even if he had authority for other tasks. The inheritance is specifically hers, and using it without her explicit approval for a shared property is a breach of trust.\n"
