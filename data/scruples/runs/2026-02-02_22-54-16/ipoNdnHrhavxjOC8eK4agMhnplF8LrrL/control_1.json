We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The husband and wife have been married 20 years, living in the same condo. The wife received an inheritance from her mother's will, which the husband was given legal authority to handle while she was grieving. He used 40% of it to buy a house in Colorado and the rest into their joint portfolio without her knowledge. He wants to surprise her and see her reaction, planning to move in or rent it out if she's not on board.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The wife was grieving and gave him legal authority to handle the will. But did that authority extend to spending a large portion of the inheritance on a new house? Legal authority might cover settling the estate, like paying debts or distributing assets, but not necessarily making financial decisions that affect the couple's joint finances. The inheritance is her money, not theirs, so even if they are married, the wife's inheritance is her separate property unless they're in a community property state. \n\nAlso, using 40% of the inheritance without consulting her, especially for a major purchase like a house, seems like a breach of trust. Even if he thought it was in their best interest, the trust and communication are key in a marriage. He didn't wait to discuss after she was ready, which could lead to resentment. The fact that he's trying to keep it a secret to avoid conflict shows he knows it's a risky move.\n\nThe husband's justification is that he couldn't pass up the opportunity in Colorado. But he had prior knowledge of the market, so maybe the timing was convenient. Also, the fact that he's using this as a way to potentially benefit them both doesn't negate the fact that he made a unilateral decision with her money. Even if the house appreciates, the ethical issue here is about transparency and mutual decision-making in a relationship.\n\nIn many cases, spouses are expected to be transparent about major financial decisions, especially when it involves the other's inheritance. The husband's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, undermine his wife's autonomy over her inheritance. The answer likely leans towards A, he's in the wrong, because he used her money without her consent, even if he had authority over the will's implications. The legal authority might cover administrative tasks, not financial investments.\n"
