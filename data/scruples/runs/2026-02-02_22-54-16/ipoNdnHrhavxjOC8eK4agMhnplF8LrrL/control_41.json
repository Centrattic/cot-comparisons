We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. The situation involves a 20-year marriage, a kid who's left home, and a recent inheritance from the wife's mother. The husband used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without the wife's knowledge, using the authority she gave him to handle her mother's affairs during her grieving period.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the wife gave him the authority, maybe through a power of attorney or some legal documents, he might have been allowed to act on her behalf. However, using the inheritance for a personal investment rather than just handling the affairs might be a problem. Inheritance is usually considered separate property unless it's a community property state. If they're in a community property state, some of the inheritance might be considered marital, but that's not mentioned here. The key point is whether he had the authority to use the inheritance in this way.\n\nEthically, even if he had legal authority, taking a significant portion of the inheritance without consulting the wife after the grieving period might be seen as wrong. The wife might expect to have control over her inheritance, especially after her mother's death. The husband's decision to proceed without transparency could lead to trust issues. The fact that he's keeping it a secret and planning to see her reaction later suggests a lack of communication and respect for her autonomy in financial decisions. Even if the intention was to benefit them both, the method of acting unilaterally, especially with such a large sum, is problematic. The husband's justification that he couldn't miss the opportunity might not outweigh the need for mutual consent in major financial decisions. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of transparency and potential misuse of the inheritance despite the legal authority given.\n"
