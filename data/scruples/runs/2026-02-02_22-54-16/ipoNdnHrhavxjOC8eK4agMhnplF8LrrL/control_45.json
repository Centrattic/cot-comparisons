We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author of a Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance. The key points here are the legal authority given and the secrecy involved.\n\nFirst, the wife gave the author legal authority to sort through her mother's affairs while she was grieving. So, legally, he might have the power to manage that money. But using 40% to buy a house without her knowledge is a big issue. Even if she was in a vulnerable state, once the opportunity arose, he made a significant financial decision on her behalf. \n\nInheritance is a personal asset unless specified otherwise in a will or legal agreement. The wife might not have intended for him to use those funds without her input. The fact that he kept it secret and didn't consult her about such a major purchase is problematic. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and making a decision like this without transparency could harm that. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he didn't want to burden her during a tough time, but that doesn't justify withholding information. Financial decisions of this magnitude should be mutual. Also, the potential for the property to appreciate is a given, but the wife might have different financial priorities. \n\nSo, even though he had legal authority, the ethical part is about the lack of communication. The answer is likely A, he's in the wrong because of the secrecy and not respecting her autonomy over her inheritance.\n"
