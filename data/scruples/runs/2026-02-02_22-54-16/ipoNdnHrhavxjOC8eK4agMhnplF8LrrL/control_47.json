We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Hmm.\n\nSo the situation is: the wife received a large inheritance from her mother. The husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint investment portfolio. He didn't tell her because she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grief. His plan is to check in monthly and maybe surprise her with moving there, or if not, use it as a rental.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The husband had legal authority from the wife to manage the affairs, but does that include spending the inheritance? Legal authority might involve tasks like sorting through the mother's will, paying off debts, handling the estate, but does it extend to purchasing a new house? Maybe the wife gave him power of attorney specifically for those tasks related to the will, not for making major financial decisions. So using her inheritance for a personal investment might be beyond that scope.\n\nAlso, the wife was grieving and he did this without her knowledge. Even if she gave him some authority, there's a trust issue here. She might not have intended for him to use her inheritance for a house that's more for their benefit. Inheritances are often considered separate property, unless the wife explicitly puts it into a joint account. But in this case, he put the remaining 60% into their joint portfolio. If they are in a common-law marriage or community property state, that might be okay, but in many places, inheritances are separate. So he might have commingled her funds.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The wife didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving, but the husband still used her money. Even if he thought he was helping by not burdening her during a hard time, the decision was made without her consent. That's a big red flag. She might not have agreed to the use of her inheritance for a new home, especially one with sentimental value from the previous condo. The new house in Colorado could be a personal preference of the husband, not the wife, which might be considered selfish.\n\nThe husband's plan to visit monthly and see her reaction is a bit of a backdoor approach. The wife has the right to know how her inheritance is being used. Surprise can be seen as a lack of transparency and trust, which are crucial in a marriage. The husband is assuming she would like the move or the investment, but the wife might have different plans for the inheritance, like saving it, investing it differently, or using it for other purposes.\n\nAlso, the fact that the husband is using the inheritance without her knowledge and then potentially reselling the house if she doesn't like it\u2014this shows that he's making a significant financial decision without her input. Even if he sees it as a good opportunity, the fact that it's her money means she should have a say.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical aspects, legally, if the inheritance was given to the wife as her separate property and the husband used it without her consent, that could be a problem. Ethically, it's about respecting her wishes and not making decisions that could have long-term financial implications without her knowledge. The husband's action might be seen as a breach of trust, regardless of the legal authority.\n\nSo putting it all together, even if the husband had legal authority to handle the affairs, using her inheritance for a personal investment without her knowledge seems wrong. The wife's consent isn't there, and the husband is taking a risk that could backfire. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
