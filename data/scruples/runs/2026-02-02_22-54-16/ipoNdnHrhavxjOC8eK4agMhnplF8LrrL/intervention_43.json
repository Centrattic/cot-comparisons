We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a house.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The husband and wife have been married 20 years. The wife received an inheritance from her mother, and he was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs because she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint investment portfolio. The husband didn't tell her about the purchase because he thought she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grief. Now he's considering telling her or keeping it a secret, hoping she'll like it as a surprise.\n\nLegally, if he had the legal authority to act on her behalf, maybe through a power of attorney, then using the funds according to her wishes might be okay. But the question is about moral wrong, not just legal. Even if it's legal, was it ethical to spend a significant portion of her inheritance without her knowledge, even if she was grieving? \n\nInheritances are often considered personal property, especially if it's from a family member. Even in a joint account, using a large portion for a personal purchase without consulting her might be seen as overstepping. The husband's plan to use it as a rental or sell it if she doesn't like it suggests he's considering the financial aspects, but not her emotional response. The wife might feel betrayed, especially since it's her inheritance. Trust is a big part of a marriage, and keeping such a secret could damage that trust. \n\nThe husband's justification is that he was acting in her best interest by not burdening her during grief. But that's a bit of a stretch. Handling the will and finances is one thing, but making a major financial decision that uses a significant portion of her inheritance without her consent is another. Even with authority, there's an expectation of transparency and consultation once the person is ready to make such decisions. \n\nSo, while he might not be legally wrong, morally, he is in the wrong for not being honest and for making a life-changing financial decision without her input. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
