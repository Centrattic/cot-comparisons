We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. The situation is that the wife inherited money from her mother, and the husband used 40% of it to buy a new house in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, which he used to make the purchase.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The husband had legal authority given by the wife to handle the will and her mother's affairs. So, technically, he might have had the legal right to make decisions, but the question is more about morality and the relationship dynamics. Even if he had the legal power, using the inheritance for a personal purchase without discussing it with his wife could be a problem. The wife was grieving, and he acted on her instructions not to involve her in financial matters during that time. But does that mean he can make such a significant decision unilaterally?\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to buy a house in a certain market before the opportunity passed. He also mentions that the wife is more conservative financially, so she might not have agreed. But using someone else's inheritance without their knowledge is a big deal. Inheritance is typically a personal asset, and using it without consent, even if there's some legal authority, could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe husband plans to reveal the purchase eventually and check his wife's reaction. However, the fact that he didn't discuss it with her initially might be a problem. Even with the legal authority, the trust and communication in a marriage are important. The husband might have thought he was acting in the best interest, but the lack of transparency could lead to significant conflict. \n\nAlso, the part where he mentions using the money for a joint investment portfolio and the new property might not be entirely self-serving. But the main issue is the unauthorized use of the inheritance. In many places, inheritance is considered separate property, even in a marriage. So unless there's a specific agreement that the inheritance is to be used jointly, the husband might have overstepped. \n\nThe husband's justification is that he was avoiding burdening his wife during her grief, but that's not a substitute for informed consent. The wife might have wanted to use the inheritance differently, and the husband made a major financial decision on her behalf. This could be seen as a violation of her rights to her own inheritance. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if he had the legal authority, the ethical aspect of respecting his wife's autonomy and not making such a significant financial decision without her input is key. So while he might not be legally in the wrong, morally and in terms of relationship trust, he's likely at fault. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he used his wife's inheritance without her consent, despite having legal authority, which can't override the need for transparency and mutual agreement in a marriage.\n"
