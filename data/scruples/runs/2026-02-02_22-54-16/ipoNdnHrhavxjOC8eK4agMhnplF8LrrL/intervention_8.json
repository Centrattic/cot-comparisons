We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the husband who secretly spent his wife's inheritance is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife have been married for 20 years. They've lived in the same condo for 10 years, which has sentimental value. The husband wants to buy a new house now that their kid is grown. The wife is more conservative. Then, the wife inherited a large sum from her mother. The husband was given legal authority to handle the inheritance because she was grieving. He used 40% of it to buy a property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint investment portfolio. He kept it secret because she didn't want to deal with financial issues during her grief, and he saw a good investment opportunity.\n\nNow, the key points here. The wife gave him legal authority to sort through her mother's affairs. So, technically, he had the legal power to manage that inheritance. But the inheritance is her money, right? Even if he had authority, the inheritance is hers. So, using 40% without her knowledge might be a problem. The husband's reasoning is that he did it to take advantage of a market opportunity and to eventually benefit both of them. But he's keeping it a secret, planning to reveal it later to see her reaction.\n\nLegally, if he had power of attorney or legal authority, maybe he had the right to manage her affairs, but there's a difference between managing and spending. Also, in many jurisdictions, even with power of attorney, the agent must act in the best interest of the principal. So using the funds for a personal investment without her consent might not be in her best interest. Plus, the inheritance is separate property, especially if it's from her mother, so the husband using it without her consent could be considered a breach of trust.\n\nEthically, even if he had the legal authority, there's the aspect of transparency in a marriage. Major financial decisions involving a spouse's assets should be discussed. The husband's action might be seen as selfish because he made a decision that could affect their finances and future plans without her input. He also planned to keep it a secret, which is a red flag. Trust is important in a marriage, and this action could undermine that trust.\n\nThe husband's justification is that he did it to benefit both, but using her money without her knowledge is risky. What if the investment doesn't go well? She loses her inheritance. Also, the fact that he's keeping it a secret shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. Even if she was grieving, once she's ready, she has the right to know about decisions that affect her money. The husband might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate and made a significant financial decision on her behalf without her consent.\n"
