We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, the key points: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance without her knowledge. The wife had given him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He bought a house in Colorado, intending to use it as a future home or rental.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect. If he was legally authorized by his wife to manage the inheritance, then technically, he might have the right to make decisions with that money. However, the ethical side is different. Even if he had the authority, using a significant portion (40%) for a personal investment without her consent could be problematic. Inheritance is often considered personal property, and spouses might have different views on shared finances. Even if they're joint investors, using her inheritance without her input might be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThe husband's justification is that he didn't want to burden her during her grieving period. But this is a classic case of assuming that a decision is in her best interest without her input. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and financial decisions, especially large ones, typically require mutual agreement. Even if the wife had given him authority, there's a difference between managing affairs (like paying debts or taxes) and making a large investment. \n\nAlso, the husband's plan to surprise her might backfire if she feels her money was used without her knowledge. The fact that he's contemplating whether to tell her suggests he's aware of the potential wrongness. Ethically, transparency is important in a marriage, and financial decisions that affect both partners should be discussed. \n\nIn many places, inheritance is considered separate property unless the spouse chooses to commingle it. So legally, he might not be in the wrong if he acted within the authority given. But ethically, he's in a gray area because he didn't seek her input, which could strain their relationship. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on the balance between legal authority and ethical responsibility. The user is likely expecting an ethical judgment here rather than just a legal one. The husband's actions, while possibly legal, may still be considered wrong in the context of their marriage due to lack of transparency and mutual decision-making.\n"
