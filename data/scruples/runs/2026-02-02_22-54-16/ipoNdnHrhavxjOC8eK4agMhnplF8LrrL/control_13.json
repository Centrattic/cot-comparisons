We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. They used 40% of it to buy a new property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. The key points here are consent and transparency. \n\nFirst, the wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, including the inheritance. But he used a portion of it without her knowledge. Even though she was grieving and asked him to handle it, using her money without her consent is a big issue. Inheritances are typically considered separate property unless they're gifted to the marriage, so he might not have the right to use that money without her input.\n\nHe mentions that she was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial issues, but that doesn't mean he should have made such a significant decision on his own. Buying a $650k property is a major financial move. Even if he thought it was in their best interest, the lack of communication and transparency is problematic. The wife might have different priorities or concerns that he didn't consider. \n\nThe husband's plan to surprise her could backfire. If she finds out he spent her inheritance without her input, it could lead to trust issues. The fact that he's considering telling her is a positive step, but the act itself was done in secret. Financial decisions, especially involving someone else's inheritance, require mutual agreement. \n\nAlso, the legal aspect: depending on the jurisdiction, using inherited money for joint purchases without consent might not be legally sound. The wife might have a right to contest that. The husband might have overstepped his authority, even if he was given legal power to handle her mother's affairs. That power probably doesn't extend to personal financial decisions for the couple.\n\nSo putting it all together, the husband is in the wrong because he used his wife's money without her consent, which is a breach of trust and potentially illegal. The answer should be A.\n"
