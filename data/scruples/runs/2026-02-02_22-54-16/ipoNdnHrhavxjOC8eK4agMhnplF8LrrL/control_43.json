We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge. The wife was grieving and he had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Did he have the authority to use the inheritance? Since the wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs, maybe he had the power of attorney or something similar. But inheritance is typically the recipient's property. Even if he had the authority to manage the affairs, using a portion of the inheritance without her consent might be a problem. Inheritances are usually considered separate property, especially if the wife received them. So, even if she gave him authority to handle the will and affairs, using the money without her consent for a personal investment could be an issue. \n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. Even if he had the legal authority, using her money for a house without discussing it with her could be seen as a breach of trust. The husband's argument is that he did it to avoid burdening her during her grief. But that doesn't necessarily excuse using her money without her knowledge. The fact that he plans to involve her later by visiting the property monthly might not be enough. The key issue here is consent. The wife might not have wanted that portion of the inheritance to be used for a new home, especially a joint investment. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions that the wife is more conservative financially, so she might have had different plans for the inheritance. By using her funds without her input, he's making a financial decision that affects her, which is a significant matter. Even if he believes it's a good investment, the decision to spend a large portion of her inheritance is a major one that should be made together. \n\nSo, combining legal and ethical considerations, the husband probably acted without proper consent. Even if he had authority to manage the estate, the inheritance itself is her property, and using it without her explicit permission is likely wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
