We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been married for 20 years, with a 10-year-old condo they value sentimentally. The wife inherited a large sum from her mother, and the husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest into their joint portfolio.\n\nThe key points here are legal authority and trust. The husband had legal authority to handle the affairs, but using a significant portion of the inheritance without the wife's knowledge raises ethical questions. Even if he was authorized, the inheritance belongs to the wife, right? Unless there's a specific clause in the will that allows him to use it, but the post doesn't mention that. \n\nHe bought the property without her knowledge, which is a major financial decision. Marriages typically require transparency in big financial matters, especially when using a spouse's inheritance. The husband's reasoning is that he couldn't pass up the opportunity and didn't want to burden her during her grief. But even with good intentions, withholding such a significant purchase might be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe husband plans to reveal it gradually, which might not be the right approach. If he had to make a decision quickly, he should have communicated with her, even if she was grieving. The fact that he's considering using it as a rental or selling it if she doesn't like it suggests he's aware of the potential conflict. \n\nIn most jurisdictions, inheritance is considered separate property unless it's gifted to the spouse. So using her inheritance without her consent could be legally questionable. Even if he had legal authority to handle the affairs, the authority might not extend to spending her inheritance on a personal investment. \n\nEthically, the husband is in a tough spot. But secrets in a marriage, especially about such a large financial decision, are usually frowned upon. The wife might feel violated or disrespected, regardless of the husband's intentions. The husband's approach could damage their trust, which is crucial in a long-term relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong). Even with legal authority, using a spouse's inheritance without their knowledge for a personal investment, especially a significant one, is ethically and possibly legally problematic. The lack of transparency and the potential for financial strain on the wife's part are major issues here.\n"
