We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the wife received a large inheritance from her mother. She was grieving, and she gave the author legal authority to handle the will. He used 40% of it to buy a property in Colorado and the rest into their joint portfolio. The key points here are the legal authority and the context of her grief. \n\nHe mentions that he wanted to take advantage of a good investment opportunity in Colorado, which he had been looking at for a while. He didn't want to burden her with financial decisions during her grieving period. His intention was to later discuss it with her, maybe move there or rent it out. \n\nNow, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he had legal authority, which might mean he was allowed to make those decisions. On the other hand, using a significant portion of her inheritance without her direct consent afterward could be problematic. Even if she gave authority, maybe there's an expectation of transparency and discussion about such a large expenditure.\n\nInheritance is often considered personal, especially if it's from family. Even though it's now part of their joint finances (since they have a joint portfolio), the wife might have different views on how to use her inheritance. Spent without her knowledge could lead to mistrust. The author's reasoning is that he didn't want to add stress during her grieving, but making a major financial decision without her input might have long-term consequences.\n\nAlso, the author plans to visit the property monthly to see her reaction. This suggests he's aware of the potential issue and is trying to gauge her feelings. But is that enough? The ethical aspect here is about trust and communication. Even if he had authority, using a large chunk of her inheritance for a personal investment might be seen as overstepping, especially if the money could have been used differently based on her wishes.\n\nI think there's a line between financial management and respecting personal boundaries. While he had authority, the scale of the decision (40% of inheritance) is significant. Maybe he should have discussed it with her once she was ready, even if she didn't want to deal with it while grieving. The fact that he's now considering telling her shows he's aware of the potential problem.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, I believe the author is in the wrong because he made a major financial decision without her knowledge, even if he had some legal authority. Trust in a marriage often requires transparency, especially with such a large sum of her inheritance. The potential for harm to their relationship is high if she doesn't agree with how the money was spent.\n"
