We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using his wife's inheritance. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs during her grieving period. He didn't tell her because he thought she didn't want to deal with financial issues at the time. Now he's considering whether to tell her and is seeking opinions.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the husband overstepped by using the inheritance without her explicit consent. Inheritance is typically considered separate property, but if it's received by the wife and held in a joint account or used in the marriage, it might become part of the marital assets. However, here the wife gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. But does that authority include spending the inheritance?\n\nLegal authority to settle affairs might cover things like funeral costs, paying debts, or managing the estate, but using a significant portion of the inheritance for a personal investment (buying a house) might be beyond that scope. Even if he had legal authority, ethically, using someone else's inheritance without their consent is questionable. The wife might have intended that money for other purposes, like her own use or other family needs.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he didn't want to burden her during her grief. But that's a bit of a slippery slope. Even if she was grieving, making decisions about her money without her input could be seen as disrespectful. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and this action might erode that trust. \n\nHe also mentions that the new property could be a rental or sold if she doesn't like it. That shows he's considering alternatives, but the initial act of spending without consent is the problem. Even if the intention is good, the method is questionable. \n\nFinancial decisions in a marriage should involve both partners, especially when dealing with large sums like inheritance. The husband might have acted out of his own desires, assuming he knew what was best, but that's not how shared financial responsibility works. \n\nSo, even if he had some authority, using the inheritance without her knowledge and without her agreement is likely wrong. The ethical and relational aspects point towards the husband being in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
