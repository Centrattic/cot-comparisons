We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. The inheritance came from her mother's will, and he had legal authority to handle her affairs because she was grieving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. He was given legal authority to manage her affairs, which might mean he has the power to make financial decisions on her behalf. But does that include using her inheritance for a joint investment? Inheritances are generally considered separate property unless they're commingled. If he used her money for a joint investment, that might be problematic.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Even if he had the legal authority, using someone else's money without their consent, especially a spouse, could be seen as a breach of trust. The wife might expect that her inheritance is her own to manage or spend as she wishes. The husband decided to use a significant portion for their mutual benefit, but without her input. Even if he thought she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving, she might still expect transparency.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he couldn't pass up the investment opportunity, but that's a financial decision that affects her as a spouse. Marital trust and communication are key here. Using the money without her knowledge could lead to resentment, even if the intention was to benefit both of them. Also, the fact that he plans to visit the property monthly to gauge her reaction implies he knows she might not be okay with it, which shows he's aware of the potential issue.\n\nAnother point is the use of the term \"secretly.\" Even if he had legal authority, the secrecy adds to the ethical problem. The wife might feel that her autonomy over her inheritance was violated. Inheritances are personal, and unless there's a prior agreement, using them without consent could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, even if legally he might have had some authority, ethically he's in a bad spot. The wife's consent and her right to decide how her inheritance is used are important. The husband's actions, while maybe well-intentioned, lack the transparency and mutual agreement that a marriage typically requires in major financial decisions.\n"
