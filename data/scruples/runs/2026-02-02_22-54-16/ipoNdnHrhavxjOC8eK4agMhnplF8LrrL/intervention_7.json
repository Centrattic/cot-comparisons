We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and his wife have been married for 20 years. They live in a condo they've had for 10 years, which has sentimental value. He's considering buying a new house now that their kid is gone and they're financially more stable. The wife received a large inheritance from her mother, who recently passed. He was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs while she was grieving. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. He did this without telling her because she didn't want to deal with financial stuff while grieving. Now he's planning to visit the new property monthly to see if she's okay with moving there or using it as a rental.\n\nFirst, legal authority: If he was given legal authority, that's a key point. If it's a power of attorney or similar, he might have the legal right to make decisions. But does legal authority cover spending someone else's inheritance? Inheritances are typically considered the recipient's personal property unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. Even with legal authority, spending someone else's money might still be a legal issue unless the authority explicitly allows that. Maybe the wife gave him power of attorney specifically for handling her mother's affairs, but that might not cover using the inheritance funds for other purchases. He might be overstepping his authority here.\n\nEthically, even if he had legal authority, using her inheritance without her consent is a big deal. Inheritances are often considered personal, especially in marriages where separate assets are involved. Unless they have a prenuptial agreement or some other arrangement, the inheritance is hers. Using it for a joint purchase without her knowledge is a breach of trust, regardless of the reason. The fact that he used part for a new property and part for their joint portfolio complicates things. The joint portfolio part might not be as bad since it's shared, but using her inheritance for a property in Colorado without her input is a problem.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he couldn't pass up the opportunity and she was grieving. But that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. He should have discussed it with her once she was ready, even if she didn't want to deal with it immediately. The plan to visit the property monthly to see her reaction is an attempt to address this, but it's still a secret action. The surprise element is a risk because if she's not okay with it, it could cause significant conflict.\n\nAlso, the new property might appreciate, but that doesn't justify the secrecy. Transparency in financial decisions is crucial in a marriage. Even if his intentions are good, the lack of communication is a major issue. The sentiment about wanting to use the condo for their kid is part of the motivation, but that doesn't directly relate to using her inheritance for a new purchase.\n\nIn summary, while the legal authority might give him some leeway, the ethical and emotional aspects of using her inheritance without her knowledge are problematic. The author likely acted inconsiderately, even if he had good intentions. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
