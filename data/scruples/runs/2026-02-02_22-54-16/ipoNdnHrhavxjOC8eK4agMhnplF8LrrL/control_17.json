We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly spending their wife's inheritance. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, they've been married for 20 years and live in a condo with sentimental value. The husband wants to buy a new house now that their kid is gone and they have more financial freedom. The wife is more conservative with finances. Then, the wife receives a large inheritance from her mother's will. While she's grieving, the husband was given legal authority to handle her mother's affairs. He used 40% of the inheritance to buy a property in Colorado and put the rest into their joint investments. He did this without her knowledge because he didn't want to burden her during her grieving period. His plan is to check in with her monthly to see her reaction.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did he have the right to use her inheritance without her knowledge? The wife gave him legal authority to handle the will, but did that include spending the money? Also, the husband's reasoning was that she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving. But even if she gave him legal authority, using 40% for a personal investment without her consent could be problematic. Inheritances are often considered separate property, especially if the wife is the sole heir. Unless there was a prenuptial agreement or specific terms in the will stating that the money should be used jointly, the husband might have overstepped by using it without her input. \n\nAdditionally, even if he had the authority to manage the affairs, using a significant portion of the inheritance for a personal purchase (like a new home) without discussing it with his wife could be seen as a breach of trust. Marital trust and communication are important, and making such a large financial decision unilaterally, even with good intentions, could be considered wrong. The husband's justification that he wanted to protect her from financial stress during grieving might not excuse the lack of transparency. \n\nAlso, the husband's plan to \"surprise\" her might backfire if she finds out he used her inheritance without her knowledge. Even if the property appreciates, the ethical issue is about consent and mutual decision-making in a marriage. Unless the will explicitly gave him the power to use the inheritance as he saw fit, he might be in the wrong by assuming he could make such a decision alone. \n\nIn many legal systems, inheritance is considered the individual's property unless it's commingled with marital assets. So using 40% of her inheritance for a joint investment or a personal purchase without her consent could be legally and ethically questionable. The husband didn't mention consulting with her about the use of the funds, even though she had entrusted him to handle the will. However, handling the will's implications might not equate to giving him the right to spend the money on a new property. \n\nTherefore, the husband likely acted inconsiderate of his wife's wishes and the nature of the inheritance. Even if his intentions were good, the lack of transparency and the significant financial decision without her input makes it seem like he is in the wrong.\n"
