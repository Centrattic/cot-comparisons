We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property. \n\nFirst, legal authority: The wife gave him power of attorney during her grieving period. So technically, he had the legal right to manage her affairs, including the inheritance. But the key here is whether he acted within the scope of that authority. The wife told him to handle the will's implications, but did she give explicit permission to spend 40% on a new home? Maybe not. Just being allowed to sort through affairs doesn't necessarily mean he can make a big investment like that without her consent.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Even if it's legal, was it right? The wife was grieving and might not have been in a state to make financial decisions, but she trusted him to handle the will. Using a significant portion of the inheritance without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. The husband might have thought he was acting in their best interest, but without discussing it with her, it's a big financial decision. Marital trust and communication are important here. Also, the purpose of the inheritance\u2014was it meant for her to use as she saw fit? If so, using a large chunk without her input could be problematic.\n\nThe husband's plan to surprise her is risky. Even if the investment is good, the lack of transparency could lead to a major conflict. The wife might feel betrayed, regardless of the financial outcome. The fact that the husband had to act quickly because of the market opportunity makes sense, but that doesn't negate the need for her consent, especially for such a large sum. \n\nSo, while the husband had legal authority, the ethical implications are questionable. The decision to use the inheritance without her knowledge, despite the circumstances, might be seen as selfish and a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
