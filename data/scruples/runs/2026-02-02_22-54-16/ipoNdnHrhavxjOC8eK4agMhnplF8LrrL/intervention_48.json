We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. The wife was grieving, and he had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The husband had legal authority given by the wife to sort through her mother's affairs. But using 40% of the inheritance for a personal investment might be questionable. Even with authority, does that mean he can spend the money as he likes? Inheritances are typically considered the recipient's personal property unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. So the wife's inheritance is her money, and unless the husband had explicit permission to use it for a house purchase, he might have overstepped.\n\nNext, the marital aspect. The husband and wife have been married for 20 years, but they have different financial mindsets. The husband made a major financial decision without consulting the wife. Even if he thought she was too emotional to handle it during her grief, big purchases like a house usually require mutual agreement. The husband's action could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since they are a joint household. Financial decisions, particularly large ones, are usually considered joint decisions in a marriage, even if the funds are separate.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he wanted to take advantage of a good opportunity and that the investment could benefit both. However, the key issue here is the lack of communication. The wife might have different priorities for her inheritance. Even if the husband had her best interests at heart, he didn't give her a chance to decide. The fact that he plans to \"test the waters\" by visiting once a month and see her reaction doesn't change the fact that he acted unilaterally. That could lead to resentment and a breakdown of trust.\n\nAlso, using the legal authority given for handling affairs to make a personal investment might be a misuse of that authority. The wife gave him power to manage the will's implications, which likely refers to settling the estate, not using the funds for his own purposes. There's a difference between managing the inheritance and spending it without consent.\n\nIn terms of potential consequences, if the wife finds out and is upset, the husband could be held legally liable for misusing her funds. Even if there's no legal claim, the emotional damage to the marriage is significant. The husband's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, lacks transparency and respect for the wife's autonomy over her inheritance.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the husband is in the wrong. He used his wife's money without her consent for a personal investment, which is a breach of trust and possibly a legal issue. The answer should be A.\n"
