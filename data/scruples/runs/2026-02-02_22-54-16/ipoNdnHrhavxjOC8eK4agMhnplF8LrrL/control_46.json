We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for secretly using their wife's inheritance to buy a new property without her knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are that the husband had legal authority from his wife to handle her mother's affairs, which included the inheritance. He used 40% of it to buy a house in Colorado and put the rest in their joint portfolio. The wife was grieving and didn't want to deal with financial matters, so she gave him this authority.\n\nNow, the main question here is about the ethical and legal implications. Legally, if he had the authority granted by the wife, then using the funds as instructed might be okay. But wait, the wife gave him authority to handle the affairs, which might include the will, but does that mean she explicitly gave permission to spend the inheritance? It's possible that the authority was to manage the affairs, not necessarily to disburse the funds. So there's a possible legal ambiguity here.\n\nEthically, even if he had some authority, the key issue is deception. The husband didn't tell his wife about this purchase. The wife was already grieving and didn't want to deal with financial issues, so he took advantage of that. Using her inheritance without her knowledge, even if with good intentions, is a breach of trust. In a marriage, both partners typically expect transparency, especially with large financial decisions. The husband's reasoning is that he wanted to surprise her, but this could come off as disrespectful to her wishes and financial autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is the use of the inheritance. The wife might have had her own plans for that money, and the husband's decision to use part of it for a personal investment (even if he sees it as a benefit for both) could be seen as overstepping. Even if the investment is sound, the lack of communication is a problem. The husband's plan to tell her later isn't enough; the secrecy is the issue.\n\nAlso, considering that the husband is using the wife's inheritance (which she received as an only child from her mother) to make a major life decision without her input undermines her control over her own money. Even if it's a joint portfolio, the inheritance itself is her personal asset, and using it for a purchase without her consent is problematic.\n\nSo, legally there might be a gray area depending on the exact terms of the authority he was given, but ethically, the husband is definitely in the wrong. The secrecy and lack of communication are significant issues. Trust in a marriage requires transparency, and making such a large financial decision unilaterally, especially with someone else's money, is a breach of that trust.\n"
