We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband used 40% of his wife's inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without her knowledge. He had legal authority to handle her mother's affairs during her grieving period. He wants to surprise her and see how she feels.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The husband was given legal authority to manage the inheritance, so he had the power to make those decisions. But even if he had the legal right, does that mean it's morally right? The wife was grieving and might not have been in the best state to handle financial matters. He might have thought he was helping by handling the inheritance, but using a significant portion without her consent could be an issue.\n\nSentimentally, the wife's property has strong sentimental value. The husband mentions they raised their kid there, so maybe she feels attached to it. But the new property purchase isn't about the condo they live in; it's a separate property. However, the fact that he didn't consult her about a major financial decision is a red flag. Even if she was grieving, major purchases should be discussed, especially when using her inheritance. Trust is important in a marriage, and keeping something like this secret might harm that trust.\n\nAlso, the husband's plan to visit the property monthly to see her reaction could be seen as manipulative. He's not being transparent upfront, which might lead to resentment later. The wife might feel that her inheritance was used without her knowledge, even if it was for their benefit. The question is whether the husband's actions, though legal, were respectful and considerate of his wife's wishes and the nature of the inheritance.\n\nInheritances can be a sensitive topic. Depending on how the wife views the inheritance, she might consider it her personal asset. Using it without her input could be a breach of trust. The husband's justification is that she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving, but that's a temporary state. Maybe she would have wanted to make the decision together once she was ready.\n\nSo even though he had the legal authority, the moral and relational aspects suggest that he might be in the wrong. The key points are lack of transparency, using a significant portion of her inheritance, and the potential to cause hurt or betrayal in the marriage.\n"
