We have been living in the same condo for about 10 of those years. We raised our kid in this place and it has a strong sentimental value. I never plan on leasing it out to anyone else because it could be used for our kid someday if he ever needs a place to stay. I have gotten to the point in my career where buying a new house sounds possible. Also, now that the kid is gone, financially I have been freed up a bit. My wife unfortunately does not have the same mindset as she is much more conservative.\n\nMy wife also just coincidentally ran into a large inheritance as her mother just passed away and she was an only child. Anyways while she was grieving I told her that I would take care of the implications of the will and she gave me the legal authority to sort through her mother\u2019s affairs. With this authority, used about 40% to buy a new property in Colorado (\\~$650k) and put the rest in our joint investment portfolio. The reason I had to buy it without her knowledge is because she did not want to deal with any financial issues while grieving (per her instructions) and I have had my eye on this market for a while\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t walk away from the opportunity once I found out about it.\n\nMy plan is to visit it once a month and see how she feels about it. This will clearly benefit both of our lives, but I have a sinking feeling that I need to tell her and that I am selfish. If she likes it, surprise (\u2026 *yay!*) we will move in. If not, well, I could use it as a rental property or resell it (I believe that it has already appreciated). Anyways, looking for your feedback on this Reddit.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for secretly spending his wife's inheritance. The situation involves the husband using 40% of her inheritance to buy a new property in Colorado without telling her. The wife was grieving and gave him legal authority to handle her mother's affairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband had legal authority to manage the inheritance, which might mean he had some power of attorney. But does that include the right to spend a large portion of it without her consent? Even if she gave him authority, the inheritance is her money, and using 40% without her knowledge seems like a big deal. He mentions he did it because she didn't want to deal with financial issues while grieving, but is it his decision to make?\n\nAlso, the intent here is important. He bought a property he liked, thinking it could benefit them both, but he's keeping it secret. Even if the plan is to let her decide later, withholding such a significant financial decision without her input could be problematic. There's a trust issue here. If he's using her money for a joint investment without her knowledge, that might be seen as violating her trust, even if he had the legal authority.\n\nLegal authority might allow him to make decisions, but it's not a substitute for communication and mutual agreement, especially in a marriage. Marital assets and decisions usually require both partners' consent. Even if he had the power of attorney, the inheritance is her money, so using a portion without her explicit permission, especially for something like a new home, is a breach of trust and transparency.\n\nMoreover, the husband's reasoning that he couldn't walk away from the opportunity might not justify the secrecy. He should have discussed it with her once she was ready, even if she was grieving. Trust in a marriage is built on honesty, and keeping such a large financial action hidden could lead to serious consequences, like divorce or legal disputes.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if he had legal authority, the ethical aspect of transparency in a marriage is crucial. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
