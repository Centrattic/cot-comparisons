I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a series of pranks between the siblings and the subsequent fallout.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that they previously pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox. The sister then retaliated by exposing his collection of adult manga to the family in front of his visiting girlfriend. The author now wants to cut off their sister, arguing that she crossed a line. They're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nI need to evaluate both sides. The initial prank by the author was meant as a joke but resulted in the sister crying, which is a strong emotional reaction. The sister's retaliation was more severe, involving exposing personal and sensitive items in front of others. The author feels humiliated and cut off the sister as a result.\n\nThe key points are the escalation of pranks. The author's prank led to emotional harm, and the sister's retaliation caused significant personal embarrassment. The author is now cutting off communication, which is a serious step. The question is whether the author's actions (cutting off the sister) are justified.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about proportionality. The sister's prank was more invasive and damaging, so the author might feel justified in cutting off contact. However, cutting off a family member is a major action. But given the sister's breach of privacy and the lasting impact on the author's family and personal life, the author's response could be seen as a reaction to a severe violation rather than just a prank.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because the sister's actions were more harmful and invasive. The author's prank, while hurtful, didn't have the same level of lasting impact. Therefore, the author's decision to cut off the sister could be seen as a reasonable response to the more severe violation.\n"
