I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of a Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings where the author previously pranked their sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl the author had over. The author is upset and has decided to stop communication with their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the key points. The initial prank by the author (fake Xbox with a brick) led to the sister crying. The sister then took a more severe action by revealing the author's private collection, which caused significant embarrassment. The author is now cutting off the sister and wants to know if they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn analyzing this, the initial prank was a joke, but it had a negative impact on the sister. The sister's retaliation was more harmful, leading to public humiliation in front of family and the girl. The author's response is to cut off the sister, which is a serious action. \n\nThe moral aspect here involves whether the author's initial prank was harmless and whether the sister's revenge was proportionate. The author might argue that the sister escalated the situation beyond a typical prank, but the act of cutting off communication is a form of punishment. \n\nHowever, the sister's action was a significant breach of privacy and caused lasting damage to the author's reputation within the family. The author's response could be seen as a way to enforce boundaries after being wronged. \n\nBut wait, the author also initiated the prank. Did they cross a line first? The sister's act was worse, but the author's decision to cut off the sister for retaliation might be justified if they feel the sister broke the rules of their prank war. \n\nOn the other hand, cutting off a sibling over a prank, even a severe one, might be seen as harsh. Siblings often have conflicts, but the long-term impact of cutting someone off is significant. The author should consider if there's a way to address the issue without ending the relationship. \n\nBut the sister's action was exposing private, sensitive material in front of others, which is a major violation. The author's embarrassment and the family's reaction (mom asking to sell them, uncle's comments) indicate serious consequences. \n\nSo, the author's initial prank was a mistake, but the sister's response was even worse. The author cutting off the sister is a reaction to a more severe transgression. In this case, the author is not the asshole because the sister overstepped, and the author is setting a boundary in response. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
