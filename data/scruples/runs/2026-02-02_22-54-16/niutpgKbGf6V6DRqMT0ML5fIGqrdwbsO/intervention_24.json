I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about pranks and a fallout between siblings.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox that was actually an empty box with a brick. That made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by taking his secret adult manga collection and showing it to the family in front of his girl. The author now cut off his sister because he finds this extremely humiliating. He's asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for cutting her off, and whether her prank was worse than his.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author did initiate the prank first, which led to his sister crying. That's a bit harsh, but maybe it was a joke that went too far. Then the sister took the opportunity to get back at him by exposing his private collection. The author's defense is that he pranked her first, but the question is whether his response (cutting her off) is justified.\n\nThe key here is the escalation. The initial prank (Xbox with a brick) caused emotional harm. The sister's revenge, while crossing a line by exposing his private stuff, might be seen as a proportionate response in terms of pranking. However, the author is now cutting off his sister, which is a more severe punishment than the sister's prank. The sister's action might have been wrong, but cutting off communication completely could be excessive. Also, the author might have a responsibility to de-escalate the situation instead of doubling down, especially if the sister was just retaliating. The author's argument is that he's not the asshole because he was pranked first, but the sister's action had real consequences, damaging his reputation with the family. The question is whether the prank itself was the issue or the retaliation. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person who escalates the conflict is often considered the asshole. The author's sister took a private matter into a public family setting, which is a bigger issue. But the author's response of cutting her off might be seen as harsh, especially if the sister was just getting back at him for the initial prank. The author's first prank was wrong in making her cry, and the sister's response was worse in terms of public humiliation. However, cutting off the sister entirely might be a disproportionate reaction. The author could have addressed the issue without fully severing the relationship. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's cutting off his sister over a prank that, while hurtful, doesn't necessarily warrant a complete communication cutoff. The sister's actions were more severe, but the author's retaliation is also extreme. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
