I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a prank war between the siblings. The author first pranked his sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then, in retaliation, the sister exposed his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he was seeing, causing him embarrassment and leading to family tension.\n\nThe author is now cutting off his sister, considering she went too far. The question is whether he's justified in doing so. \n\nFirst, the initial prank (fake Xbox) was a joke that had emotional consequences, making her cry. That's not great, but maybe it's a common prank between siblings. However, the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection in front of family. That's a significant invasion of privacy and could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe author feels it's justified to cut her off because she escalated the prank war to a point that caused public humiliation and family issues. The sister's actions had lasting negative effects, while the author's prank, while hurtful, didn't have the same level of consequence. \n\nConsidering the principle of fairness in sibling pranks, the sister's action seems more harmful. The author's response of cutting her off is a form of self-defense to protect his privacy and standing in the family. The prank war started with the author, but the sister escalated it beyond a playful level. \n\nHowever, cutting off a sibling entirely might be too harsh. But given the situation, the author might feel that's the only way to prevent further harm. The key is whether the sister's action was a proportionate response. Since exposing private items in front of family is a major breach, the author's reaction could be seen as justified. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
