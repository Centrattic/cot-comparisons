I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings, starting with the author giving their sister an empty Xbox box. The sister then retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection in front of family and a girl he's seeing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's initial prank made their sister cry, which is pretty harsh. Then the sister's revenge was exposing his private collection. The author is now cutting off contact, and the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial prank and the retaliation. The author's prank led to emotional harm (crying), and the sister's retaliation caused significant embarrassment and family issues. The author is justifying cutting off the sister as a consequence, but is that justified?\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, pranks can be a gray area. If the pranks are harmless, maybe they're just sibling rivalry. But when they cause emotional distress or humiliation, it's more problematic. The author's initial prank made the sister cry, which is a red flag. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing private items, which is a big invasion of privacy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for cutting off the sister? Well, the sister's action was definitely crossing a line. However, the author's initial prank also contributed to escalating the conflict. If the author had apologized for the first prank, maybe the sister wouldn't have retaliated so harshly. But the sister's response was extreme regardless. The author's response of cutting off contact could be seen as a consequence for the sister's actions. But is it the author's fault for instigating the prank war?\n\nThe line between playful teasing and harmful behavior is important here. The sister's action was more harmful, as it caused lasting damage in the family. The author is protecting their privacy and reputation, which is understandable. However, the author's initial prank was also harmful. It's a cycle of retaliation. But the final act of cutting off the sister is the author's response to the sister's overstepping.\n\nIn terms of who is more in the wrong, the sister's action was worse, but the author did start the prank war. However, the sister escalated it beyond a simple prank. The author cutting off contact is a consequence, but is that justified? The author might feel wronged, but the sister's action was the final straw. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for cutting off the sister, but both have some responsibility for the escalating pranks. But the question is specifically about the author cutting off the sister. Since the sister's action was more severe and invasive, the author's response seems justified, so the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
