I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The author first pranked his sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit. He's upset and cut her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial prank. The author gave his sister a brick in an Xbox box, which led to her crying. That seems harsh, maybe even cruel. Pranks should be good-natured, but if someone ends up crying, it's a sign the joke went too far. The sister's crying indicates that the prank was hurtful, so the author might be partly at fault here.\n\nThen, the sister's revenge. She took the author's adult magazines and showed them to the family. The author mentions these are Japanese manga with risqu\u00e9 content, not Playboy. He also says his mom was against him having them because of younger siblings. The sister's action was a direct retaliation, but exposing private things in front of family is also a big step. It's understandable why he's upset, but is her action justified? She might have thought it was a fair revenge, but it's a severe escalation.\n\nThe author is now cutting off his sister. He's upset and feels humiliated. The question is whether he's the asshole. The key points are the initial prank causing emotional harm and the sister's revenge leading to public humiliation. The author's prank was more directly harmful emotionally, while the sister's was more about public embarrassment. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. The author's initial prank caused his sister to cry, which is a red flag. The sister's prank, while embarrassing, might be a reaction to the first prank. However, exposing someone's private collection is a serious invasion of privacy. The author's decision to cut her off is a reaction to her action, but considering he started the prank war with a harmful prank, maybe he's partially at fault.\n\nThe Reddit community often looks at intent and proportionality. If the author's prank was mean-spirited and caused crying, that's a problem. The sister's response, while harsh, might be seen as over the line, but the user is asking if he's wrong for cutting her off. The user is the one who initiated the harmful prank first. The sister's action was a retaliation, but maybe the author's initial prank was worse. However, both have done something wrong.\n\nIn the end, the author might not be the asshole because the sister's action was more damaging in terms of family reputation and his social standing. But his initial prank was hurtful. However, since he's cutting her off because of her action, he's justified in feeling wronged. The answer might be B (No), because the sister's action was more severe and the author's initial prank was a trigger, but he's reacting to her overstepping. However, some might argue that both are at fault. But the key is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the sister crossed a line, maybe the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
