I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. The situation involves some back-and-forth pranks between siblings.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox box with a brick inside, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's dating. The author now thinks cutting her off is justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are the nature of the pranks and the escalation. The first prank involved making someone cry, which is pretty harsh. The sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection, which is a significant invasion of privacy and caused public humiliation. \n\nNow, the author is cutting off the sister. The question is whether this is justified. The author feels wronged because the sister crossed a line. On the other hand, the author's initial prank also hurt the sister. \n\nBut the sister's prank was more severe in terms of consequences. The author had a right to privacy, and the sister's action led to family disapproval and personal embarrassment. The author cutting off the sister could be seen as a reaction to the more serious prank. However, cutting off a family member entirely might be seen as extreme, but considering the context, maybe it's a reasonable response. \n\nThe key is whether the author's actions are proportionate. The first prank was harmful, but the sister's response was more damaging. The author might not be in the wrong here for cutting her off after such a betrayal. The sister's prank was intentional and caused lasting damage, so the author's decision to stop communication could be justified. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The sister's prank was more severe, and the author's reaction is a response to a significant breach of trust and privacy.\n"
