I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister with an Xbox box that had a brick inside, which made her cry. The sister then retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection in front of family and a girl he was seeing. The author is now cutting off the sister and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the initial prank (Xbox box) was on the author. The sister's revenge involved exposing his personal items, which led to significant embarrassment. The question is whether cutting off contact is justified here.\n\nFrom a general perspective, pranks can be seen as harmless, but when they cross into making someone cry, it's more problematic. The sister's retaliation was pretty harsh, exposing private items in front of family. The author felt humiliated, leading them to cut off the sister.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but they want a second opinion. The key points are the escalating pranks and the severity of the retaliation. The sister's action was intentional and caused significant harm to the author's reputation and family relations. The author's decision to cut off contact is a response to this betrayal. \n\nHowever, it's important to consider if the author's initial prank was also hurtful. If the first prank was inappropriate (making her cry), then both sides have issues. But given the sister's response was so severe, the author's cutoff might be justified. \n\nIn the Reddit community, the consensus often considers the intent and the impact. The sister's action was more malicious and harmful, so the author might not be in the wrong for cutting her off. The answer is likely B (Not the asshole).\n"
