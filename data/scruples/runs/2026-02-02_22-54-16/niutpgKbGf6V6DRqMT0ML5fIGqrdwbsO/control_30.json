I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation started with an Xbox prank that made the sister cry. Then the author's sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he's with. He's cut off the sister and feels justified, but is he the asshole?\n\nFirst, the initial prank: the author gave his sister a brick in an Xbox box. That's a common prank, but it's cruel if it made her cry. Pranks can be harmless, but when they cause emotional harm, especially to family, it's problematic. So, the author might have been inconsiderate there.\n\nNow, the sister's retaliation. She took his adult magazines and showed them to the family and the girl. Those are private items, and exposing them was a serious breach of privacy. The author might have felt that was crossing a line, especially since it affected his relationships and caused family embarrassment. But then the author started the prank war with something that hurt his sister emotionally. \n\nThe key here is whether both parties are equally at fault. The sister escalated the pranks from a joke to something that invaded the author's privacy in a damaging way. However, the author initiated the conflict with a prank that caused distress. So, is it mutual, or does the sister's action make him the asshole?\n\nThe author is cutting off the sister. If the sister's prank was a harsh retaliation for a prank that was already hurtful, maybe the author's reaction is disproportionate. But if the sister's action was an overstep, then the author isn't wrong for cutting her off. \n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. The author's original prank was mean, but the sister took it to a more harmful level. However, cutting off a family member is a serious consequence. The author could have tried to apologize for the initial prank and addressed the situation with his sister instead of escalating it. But the sister's action was also intentional and harmful. \n\nSo, maybe the author is at least partially in the wrong for starting it. But the sister's action was worse. The problem is whether the author's retaliation of cutting her off is justified. Since family relationships are important, cutting off a sister over this might be too harsh, but if the sister's prank was a deliberate attack on his privacy and dignity, then maybe the author had a reason. \n\nIt's complicated. The initial prank was bad, but the sister's response was worse. The author is now cutting her off, which is a big step. The answer might lean on whether both pranks are on the same level. The sister's action involved exposing private items, which is more severe. But the author's initial prank led to her revenge. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author initiated the prank that caused emotional harm, so he's at least some of the problem. However, the sister's retaliation was also extreme. The question is if the author is the asshole for cutting her off. If both took things too far, maybe it's a mutual situation. But the author is the one who's cutting off their sister now. \n\nHmm. The original prank was bad, but the sister's response was worse. However, cutting off a family member is a significant action. So, the author's response might be seen as overreacting, especially if he started the conflict. But if the sister's prank was truly crossing a line, then maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nI think the answer is a mix. The author is partly at fault for the initial prank, but the sister's retaliation was worse. However, cutting off a sibling is a harsh punishment, so maybe the author is the asshole here. But the sister's action was more malicious. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. The sister's prank was worse, but the author's initial prank started it. The author might have a right to feel wronged, but cutting her off could be seen as a form of punishment. If the author's actions were intentional and the sister's retaliation was in response, maybe it's a mutual situation. But the sister's prank was more harmful. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being entirely in the wrong because the sister's action was a significant overstep. But the initial prank was also inconsiderate. However, the main issue is the sister's exposure of private items, which is a bigger problem. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure.\n"
