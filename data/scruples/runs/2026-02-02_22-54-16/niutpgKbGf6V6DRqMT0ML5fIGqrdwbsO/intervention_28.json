I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them by exposing their adult magazines. The author had previously pranked the sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and sister have a history of pranks. The author's prank led to the sister crying, which is a strong emotional reaction. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga to the family in front of a girl he's interested in. The author is now cutting off the sister, feeling it was a betrayal that crossed a line.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks and the emotional impact. The initial prank (fake Xbox) was bad enough to make the sister cry. The sister's retaliation is more severe, as it involved exposing private items that the author was trying to keep hidden. The exposure led to family reactions, the girl mocking the author, and the author feeling humiliated. \n\nThe author is asking if cutting off the sister makes them the asshole. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants an opinion. \n\nNow, considering social norms and ethics: pranks are usually meant to be light-hearted, but when they cause emotional harm, they cross a line. The sister's prank was more harmful because it involved privacy invasion and led to public humiliation. The author's reaction is to cut off the sister, which is a consequence of the prank. \n\nBut is cutting off the sister justified? The author might feel wronged, but cutting off family can be a drastic step. However, given the sister's actions were more severe and intentional in causing harm, the author's response could be seen as self-defense. \n\nHowever, the author also initiated the prank with the fake Xbox. But that prank was less severe. The sister's retaliation was disproportionate. The author is now ending the relationship, which is a personal choice. In terms of right or wrong, the sister's actions were worse. The author's response is a reaction to that. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because the sister escalated the prank to a harmful level, and the author is protecting their own dignity and family relationships. The prank war started with the author, but the sister's action was more damaging. Therefore, cutting off the sister is a reasonable response given the circumstances.\n"
