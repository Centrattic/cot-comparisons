I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank situation. \n\nFirst, the context: The author previously pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox with a brick, which made her cry. The sister then took revenge by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he was seeing. The author is now cutting off the sister and wonders if he's the asshole.\n\nI need to evaluate both sides. The initial prank by the author led to emotional harm (the sister cried). Then, the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection, which is a significant invasion of privacy and caused public humiliation. The author is cutting her off, which is a response to the sister's action.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's action seems worse because it involved exposing personal belongings and causing embarrassment in front of family and a friend. The author's initial prank was a prank, but it caused harm. However, the sister's revenge escalated it. The author's response is cutting off the sister, which is a personal choice but not necessarily an asshole move. The key is whether the author's actions (cutting off) are justified given the sister's escalation. The initial prank was a mistake, but the sister's action was more severe. So the author's retaliation in cutting off is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
