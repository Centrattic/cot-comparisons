I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. The author now thinks the sister went too far and has cut her off, but is wondering if they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's prank made the sister cry, which is pretty harsh. Then the sister's revenge was exposing his private stuff in front of the family and a potential romantic interest. The author's response was cutting off the sister. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the initial prank. Giving someone an empty box with a brick as a prank... that's not a typical prank. It's more like a prank that can cause emotional harm. Making someone cry is not a light consequence. So the author's prank was likely excessive or mean-spirited, especially because it led to the sister crying. That's a red flag.\n\nThen the sister's retaliation. She took the author's private collection and exposed it to the family in front of a girl he was seeing. That's definitely a serious violation of privacy. The author's collection, even if they're into things like adult manga, is their private property. By exposing that, the sister caused significant embarrassment and possibly damaged the author's relationship with the family and the girl. That seems like a major overstep.\n\nThe author then decides to cut off the sister. The question is whether this is justified. The author's argument is that the sister's actions were worse than the initial prank, so cutting her off is warranted. The sister's argument (if she were to respond) might be that the author's initial prank was worse, so she was just retaliating. \n\nBut in terms of social norms and what's considered acceptable, pranks that cause emotional harm (like making someone cry) are generally frowned upon. However, retaliating with a violation of privacy and exposing someone's private materials is also a serious offense. \n\nThe author is now cutting off the sister. The question is if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions (initial prank) led to the sister's retaliation. But the sister's response was arguably worse. However, cutting off a family member is a significant action. The author might be justified in feeling that the sister's actions were beyond a reasonable retaliation, but is cutting off completely the right move?\n\nIn terms of \"Am I the Asshole\" standards, the subreddit often looks at who crossed a line first and the severity of the actions. The author's initial prank was harmful (made the sister cry), then the sister's retaliation was even more harmful (exposing private materials). The author cutting off the sister could be seen as a response to the sister's overstep, but the author's initial action was also problematic. However, the sister's actions were arguably worse, so maybe the author isn't the asshole here. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's own actions. If the author's prank was the reason the sister wanted revenge, then the author's initial action set off the chain of events. But the sister's response was extreme. The author is now cutting off the sister for the sister's actions. So the author isn't being the asshole for cutting off the sister in response to the sister's over-the-top retaliation. The sister's actions were the last straw, so the author's decision to cut her off is a reaction to that, not necessarily the initial prank.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's initial prank was wrong, but the sister's retaliation was even worse. The author is cutting off the sister because of the sister's actions, not the initial prank. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. They might be at fault for the initial prank, but the current action (cutting off) is a response to the sister's worse behavior. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
