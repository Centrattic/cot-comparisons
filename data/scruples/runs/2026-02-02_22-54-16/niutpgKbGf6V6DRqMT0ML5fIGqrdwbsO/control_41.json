I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation seems a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author had previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's collection of Japanese manga with risqu\u00e9 content in front of the family and a girl he was seeing. The author now wants to cut off their sister and is asking if they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nSo, the key points here are the pranks each side played. The initial prank by the author led to the sister crying, which is pretty harsh. Then the sister's revenge was exposing the author's private collection in a public family setting, causing significant embarrassment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. The author justifies it because the sister went too far. But the sister's action was a direct retaliation for the previous prank. The author's prank was considered bad because it made their sister cry. The sister's retaliation was severe, but was it justified? The author's initial prank was the start of the conflict. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for starting the prank war. However, the sister's response was also extreme. \n\nIn terms of cutting off the sister, the author might feel justified because the sister's actions were so hurtful. But is cutting off a family member over a prank and retaliation considered wrong? The author's action of cutting off the sister is a response to the sister's retaliation. The question is whether the author is the asshole in this case.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions (the initial prank) and the sister's retaliation were both escalations. The author's initial prank was harmful, leading to crying. Then the sister's revenge was even more damaging. However, the author is now cutting off the sister. \n\nThe community usually looks at whether the actions were proportionate. The author's prank was bad because it made the sister cry, which is a serious emotional harm. The sister's retaliation was exposing private items in front of family, which is also harmful. But the author is now cutting off the sister. \n\nSince the author started the conflict with a prank that hurt their sister, they might share some responsibility. However, the sister's response was severe. But the author's response of cutting off the sister is a one-sided action. The sister's prank was worse, but the author's initial prank also was problematic.\n\nIn the end, the author might be seen as partially at fault for starting the conflict. However, the sister's action was worse. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. If the sister's prank was significantly worse, then the author's decision to cut off might be understandable. However, if the author's initial prank was the root, they might not be justified in cutting off the sister. \n\nBut given that the sister's prank caused a major family issue and the author is cutting her off, maybe the author is not the asshole here. The sister's actions were worse, so cutting off the sister could be seen as a justified response. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. If the author's initial prank was the start, but the sister escalated it, the author's response is a reaction to the sister's worse action. So, the author isn't the asshole here. Hence, answer B.\n"
