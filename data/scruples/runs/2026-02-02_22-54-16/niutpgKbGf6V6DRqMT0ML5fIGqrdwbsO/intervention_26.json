I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister with an Xbox box that had a brick inside, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he was seeing. The author is upset because this caused humiliation and family issues. He's wondering if cutting off his sister is justified, especially since he thinks the prank was on the same level as the \"Xbox\" prank.\n\nHmm, so the initial prank (empty box with brick) made the sister cry, which is pretty harsh. Then the sister's revenge was exposing his private collection. The author is now cutting off his sister. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nLet's consider the ethics here. Pranks can be a form of playful teasing, but when they cause emotional harm, like making someone cry, they cross a line. The author's prank resulted in his sister crying, which is a strong emotional response. That might indicate that the prank was excessive or not appropriate.\n\nNow, the sister's revenge was exposing his adult magazines. Those are his private items, so that's a breach of trust and privacy. However, the sister might feel that the author's prank was worse, leading her to retaliate. But exposing someone's private collection to their family is a serious action, especially with potential long-term consequences like family embarrassment and strained relationships.\n\nThe author's response is to cut off his sister. He's trying to see if this is a fair reaction. But cutting off family over a prank and revenge might be seen as extreme. The sister's prank was more harmful in terms of public humiliation and family dynamics. However, the author's initial prank also caused significant distress. \n\nThe key elements here are the intent and the impact. The author might have meant the prank as a joke, but causing the sister to cry is a red flag. The sister's revenge was more invasive and had lasting effects. The author's reaction is cutting off the sister, which is a severe measure. \n\nIn many cases, when someone retaliates in a way that causes more harm, they are considered the asshole. But the author also contributed to the conflict with his initial prank. The sister's action led to family shame and personal embarrassment, which is worse than the brick prank. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for cutting off his sister? Maybe, because the sister's prank had more significant consequences. But the author's initial prank was also problematic. However, the sister's action is arguably more offensive. The author might be within his right to be upset and cut ties, but the question is whether that makes him the asshole. \n\nI think the sister's prank was worse, so the author's reaction of cutting her off is a consequence of her actions. But does that make the author not the asshole? The author's prank caused crying, which is bad, but the sister's prank was more damaging. The author's response is justified in self-defense, so he might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author should have handled it without cutting off family. However, the sister's prank was a major betrayal. The answer is probably B, but I need to be careful. Let me check the Reddit link he mentioned. The previous post was about pranking the sister in front of family, leading her to cry. The author was called an asshole there too. Now, the sister retaliates with exposing his adult content. \n\nIn this case, the sister's action is worse, so the author's retaliation is a response to something more severe. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
