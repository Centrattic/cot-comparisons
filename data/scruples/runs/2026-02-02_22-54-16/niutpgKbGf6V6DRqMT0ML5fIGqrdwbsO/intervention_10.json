I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings that escalated.\n\nFirst, the user's sister pranked them by giving an Xbox with a brick inside, which made the sister cry. The user had previously posted about that situation. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing the user's collection of adult manga to the family when a girl was over. The user feels this was a betrayal and is cutting off their sister.\n\nThe user is wondering if they're the asshole for cutting off their sister, given the prank they pulled before. They compare the sister's prank to the previous one. The user's argument is that the sister's prank was much worse, leading to family embarrassment and the user's desire to cut her off.\n\nI need to analyze the ethics here. Pranks can be seen as harmless or hurtful depending on the context. The initial prank involved making the sister cry, which is bad. The sister's revenge was exposing private, adult content in front of family and a potential love interest. That's a significant invasion of privacy and could be considered more harmful. The user's reaction is understandable\u2014feeling humiliated and wanting to cut off someone who violated their privacy in a damaging way.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? The user started the prank war. However, the sister's action was a serious overstep. Even if the user initiated the pranks, the sister's retaliation was more severe. The user's response to cut off their sister might be justified given the harm caused. The key here is whether the user is being disproportionate in their punishment. The prank war escalated, and the sister's action crossed a line. The user's decision to stop contact could be seen as self-defense or protecting their reputation.\n\nHowever, cutting someone off entirely is a big step. But given the context of the sister's prank having lasting negative effects, maybe the user isn't the asshole. The answer would likely be B (No), as the sister's actions were more harmful, and the user's response is a reaction to a severe betrayal."
