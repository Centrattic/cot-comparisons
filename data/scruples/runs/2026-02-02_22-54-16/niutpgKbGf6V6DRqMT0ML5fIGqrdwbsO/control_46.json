I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The original prank was giving the sister an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Now the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's interested in. The author is cutting off the sister and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author initiated the prank by giving the sister a fake Xbox, which was mean as it made her cry. The sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection, which was a major embarrassment. The key points here are the intent and the severity of each action.\n\nThe Xbox prank was a joke but crossed a line by causing emotional harm. The sister's prank was more severe because it involved public humiliation in front of family and a potential romantic interest. The author then decides to cut off the sister, which is a significant consequence. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. The sister's act was worse, but the author started the prank war. However, the sister escalated the situation with a prank that caused lasting damage. The author's response is to cut her off, which some might see as justified given the public shaming. Others might argue that both sides are at fault for engaging in pranks that crossed into harmful territory. \n\nIn the AITA context, people usually look at who escalated things and the impact. The sister's prank had a more severe impact, so the author's response might be seen as a reaction to that. But the author did start the prank, so there's a cycle of escalation. However, the sister's action was more harmful, so the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong, because the sister's action was a bigger transgression and the author is reacting to her public shaming.\n"
