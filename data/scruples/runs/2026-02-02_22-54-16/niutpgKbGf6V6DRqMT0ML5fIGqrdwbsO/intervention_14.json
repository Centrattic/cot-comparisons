I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings, which escalated when the sister exposed the author's adult manga collection to their family during a visit from someone the author is interested in.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. The sister then retaliated by revealing the author's adult magazines, leading to humiliation. The author is now cutting off the sister and questions if they're the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the pranks and the escalation. The initial prank by the author involved deception and caused emotional harm (making the sister cry). The sister's revenge was more severe and had lasting consequences, exposing private material to family and a potential romantic interest. The author is now cutting off the sister, and the question is whether that's justified.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's prank caused emotional distress first, but the sister's retaliation was more damaging. The author's decision to cut off the sister is a reaction to the sister's overstep. But is cutting someone off ever justifiable in a family context? There's also the aspect of the author having adult material, which they kept secret, but the sister's exposure made it public without consent.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, both actions have issues. The author's prank caused harm, and the sister's retaliation was excessive. However, the sister's action had more severe consequences, especially in terms of public humiliation and potential family conflict. The author's response of cutting off the sister is a form of punishment, but does that make them the asshole? It's a cycle of retaliation. The author might feel justified given the sister's actions, but cutting off family can be seen as harsh unless there's a pattern of abuse.\n\nIn the Reddit community's typical AITA responses, often the person who started the conflict is seen as at fault unless the other's actions are significantly worse. Here, the sister's action seems worse, so the author might not be the asshole for cutting her off. However, the author's initial prank also contributed to the cycle. But since the sister escalated it beyond a prank into something harmful, the author's response could be seen as a justified self-defense measure to prevent further harm.\n\nSo, considering the escalation and the severity of the sister's actions, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer is probably B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
