I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a prank war between siblings and the aftermath. \n\nFirst, the author pranked their sister with a fake Xbox that had a brick inside. That made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to their family and a girl he's seeing. The author is now cutting her off, and wondering if that's justified.\n\nThe key points here are the pranks and the escalation. The initial prank (Xbox prank) was mean enough that it made the sister cry, which is pretty harsh. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection. The author is now cutting off his sister after that. \n\nSo, who's at fault here? Well, pranks can be a grey area, but when they cause emotional harm, like making someone cry, that's a problem. The author's prank led to emotional distress. Then the sister took it further by exposing his personal items in front of family and a guest, which is a significant invasion of privacy and caused humiliation. \n\nThe author is now cutting off his sister. Is that justified? Well, the sister's action was a severe breach, but the author's initial prank was also harmful. However, the sister's action was worse because it involved exposing personal belongings in a public setting with family and a guest. The author's reaction is cutting off contact, which is a natural response to being betrayed or hurt. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for cutting her off? If the sister crossed a line, then the author's response might be justified. However, the author's prior prank was also problematic. But in terms of the immediate incident, the sister's actions were more harmful. \n\nSo, considering the escalation, the sister's action was worse. The author's response is cutting her off, which is a personal choice and a reaction to being betrayed. Since the sister's action was more severe, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
