I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a prank that escalated from the Xbox box with a brick to the sister revealing his adult manga collection in front of family and a girl.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author initially pranked the sister with the Xbox box, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his manga collection, leading to humiliation. The author has cut her off and is questioning if he's the asshole.\n\nI should consider both sides. The sister's prank was more invasive and harmful, exposing personal items in front of family and a friend, which could be seen as crossing a line. The author's prank (the Xbox box) led to her crying, which is also bad but maybe less severe. However, the author's response was to cut her off. The key here is whether cutting off the sister is justified given the context of their mutual pranks.\n\nThe author might argue that the sister's prank was worse, so cutting her off is a reasonable reaction. But does that make the author the asshole? It depends on if cutting off contact is an appropriate response. The sister's action was more public and damaging, so the author's reaction might be seen as self-defense of their reputation. However, some might argue that both pranks were wrong, but the sister's was worse, so the author isn't entirely at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author started it with the Xbox prank, maybe he's at least partially responsible for the escalation. But the sister's action was a significant overstep. The author's cutting off is a personal choice, and while it's harsh, it might be justified given the humiliation caused. The question is whether cutting contact is the right step, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering the Reddit AITA format, the community usually looks at who escalated things and who crossed a line. The sister's prank was more harmful and public, so the author's reaction of cutting her off might be seen as justified. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
