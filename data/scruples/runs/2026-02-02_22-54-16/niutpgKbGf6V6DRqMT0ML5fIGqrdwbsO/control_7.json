I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. The situation involves a series of pranks leading up to a major incident where the sister exposed the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the initial prank: the author gave their sister an Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult magazines. The author feels this was a step too far and has cut off their sister. They want to know if they're the asshole for doing so, considering the previous prank.\n\nI need to assess both sides. The author's prank was a prank that hurt the sister emotionally, which isn't great. The sister's retaliation was more severe, public, and potentially damaging to the author's reputation and family relationships. The author's reaction is to cut off the sister. \n\nThe key points here are the progression of pranks and the concept of escalating retaliation. The author might feel justified because the sister took things too far, but the initial prank was also hurtful. However, the sister's action was more harmful and public. The author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as a response to protect their reputation, but cutting someone off completely is a drastic measure. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here, but socially and relationally, it's about intentions and proportionality. The author's prank, while hurtful, was a prank. The sister's action was deliberate humiliation. The author's response is cutting off contact, which is a personal choice. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether cutting off a sibling over a prank is reasonable. \n\nIn many cases, people might see the sister's action as crossing a line, making the author's response understandable. However, pranks can sometimes be seen as childish, so if the author's initial prank was mean, that could factor in. But given the sister's action was significantly worse, the author's decision to cut her off might be justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
