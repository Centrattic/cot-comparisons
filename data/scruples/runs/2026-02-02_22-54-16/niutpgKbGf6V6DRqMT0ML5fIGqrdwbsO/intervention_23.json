I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, there was an initial prank where the author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. The sister was upset and made the author cry. Then, the sister later pranked the author by exposing their adult manga collection in front of family and a girl he was seeing. The author now wants to know if cutting off the sister is justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are the pranks and the escalation. The author's first prank involved an empty box and a brick, which made the sister cry. The sister's revenge was exposing the author's personal collection, which caused significant embarrassment and family issues.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were justified. The initial prank might have been a joke, but the sister took it too far by making the author cry. Then, the sister's retaliation was more severe. The author's response was to cut off communication. \n\nBut the author's first prank led to the sister's retaliation. The author might be holding the sister accountable for a prank that was a direct response to their own. However, the sister's action was much more harmful, so cutting her off could be seen as justified. Alternatively, the author might have started the prank war, which led to this outcome. \n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for cutting off the sister. The sister's action was worse, but the prank war began with the author. However, the sister's prank had serious consequences. The author's right to set boundaries after being humiliated might be valid. On the other hand, escalating pranks can lead to worse outcomes, so maybe the author should have de-escalated instead of cutting off completely.\n\nBut the sister crossed a line by exposing private items in front of family. The author's reaction could be seen as self-defense against further harm. The initial prank was less severe, so the sister's response was disproportionate. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for cutting off the sister.\n"
