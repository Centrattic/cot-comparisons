I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. The main issue here is the sister exposing his adult manga to the family. \n\nFirst, the original prank: the author gave a brick to his sister as a fake Xbox. That prank made her cry, which is pretty harsh. Then, in retaliation, the sister exposed his adult magazines in front of their family and a girl he's interested in. The author is now cutting her off because he feels she crossed the line.\n\nSo, the key points are: the initial prank led to emotional harm, and the sister's revenge was worse, causing public humiliation. The author is defending his decision to cut her off. The question is whether he's the asshole for doing that.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's prank was cruel and made the sister cry. The sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection, which is a significant breach of privacy and led to family conflict. The author's response was to cut her off. \n\nIs cutting her off justified? The sister's action was more severe and public, causing lasting damage. The author might feel justified in not wanting to reconcile. However, the initial prank was also a problem. The sister's revenge was an overreaction, but the author's response is cutting off a sibling. \n\nIn terms of who is more at fault, the sister's action was worse, but the author's prank started the cycle. However, the sister's prank was a direct retaliation and more harmful. The author is now cutting her off, which is a personal choice, but does that make him the asshole? It depends on societal norms. Usually, cutting off a family member for a one-time, albeit harmful, prank might be seen as extreme if the other person was also at fault. However, the sister's action was a major breach, and the author's response is self-preservation. \n\nSo, considering that the sister's prank was worse and more harmful, the author's decision to cut her off is a reaction to her overstep. The initial prank was bad, but the sister's revenge was more damaging. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
