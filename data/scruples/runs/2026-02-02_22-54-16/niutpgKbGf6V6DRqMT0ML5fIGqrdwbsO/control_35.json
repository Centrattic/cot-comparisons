I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by cutting off their sister after she exposed his adult manga collection. The sister had previously been pranked by the author with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now she retaliated by showing his family his adult magazines.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author pranked his sister before, which upset her. Then, the sister took revenge in a way that was much more hurtful and damaging. The author feels justified in cutting her off, but the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe sister's action was more severe. She exposed personal items that could cause family tension and embarrassment. The author's initial prank involved making her cry, which isn't great either. But the sister's response escalated the situation. The author now faces family disapproval and embarrassment. \n\nHowever, cutting someone off is a big step. Even if the sister overstepped, the author might be reacting in a way that's not healthy. The question is whether the author's response is proportionate. The prank he did before was less harmful compared to the sister's action. He might feel justified, but cutting off a sibling entirely could have long-term consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's action was a clear violation of privacy and trust. She used a prank to expose something personal in front of others, which is pretty harsh. The author's response could be seen as self-defense against ongoing pranks. However, the initial prank (fake Xbox) might have contributed to the cycle of retaliation.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. If the sister overstepped, then the author's reaction might be understandable. However, the author also initiated the prank that upset her. The sister's prank was worse, so the author cutting her off might be a proportionate response. But maybe there's a better way to handle it than cutting someone off completely. \n\nIn the end, the sister's action was more severe and invasive. The author's response of cutting her off could be seen as a justified reaction to a serious violation, especially since the sister's prank was part of a cycle of pranks that escalated. Therefore, the author might not be the asshole here. But I need to check if there are any other factors. The author introduced the girl to the family, which might have been part of the situation. But the sister's action was the catalyst. \n\nSo, considering the severity of the sister's prank and the impact on the author's family and personal life, cutting her off could be seen as a reasonable response. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
