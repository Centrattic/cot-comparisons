I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank war. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation properly. The author previously pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox (a box with a brick), which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his collection of adult manga (hentai) to their family and a girl he was seeing. The author is upset and cut off the sister, but he's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points are: both siblings engaged in pranks. The author's prank caused emotional harm (the sister cried), and the sister's prank caused public humiliation and family embarrassment. The author is now cutting off the sister. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author's initial prank was pretty harsh, leading to the sister's tears. That's a red flag. Maybe he shouldn't have done that. But then the sister took it further by exposing his private collection in front of family and their friend. That's a significant invasion of privacy and could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nThe author is just cutting off the sister after her prank, but the prank was in response to his own prank. So, the cycle started with him. However, the sister's response was more severe in terms of consequences. The problem is that pranks can escalate, and when they lead to emotional distress, it's not just a harmless joke anymore.\n\nThe author's retaliation by cutting off the sister is a response to the sister's actions. But since the initial prank (Xbox) was harmful, perhaps he's at least partially responsible for the escalation. The sister's prank was a form of retaliation, but exposing someone's private collection in front of family could be seen as going too far, especially since the author's collection was his personal property and he might have a right to privacy. However, once the sister did that, the author's reaction of cutting her off might be seen as justified, but he also started the conflict with a harmful prank.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's prank was worse in terms of consequences. The author's initial prank caused her to cry, which is serious. The sister's prank caused public humiliation. Both actions are problematic, but the sister's might be worse. However, the author is cutting off the sister, which is a harsh response. But since the sister crossed a line, maybe the author isn't the asshole here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe both are at fault. The author started the prank war, leading to the sister's retaliation. However, the sister's action was more severe. The author's cutting off the sister is a consequence of her prank, not the initial prank. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the sister's action was the final straw. But the initial prank was also his fault. \n\nIn terms of Reddit's AITA standards, the person who started the prank and then continued to engage in a prank war might be considered the asshole if their actions caused harm. However, the sister's action was more severe. The author might be justified in cutting her off because her prank was worse, but he also started the cycle. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions (the initial prank and then cutting off the sister) are equally as bad as the sister's. The sister's prank was public exposure of private material, which is a bigger deal. The author's initial prank caused emotional harm. The author is cutting off the sister after her worse prank, which could be seen as a reasonable response. So maybe the author isn't the asshole. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered that pranks can escalate and that his initial prank was too harsh. The fact that the sister was retaliating might not excuse her actions, but the author should take some responsibility for starting it. However, the sister's action was more severe and invasive. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the sister's prank was worse and the author's response is a consequence of her actions. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the fact that the author started the prank war makes him partially responsible. But if the sister's action was the breaking point, then the author's response is justified. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the sister's prank was more severe and the author's cutting her off is a response to her crossing a line, despite the initial prank.\n"
