I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person in the Reddit post is the asshole for cutting off their sister after a prank.\n\nFirst, the initial prank: the author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. The sister cried. That's pretty harsh, but maybe the author thought it was a joke. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga to the family in front of a girl they have a complicated relationship with. The author feels humiliated and cut off their sister.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. The author's prank made their sister cry, which isn't great. But then the sister took it a step further with a much more hurtful prank. The author is cutting off their sister, which is a big move. \n\nBut here's the thing: the sister's action was a significant breach of privacy and trust. Exposing someone's personal collection in front of family can cause lasting damage. The author's reaction is to cut off contact, which is a severe consequence. However, considering the sister's prank was more invasive and caused emotional harm, the author might feel justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the author initiated the prank that made their sister cry, so there's a cycle of retaliation. But the sister escalated it to a level that's more harmful. The key here is whether cutting off a sibling is an appropriate response. While the sister's actions were worse, cutting off family is a big step. But in this context, the author's humiliation and the family's reaction might make the author feel that the sister crossed a line. \n\nSo, the author might not be the asshole here. The sister's prank was worse, and the author's response, while extreme, could be seen as a justified reaction to the sister's overstepping. The answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
