I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a prank war between siblings, right? The author first pranked his sister by giving her a box with a brick instead of an Xbox, which made her cry. Then, in retaliation, the sister exposed his adult manga collection to the family in front of his friend. Now, the author is cutting her off because he feels she went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's initial prank was pretty harsh\u2014giving a brick instead of a real Xbox. That could be seen as cruel, especially if it made her cry. But maybe the sister was just retaliating because he did it first. Then, the sister's revenge involved exposing his private collection, which was embarrassing and hurtful. The author is now cutting her off, which is his right, but the question is if he's the asshole here.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a legitimate reason to prank her first? The original prank (the brick) might have been the catalyst. If the first prank was mean, then the sister's response, while also mean, could be seen as retaliation. However, the sister's action was more invasive and damaging, exposing personal items to the family and a friend. The author is now cutting her off, which is a response to the prank.\n\nBut the author is asking if cutting her off makes him the asshole. The question is whether the sister's prank was justified or if the author's initial prank was worse. The original prank (brick) might have been the first wrong, leading to the sister's retaliation. However, the sister's action was more harmful. The author's response is to cut her off, which is a consequence but not necessarily being the asshole here. \n\nThe community's perspective in these AITA posts usually considers intent and proportion. The author's prank was likely meant to be a joke, but it made his sister cry. The sister's revenge, while more damaging, was a direct retaliation. The author might have overstepped initially, but the sister's action was worse. However, the author is now cutting her off, which is fair because he feels wronged. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but the sister went too far. Alternatively, if the author's initial prank was the wrong that started it, he might share some blame. But the question is specifically about cutting her off now. Since the sister's action was worse, cutting her off could be justified. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
