I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and their sister. The author previously pranked the sister by giving her an Xbox box with a brick inside, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he was seeing. The author is cutting off the sister and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's prank made the sister cry, which is pretty harsh. But the sister's retaliation was exposing the author's private collection, which is also a big deal. The author is now being humiliated by family members and the girl, so they cut off contact. The question is whether the author is the asshole for doing that.\n\nIn the first instance, the author's prank caused emotional harm. Even if it was a prank, causing someone to cry is not great. But the sister then took it further by exposing something very personal. The line between a prank and something harmful is important here. The sister's action was more invasive and hurtful, as it involved privacy and family shame. The author is now cutting off the sister, which is a strong reaction. \n\nBut is the author justified in cutting them off? Well, the sister crossed a line by exposing private items. The author might feel betrayed. However, the author also initiated the prank that harmed the sister. But in the follow-up, the sister's action was more severe. The key is whether the author's response is proportionate. Cutting off a sibling is a big move, but if the sister did something that was a major betrayal, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe community on r/AmITheAsshole usually looks at who started the conflict and whether the response is excessive. The author started the prank but the sister escalated it to a damaging level. The author's retaliation (cutting off contact) might be seen as a way to end the cycle. However, the author might have other ways to address it rather than cutting off completely. But given the sister's actions, the author's decision isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering the sister's severe breach of privacy and the humiliation caused, the author's decision to cut her off might be justified. The prank was bad, but the sister's response was worse. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
