I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The author previously gave the sister a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection in front of family and his girlfriend. He's cutting her off now.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's prank with the fake Xbox was pretty harsh, leading the sister to cry. That's a red flag. Then the sister took revenge by exposing his private collection, which caused him significant embarrassment. The key question is whether the author's initial prank was so bad that the sister's retaliation was justified, or if the sister went too far.\n\nThe author is now cutting off the sister because she exposed his stuff. The user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA). The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nThe sister's action was public humiliation in front of family and his girlfriend, which is a big deal. However, the author started the prank war with something that made the sister cry. The sister's retaliation escalated the situation. The author is now cutting her off, which is a response to her actions. \n\nBut the author's initial prank was also pretty mean. The sister was trying to get back at him, and her method was extreme. However, the author's retaliation (cutting off) is a form of punishment. The question is whether the sister's action was a reasonable response to his prank. \n\nIn pranks, there's a line where it becomes harmful. The fake Xbox made her cry, which is crossing into emotional harm. The sister's revenge was exposing his private stuff, which is also harmful. The author now says he won't talk to her again. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both sides did something wrong. The author's prank caused emotional harm. The sister's retaliation caused public humiliation. Cutting off a sibling is a serious action. But was the author's initial prank so bad that the sister's retaliation was justified? Or did the sister go too far?\n\nThe author might argue that the sister's action was worse, but the prank war started with his own prank. However, the sister's action was a direct retaliation that caused lasting damage. The author is now cutting her off. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the line is often whether someone's actions were justified. The author's initial prank was mean, but the sister's retaliation was more harmful. However, both acted in a way that caused harm. The author is cutting off the sister as a response. \n\nThe key is whether cutting off is justified. Since the sister's action caused significant harm, the author might feel justified. However, the initial prank was also harmful. The answer might be that the author isn't the asshole because the sister's action was worse, but there's a nuance here. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be seen as the asshole for starting the prank war. But the sister escalated it. The author is now cutting her off, which might be a proportional response given the harm caused. \n\nConsidering the Reddit AITA norms, the community often focuses on who caused the conflict. The author started it, but the sister's response was worse. However, cutting off a sibling is a big step. The author's actions (both pranks) and the sister's retaliation are all problematic, but the author is ending contact. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because the sister's action was worse, but the initial prank is a factor. However, since the sister escalated it beyond the initial prank, the author's response of cutting off could be justified. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
