I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The author initially pranked his sister by giving her an Xbox that was really a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he was with.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's initial prank was pretty harsh, leading to his sister crying. Pranks can be a form of harmless fun, but when they cause emotional harm, they cross a line. The sister's retaliation was exposing his personal collection, which is a significant invasion of privacy and caused him public humiliation. \n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks and the intent. The author's prank led to emotional distress, and the sister's response was even more damaging. However, the author is now cutting off the sister after her prank. The question is whether the author is the asshole for cutting her off, especially considering his initial prank.\n\nIn the Reddit context, the AITA (Am I the Asshole) community often looks at intent, proportionality, and who escalated the situation. The author started the prank war, which escalated to a point where both parties did things that were hurtful. The sister's action was a direct retaliation but was arguably more harmful. However, the author's initial prank was also harmful. \n\nThe author might feel justified in cutting her off because of her actions, but he also initiated the conflict. The sister's exposure of his private items was a major overstep, but so was the initial prank causing her to cry. The community often considers if someone's actions were a reasonable response. Here, both sides might be seen as at fault. However, the sister's action was more invasive and public, which could make her more at fault. \n\nSo, the author might not be the asshole for cutting her off, especially since she escalated the prank to a harmful level. But he did start the prank war. However, given the severity of her retaliation, the author's decision to cut her off could be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
