I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she exposed his adult manga collection in front of their family. The situation started with a prank war between the siblings. The author previously pranked his sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, in retaliation, the sister exposed his private collection, leading to family embarrassment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial prank. Giving an empty box with a brick instead of an Xbox is a prank that, while maybe not malicious, did make the sister cry. That's a sign that the prank might have been too harsh. Then, the sister's response was to expose his private items during a family gathering. This is a significant escalation. \n\nThe author's decision to cut off his sister could be seen as a reaction to her overstepping. However, cutting off a sibling entirely might be a heavy response. But given the context of the prank war and the sister's actions that caused public humiliation, it's understandable he felt justified. \n\nThe key points are mutual pranks, the sister's retaliation going beyond playful teasing, and the resulting family conflict. The author's actions in cutting off the sister might be seen as self-defense after her harmful retaliation. The initial prank was playful but had negative consequences, and the sister's response crossed a line. So, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting her off. The answer is B.\n"
