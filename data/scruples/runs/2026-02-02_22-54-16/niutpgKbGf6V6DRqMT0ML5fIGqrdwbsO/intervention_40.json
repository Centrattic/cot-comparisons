I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. \n\nFirst, the initial prank: the author gave their sister a fake Xbox with a brick inside, which made her cry. The sister then retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's interested in. The author now feels humiliated and cut her off.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks. The first prank by the author led to emotional harm (the sister cried). The sister's retaliation was more severe, invading his privacy and causing public humiliation. The author is cutting her off because of this.\n\nNow, considering the ethics: pranks should not cause significant harm. The first prank was harmful, which might suggest the author was at fault initially. However, the sister's response was worse, crossing into personal privacy and causing lasting damage. The author's decision to cut her off is a reaction to a more serious offense.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for cutting her off? Well, the sister's actions were more harmful, but the author's initial prank started the cycle. However, the final act of exposing private items was a major transgression. The author's response is understandable as self-preservation. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely at fault. The sister's actions were worse, but the author's initial prank contributed. However, the final decision to cut off a family member over this might be extreme, but given the severity of the sister's actions, it's a reasonable response. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
