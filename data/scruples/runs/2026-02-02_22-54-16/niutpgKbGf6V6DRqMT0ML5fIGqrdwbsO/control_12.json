I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The original poster (OP) pranked the sister with an empty Xbox box, which made her cry. The sister then retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The OP's initial prank led to emotional harm (the sister crying), which is questionable. Pranking can be a form of playful teasing, but when it causes distress, especially in a family setting, it might be seen as crossing a line. However, the sister's retaliation was more severe. Exposing private possessions, especially those that could cause embarrassment, is a significant act. The OP feels the sister overstepped, leading him to cut her off.\n\nNow, considering the principles of fairness and proportionality in conflicts. The OP's prank caused emotional harm, but the sister's response was more invasive and damaging. The key here is whether the sister's action was a justified retaliation or an excessive response. Since the OP had a history of pranks, maybe the sister felt she needed to respond in kind, but the exposure of private content might be too much. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the OP is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. The OP's actions (pranking) led to the sister's retaliation, which then caused him more harm. If the OP's initial prank was inappropriate, he might share some responsibility. But the sister's action, while severe, was a direct response to the prank. The OP's decision to cut her off could be seen as understandable if he feels wronged, but it's also important to consider if he provoked the situation in the first place.\n\nAlso, societal norms around family pranks and privacy matter. Exposing someone's private collection is a breach of trust and privacy, which is generally frowned upon. However, if the sister felt she was retaliating for a prior prank, the line between playful teasing and harmful behavior is blurry. The OP might argue that the sister's actions were out of proportion, but he also initiated the prank war.\n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" framework, the community often looks at intent, proportionality, and who escalated the situation. The OP's prank was the initial provocation, leading to the sister's response. The OP then cutting off the sister could be seen as self-defense in the context of their conflict, but maybe not the wisest approach. However, the main issue is whether he is in the wrong. Given that the sister's action was more harmful and the OP's initial prank was part of the cycle, the answer might lean towards the OP not being entirely in the wrong, but there's nuance. The key is that the sister's action was the straw that broke the camel's back, and the OP's reaction (cutting off) is a response to that, but the initial prank might have set the stage. So the answer might be B (No), as the sister's action was worse, but it's a close call.\n"
