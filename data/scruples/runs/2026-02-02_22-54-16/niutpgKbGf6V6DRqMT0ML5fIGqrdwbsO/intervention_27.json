I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank that escalated.\n\nFirst, there's a history of pranks between the siblings. The author previously pranked their sister with an empty Xbox box containing a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his collection of adult manga to the family in front of a girl he's interested in. This led to family embarrassment and the author cutting ties with his sister.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks and the consequences. The initial prank by the author caused emotional harm (made her cry). Then, the sister's retaliation was more severe, exposing private items to family, which caused significant embarrassment and strained relationships. The author is questioning if cutting off the sister is justified.\n\nI need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The author's prank was a prank but resulted in emotional distress. The sister's prank, while more harmful, was a direct retaliation. However, exposing someone's personal collection in front of family and a romantic interest is a serious breach of privacy and trust. The author's decision to cut off contact might be seen as a reaction to a serious violation, but does that make him the asshole? \n\nOn one hand, the sister's action was a significant overstep. On the other hand, the author's initial prank also caused harm. But the sister's action had more severe consequences. The author is now facing family disapproval and personal embarrassment. The question is whether cutting off the sister is a justified response to her prank, or if the author is equally at fault for starting the prank war.\n\nConsidering that the sister's action was more harmful and invasive, the author's decision to cut her off might be seen as self-preservation. However, some might argue that the author should have de-escalated the situation instead of cutting off family. But given the severity of the sister's prank, the author's reaction is understandable. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
