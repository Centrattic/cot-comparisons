I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves two pranks: first, the author gave their sister a fake Xbox with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection in front of the family and a girl he was introducing. The author is wondering if cutting off the sister is justified.\n\nSo, the initial prank (Xbox with a brick) led to the sister crying. That's a key point. Then, the sister's prank involved revealing something the author considered very private and taboo in their family. The author's response was to cut off the sister, and they're questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nThe core of this is whether the author's actions (both pranks and cutting off the sister) are appropriate. The first prank was a joke, but it had emotional consequences. The sister's retaliation was more severe, invading the author's privacy and exposing personal items in a public family setting. \n\nThe author's justification is that the sister overstepped, so they cut her off. But the sister's action was a response to the original prank. The author might be in the wrong if they started the prank war, leading to the sister's retaliation. However, the sister's prank was more harmful and crossed a line into privacy violation. \n\nBut the question is about the author's current action: cutting off the sister. If the sister's prank was a direct and harmful response to the author's initial prank, does the author have a right to cut her off? It's a cycle of pranks escalating. The author might feel they were defending their privacy, but cutting off family for retaliation might be extreme. \n\nAlso, the author's premise is that the sister's action ruined their standing. The sister might feel she was just getting even. The line between playful pranks and harmful actions is important here. The author's cutting off could be seen as an overreaction, especially if the sister's prank was a result of the author's prior action. \n\nBut maybe the sister's act was indeed crossing a line, and the author's response is justified. However, the author's initial prank made the sister cry, which is a problem. The sister's revenge, while harsh, might be a response to that. The author's decision to cut her off could be seen as a consequence, but is the author the asshole here? \n\nIn terms of Reddit's AITA sub, the answer often hinges on who started the conflict. Since the author initiated the prank that led to the sister's retaliation, they might share some responsibility. However, the sister's action was more damaging, so the author cutting her off could be justified. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's response was proportionate. If the sister's prank caused significant harm, maybe the author is not entirely wrong. However, if the author's initial prank caused the sister to retaliate, then the cycle started with them. \n\nI think the key here is that the sister's prank was a severe breach of privacy and led to public humiliation. The author's cutting her off is a natural reaction. However, the author started the prank war, so maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong for starting the cycle. But the sister's action was worse. The Reddit community often considers the context and who escalated it. \n\nThe original prank was the author's fault, but the sister's revenge was a direct response. The author might be considered the asshole for starting the prank that led to the sister's retaliation. However, the sister's action was worse, so the author cutting her off might be justified. The answer could be B (No), because the sister's action was worse and the author's response is understandable given the past. But maybe the author should have handled it without cutting off their sister, considering family. Alternatively, if the sister had no choice but to retaliate, maybe the author is the asshole for starting it. \n\nHmm. The original prank made the sister cry, which is a problem. The sister's response was exposing the author's private collection. The author's current stance is that the sister crossed the line. The answer might be B (No) because the sister's prank was worse, so the author isn't the asshole for cutting her off. But some might argue that the author started it, so they're part of the problem. However, the sister's action was a significant escalation.\n"
