I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's start by looking at the situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The context provided is that the user previously pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, in retaliation, the sister exposed the user's adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl they were with, causing significant embarrassment.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The user did a prank first, which was harsh enough to make their sister cry. The sister then retaliated with a prank that had real consequences, such as family disapproval and social embarrassment. The user now is cutting off the sister and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks. The initial prank (fake Xbox) caused emotional harm, and the sister's retaliation (exposing private items) caused more severe emotional and social damage. The user is questioning if their response of cutting off the sister is justified.\n\nIn determining if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the proportionality of the pranks. The sister's action seems more harmful as it affected the user's standing with the family and led to personal embarrassment. However, the user also initiated the prank war. But in this case, the sister's prank had real-life consequences, which might tip the balance in favor of the user's reaction being justified.\n\nAnother angle is the context of revenge. The sister's action was a direct retaliation, but the user's response of cutting off communication could be seen as a way to deal with the harm done. However, cutting off communication is a significant action. But considering the emotional trauma caused by the sister's prank, especially in front of a potential romantic interest, it might be seen as a reasonable response.\n\nAlso, the sister's action crossed a personal boundary by exposing the user's private collection, which is a more severe violation than the initial prank. The user's decision to stop contact might be a way to protect themselves from further harm, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nHowever, some might argue that pranks, even if escalating, are part of sibling dynamics and cutting off a sister over this is too extreme. But given the specific consequences and the emotional impact, the user's reaction is more about self-preservation and setting boundaries after a betrayal.\n\nSo, considering the escalation, the harm caused by the sister's prank, and the user's response as a boundary-setting measure, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
