I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about pranks and revenge between siblings. The author first pranked his sister by giving her a fake Xbox with a brick, which made her cry. Then she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his girl friend. He's cutting her off now and asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The initial prank by the author was pretty harsh. The sister was upset, crying, which suggests that the prank went too far. The author had a history of pranking her and thought he was too smart to be pranked back, which might indicate a pattern of behavior that wasn't considerate of her feelings.\n\nThen, the sister's revenge was exposing his manga. The author mentions that the manga has risque content, and the family is upset because of it. But the sister took it to an extreme by showing them in front of the family and the girl friend. That's a big deal because it's a serious invasion of privacy and caused public humiliation.\n\nThe question is whether the author's initial prank and his subsequent decision to cut off his sister makes him the asshole. The key here is about the escalation of pranks. The first prank (fake Xbox) was pretty mean, leading to her crying. Then her revenge was exposing his personal collection. The author is now cutting her off, but is that justified?\n\nIn terms of the Reddit AITA posts, the community often looks for who crossed a line. The sister's prank was more harmful and public, causing lasting damage to his relationship with his family. The author's prank was hurtful but maybe not as severe. However, the author started it by giving her a prank that made her cry. So, maybe he's partially at fault for starting the cycle. But the sister escalated it to a much worse level.\n\nThe author is now cutting her off as a response. Is that fair? If someone does something that causes you harm, you have the right to distance yourself. But if the initial prank was also wrong, does that make the author equally at fault?\n\nI think the sister's action was worse because it's a severe breach of privacy and caused significant harm. The author's response of cutting her off might be justified as a self-protection measure after her extreme action. However, the initial prank was also mean-spirited. But the sister's prank was the direct cause of the current conflict. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here. But maybe he is partially responsible for starting it.\n\nIn AITA posts, sometimes people are called out for starting the conflict, but if the other person escalated it, the initial person isn't necessarily the full asshole. The sister's prank was worse, so she's more at fault. Therefore, the author's cutting her off is a reaction to her worse behavior. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
