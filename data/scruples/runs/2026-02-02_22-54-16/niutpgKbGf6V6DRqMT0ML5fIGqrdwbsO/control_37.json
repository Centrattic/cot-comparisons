I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the initial prank: the author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. That made her cry. The sister then got revenge by exposing his adult manga to the family in front of a girl he's seeing. The author is now cutting off the sister and wonders if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The first thing to consider is whether the author's actions were appropriate. The prank with the Xbox box was pretty harsh, leading to her crying. Then, when the sister retaliated, she exposed his private collection in front of the family and the girl. That's a big deal because it's very embarrassing and could have lasting effects on family dynamics.\n\nThe question is whether cutting off the sister makes the author the asshole. The author's prank was mean, but the sister's retaliation was more severe. The sister took something private and made it public, which is a serious breach. The author feels justified in cutting her off because of that.\n\nBut wait, does the author have a right to be upset? The sister did cross a line by exposing his private stuff. However, the author initiated the prank that caused her to cry, which might be a factor. But the sister's action was a direct response, escalating the situation. The author is now cutting her off, which is a significant step.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong: the sister's action was more harmful and invasive. The author's prank was hurtful but not as damaging as exposing private possessions in front of family. The author cutting off the sister is a reaction to a severe violation. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here because the sister overstepped. But maybe the author should try to reconcile or communicate instead of cutting her off completely.\n\nBut the sister's action was extremely humiliating and had consequences beyond the initial prank. The author's decision to cut her off could be seen as a response to protect himself and his standing in the family. The sister's prank was more about revenge and caused lasting damage. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
