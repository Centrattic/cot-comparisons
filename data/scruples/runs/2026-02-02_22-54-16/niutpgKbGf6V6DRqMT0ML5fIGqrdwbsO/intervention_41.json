I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where they pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing their collection of Japanese manga with risqu\u00e9 content in front of family and a girl they had over. The author is now cutting off their sister and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The initial prank: the author gave their sister an empty box with a brick. That seems pretty mean, especially if it made her cry. Pranks can be funny if they're light-hearted and both parties are in on it, but when someone is hurt, it's no longer a joke. The sister's reaction of crying shows that the prank was harmful. \n\nThen, the sister's retaliation. She took the author's manga books and showed them to the family and the girl. The author's family is upset, and the girl is mocking them. The manga, even if not Playboy, still contains nudity and other content that's inappropriate to share with family, especially in front of a guest. The sister's action led to public humiliation for the author. \n\nThe author is now cutting off their sister. The question is whether this is justified. The key here is the escalation. The first prank was bad because it caused emotional harm. The sister's revenge was worse because it caused significant social and family issues. The author might feel that the sister overstepped, but their own prank also started the conflict. \n\nBut wait, the initial prank was initiated by the author. They posted about it before, and the sister was retaliating. The sister's action was a direct response, but it's more severe. The author is now saying they won't talk to her again. The sister's prank was more harmful in terms of the fallout. However, the author's initial prank might have sparked this. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. The sister's prank was worse, but the author's actions contributed to the conflict. The question is whether the author's response is justified. They might be holding onto the idea that they were the initial prankster, but the sister's action was a significant escalation. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the author isn't in the wrong because the sister's prank was worse. But maybe there's a point where the author could have de-escalated the situation. However, the sister's exposure of the manga in front of the family and the girl caused real harm, so cutting her off might be a reasonable response. \n\nI should consider if the author's initial prank was a provocation. Since it made the sister cry, that's a red flag. The sister's retaliation was severe, but the author might have started it. But the author is now reacting to a more severe action. \n\nIn the end, the sister's action was worse, but the author's initial prank also played a role. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. If the sister's prank was significantly worse and caused more damage, then the author's response might be justified. So the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
