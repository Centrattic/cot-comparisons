I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, there's the initial prank where the author gave their sister a fake Xbox. That made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection in front of the family and a girl he was seeing. The author is now cutting off their sister, and the question is whether this is justified.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author admits to pranking the sister first, which caused her to cry. The sister then took revenge by exposing the author's private collection, which led to humiliation. The author is now cutting off contact because of this.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, pranking someone can be seen as harmless fun, but when it causes emotional harm, like making someone cry, it crosses a line. However, the sister's retaliation was much more severe. Exposing private, adult material in front of family and a friend is a significant invasion of privacy and could be considered a much harsher prank. The author felt this was a betrayal and a serious overstep, which is understandable.\n\nBut does the author have a right to cut their sister off? The initial prank might be seen as the seed of this conflict. The author's prank led to the sister's retaliation. However, the sister's actions were more harmful. The author is now cutting off the sister as a result of the sister's actions. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response (cutting off the sister) is justified. The author feels wronged by the sister's exposure of their collection. Cutting off a family member is a heavy step, but it's their choice if they feel the sister crossed a line. The sister's action was more extreme, but the author's initial prank also contributed to the situation.\n\nHowever, in terms of right and wrong, the sister's action was more harmful. The author's initial prank was bad, but the sister escalated it. The author's decision to cut off the sister is a response to the sister's actions, not the initial prank. So the author might not be in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. The sister's actions were more severe, so the author's reaction is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
