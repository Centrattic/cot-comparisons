I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author here is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank war between siblings that escalated. First, the author pranked his sister by giving her a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. The author cut off his sister and is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main points are: the initial prank was pretty harsh, making the sister cry. Then the sister's retaliation was even worse, exposing his private stuff in a very public way. The author is questioning if cutting her off is justified.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Pranks can be okay if they're lighthearted, but when they cause emotional harm, that's a problem. The first prank made the sister cry, which is pretty severe. Then the sister's response was exposing private, personal items. That's a significant invasion of privacy and could cause lasting family tension. \n\nThe author is cutting off his sister because of her actions. But the cycle started with his prank. Maybe he should have considered the consequences of his initial prank, especially since it made her cry. However, the sister's retaliation was far worse. She exposed something very personal and sensitive, which could have lasting effects. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for cutting her off? If the sister crossed a line, then the author's response might be justified. But the initial prank was also a problem. The key is whether the author's actions (cutting off) are proportionate. If the sister's prank was worse, then cutting off might be understandable. But pranks that escalate to humiliation and family conflict are usually bad. \n\nThe author might be justified in cutting off the sister because her actions were more harmful, but he should also reflect on his initial prank. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong now. Since the sister's actions were more severe and the author is responding to that, maybe he's not the asshole here. The answer might be B.\n"
