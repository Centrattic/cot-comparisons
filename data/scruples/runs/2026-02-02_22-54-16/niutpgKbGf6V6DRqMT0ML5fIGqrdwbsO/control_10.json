I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The original situation involves a prank where the author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's manga collection to their family in front of a girl he's interested in.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's previous prank was pretty harsh, leading to the sister crying. That's a red flag. Now the sister's prank is exposing his adult content, which caused humiliation. The author is cutting her off because he feels she crossed a line.\n\nThe key points here are mutual pranks escalating. The sister's action was more severe in terms of public humiliation and long-term consequences. The author is now cutting off his sister, but is that justified? The sister's prank was worse and possibly more harmful. However, the author had a history of pranking first.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her off. The sister's action was in retaliation, but it was more damaging. The author might feel justified, but cutting off family can be a big decision. However, the prank was a direct hit on his reputation and relationships. The sister's prank, while worse, was in response to the author's initial prank. But maybe the author's retaliation for the prank is justifiable since the sister overstepped. But was the author's initial prank also wrong?\n\nIn the first link mentioned, the author previously prank-called his sister, leading to her crying. So his initial prank was harmful. Then the sister retaliated with a worse prank. The author is now cutting her off. The question is if he's the asshole for not accepting her apology or cutting her off. \n\nIn terms of moral wrongs, the sister's action was more harmful, so the author's reaction might be understandable. But if the author's initial prank was also unkind, maybe he's contributing to the cycle. However, the sister's action was more severe. The author is reacting to the sister's overstep. \n\nSo, in this case, the sister's prank was worse, and the author's cut-off is a response to her crossing a line. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
