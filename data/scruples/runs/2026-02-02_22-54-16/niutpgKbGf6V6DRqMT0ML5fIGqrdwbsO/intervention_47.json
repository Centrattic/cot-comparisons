I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a prank war between siblings and then cutting off the sister after she exposed his adult manga collection to the family. \n\nFirst, the user pranked his sister with an empty Xbox box, which made her cry. Then she retaliated by revealing his adult magazines in front of his family and a girl he's seeing. He's upset and cut her off.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole for cutting off his sister and if his actions are justified compared to her prank. \n\nI need to consider the escalation of pranks. The initial prank was giving her a brick in an Xbox box. That might be mean but not necessarily harmful. The sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection, which caused significant embarrassment and family issues. \n\nThe user is cutting off the sister because she went too far. But was the sister's action a justified response? Maybe she felt the prank was personal and wanted revenge. However, exposing someone's private stuff in front of family is a big deal. The user's prank made her cry, but the sister's retaliation caused lasting damage to the user's reputation and relationships.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, he did start the prank war. But the sister escalated it to a point that was harmful. Cutting off communication could be a reaction to the damage done. But cutting someone off is a serious action. Maybe the user was justified in feeling wronged, but the sister's actions were more harmful. \n\nAlternatively, he might be in the wrong for pranking her in the first place, leading to her retaliation. However, the prank's severity and the sister's response are key factors. The user's prank led to emotional harm, and the sister's response led to public humiliation. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong for cutting off the sister after her extreme retaliation. The sister's action was worse, so the user's decision to cut her off is a reasonable response. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
