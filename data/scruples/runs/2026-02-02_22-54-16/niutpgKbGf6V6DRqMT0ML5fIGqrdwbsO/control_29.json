I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is the asshole for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. The situation involves a cycle of pranks and escalating consequences.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a family event where he had a girl over. The author feels humiliated and has cut off his sister, asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. The sister's prank was severe: exposing private items in front of family and a potential romantic interest. This could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since the author had warned about the magazines due to younger siblings. The sister's action led to family disapproval and personal humiliation.\n\nThe author's initial prank (fake Xbox) made her cry. However, the sister's retaliation was significantly more harmful. The author cutting off contact could be a reaction to the sister's overstep. But does that justify cutting her off? Maybe the author should have addressed the prank differently, like setting boundaries instead of escalating the prank war. But the sister's action was more serious. The author's prank was juvenile, but revenge was taken to an extreme level. \n\nThe key is whether the author's response is proportionate. Cutting off a sibling is a big step, but given the sister's actions, maybe it's understandable. The author might feel justified. However, the initial prank was also hurtful. The sister's response was worse, but the author's decision to cut her off is a personal choice. The question is if the author is the asshole. The sister's action was more severe, so the author might not be in the wrong. So, answer B (No).\n"
