I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. The situation involves a prank war between the siblings, starting with the author giving an Xbox box with a brick, which made the sister cry. The sister then retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection in front of family and a girl he's interested in.\n\nFirst, the author's initial prank was a box with a brick, leading to the sister crying. That seems pretty harsh. Then the sister, in turn, took it further by exposing the author's private collection, which embarrassed him in front of family and a girl. The author now wants to cut off the sister and is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the escalating nature of the pranks. The author started with a prank that hurt the sister emotionally, leading to her retaliation. The sister's prank was more invasive and caused significant humiliation. The author is upset about being exposed in front of family and the girl, which is understandable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister.\n\nThe author's actions of cutting off the sister are a form of punishment for the prank. However, considering the context, the author's initial prank was also harmful. The sister's response, while more severe, was a direct retaliation. The author might feel justified in cutting off the sister to protect their reputation, but the sister's prank crossed a line into privacy invasion. On the other hand, the author's initial prank started the cycle.\n\nIt's a bit of a cycle of retaliation. The sister's prank was more damaging, but the author's cutting off might be seen as a proportionate response. However, cutting off a sibling entirely over a prank, even if it's escalated, could be seen as harsh. The author might be overreacting, but given the sister's actions, it's also a defense mechanism.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sister's prank was worse, maybe the author has a point. But the author started the prank war with something that made the sister cry. The sister's response was more severe, but the author's cutting off is a personal choice. The author isn't necessarily the asshole here because they were reacting to a serious breach of privacy. However, the initial prank might be part of the problem. But in the current situation, the sister's prank was worse, so the author cutting off might be justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
