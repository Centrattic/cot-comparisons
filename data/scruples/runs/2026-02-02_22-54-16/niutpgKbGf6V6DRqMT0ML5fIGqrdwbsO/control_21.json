I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his girlfriend. The author is upset and wants to cut off their sister, but they're questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are the nature of the pranks and the escalation. The first prank involved making the sister cry, which is harmful. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing personal belongings that the author wanted to keep private, leading to family embarrassment. The author is now cutting off their sister, but is that justified?\n\nPranks can be harmless, but when they cause emotional harm, they cross a line. The first prank (the brick box) made her cry, which is more serious than a typical prank. The sister's response was even more severe\u2014exposing something the author considered private. The author argues it's retaliation for the initial prank, but the sister's action caused significant humiliation.\n\nThe author is now cutting off their sister. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's action was definitely crossing a line, but the author had previously done something that hurt their sister emotionally. However, the sister's retaliation was worse. So, should the author have handled it differently? Maybe, but the sister's action was more harmful. The author might feel justified in cutting ties after such a public humiliation, especially since the sister escalated beyond the initial prank.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, both sides have issues. The author's initial prank hurt their sister, but the sister's response was far more damaging. The author might be within their right to cut her off after such an invasion of privacy and public shaming. However, cutting someone off entirely is a big step, but given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. So, the answer would be B\u2014the author isn't the asshole because the sister's action was worse.\n"
