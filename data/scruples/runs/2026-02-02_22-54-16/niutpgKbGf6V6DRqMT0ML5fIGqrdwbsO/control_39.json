I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is wrong for cutting their sister off after a prank. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, there's the initial prank where the author tricked their sister with an empty Xbox box containing a brick. That prank made the sister cry, which is pretty harsh. The author admits to that in a previous Reddit post. Then, the sister vowed revenge. Now, the sister has pranked back by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family and a girl who was visiting. The author feels humiliated and has cut off their sister. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for doing so.\n\nSo, who started it? The author's first prank led to the sister crying. That sets a precedent. The sister's retaliation was exposing the author's private collection. The author is now cutting off their sister. Let's consider the severity of each prank. The Xbox prank caused emotional harm, while the sister's prank caused public humiliation and potential damage to the author's reputation with family and the girl. \n\nThe author argues that the sister crossed a line, but the author also initiated a prank that was hurtful. The sister's action was more invasive, as it involved exposing private belongings in front of others. However, the author's initial prank was also harmful. The key here is whether cutting off communication is a reasonable response. \n\nThe author might feel justified, but the sister's action was more about privacy and family reputation. The author's collection, while personal, is considered inappropriate for some family members, so the sister's action might be seen as protecting the family from that content. However, the method of exposure was harsh. \n\nThe author's response is cutting off the sister entirely. Is that fair? Maybe they could have communicated without cutting off. But the sister's prank was clearly over the top. The author's initial prank was also problematic. So, both sides have issues. But the sister's action was worse in terms of consequence. The author is reacting to a more severe prank, which might make their cutting off understandable, but maybe they should consider reconciliation. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the author is asking if cutting off was wrong, considering their own prior prank, maybe they share some responsibility. But the sister's action was worse. The line is whether the author's response is justified. Since the sister's prank had serious consequences, cutting off might be seen as a reasonable reaction. So, maybe the author isn't the asshole here. Alternatively, both are at fault. But the options are A or B. The user wants a yes or no. \n\nHmm. The sister's prank was worse, but the author's initial prank was also harmful. The author's reaction is cutting off the sister. Given that the sister crossed a major line, the author's response is understandable. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The author's prank made the sister cry, which is bad. The sister's prank caused public humiliation and family issues. The author's cutting off is a reaction to that. The sister escalated things beyond the initial prank. So the author's response is a defense against a worse action. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole. Answer B.\n"
