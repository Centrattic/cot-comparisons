I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between the author and their sister. The author previously pranked the sister by giving her a fake Xbox, which made her cry. The sister then vowed revenge. Now, the sister pranked the author by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's seeing. The author is cutting off the sister and is asking if he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both sides. The author's initial prank involved a fake Xbox with a brick, leading to the sister crying. That seems pretty harsh, especially if it resulted in emotional distress. Pranks can be innocent, but when they cause someone to cry, it might cross a line. However, the sister then took revenge by exposing his manga collection. The author's manga is Japanese and has risqu\u00e9 content, but he mentions they aren't Playboy and he's had them for years. The sister's action led to public humiliation in front of his family and a girl he's interested in.\n\nThe key points here are the proportionality of the pranks and the intent behind them. The author's prank made his sister cry, which is significant. The sister's retaliation involved exposing private, personal items that could be seen as sensitive by the family. However, the sister's action was more damaging, causing lasting embarrassment and affecting the author's relationship with his family and the girl. \n\nThe author is cutting off the sister because she went too far. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. Since the sister's action was more severe and invasive, the author's decision to cut her off could be justified as self-defense against further harm. However, the initial prank might put him in a position where he's also at fault for starting the cycle of pranks. But the sister escalated the situation. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the sister's prank was more harmful and crossed a privacy line. The author's response is to cut her off, which is a common reaction when someone feels betrayed or when trust is broken. The author might not be the asshole here because the sister's actions were more egregious. However, the initial prank was also problematic. But since the sister escalated it, the author's cutoff might be justified. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong), because the sister's actions were more severe and the author is reacting to the harm caused.\n"
