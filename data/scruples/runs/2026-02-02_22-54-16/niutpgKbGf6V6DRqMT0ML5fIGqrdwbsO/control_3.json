I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a sibling prank war that escalated. The author initially gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. The sister then retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to their family in front of a girl the author had over. The author is now cutting off their sister and is asking if they're the asshole (ITA) for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sequence of events. The author started a prank war by pranking their sister, which led to her crying. Then the sister got revenge by exposing the author's private collection, causing embarrassment. The author is now cutting the sister off and wants to know if they're wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about the nature of the pranks and the response. The initial prank (fake Xbox) made the sister cry, which is pretty harsh. The sister's revenge was exposing the author's private items, which is a big invasion of privacy and led to significant embarrassment. The author is now cutting off their sister, which is a serious consequence.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's initial prank was cruel and caused emotional harm. The sister's retaliation, while also hurtful, might be seen as a response to the author's actions. However, exposing someone's private collection in front of family and a guest is a major overstep. The author feels wronged because the prank escalated beyond their control.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister. The author's action is a form of punishment for the sister's prank, but is that justified? The sister's prank was worse in terms of privacy violation and emotional impact. However, the author started the prank war, which is a factor.\n\nIn typical \"Am I the Asshole\" discussions, the community often looks at who escalated the conflict. The sister's action was more harmful, but the author's initial prank was also problematic. The author cutting off their sister is a consequence, but does that make them the asshole? It might not, because the sister's action was worse. However, cutting off a sibling is a serious step. The author might be justified in feeling that the sister overstepped, but the initial prank was on the author's side.\n\nAnother angle: the sister's revenge was in response to the author's prank, but she went too far. The author's punishment (cutting off) could be seen as a natural consequence, but is it wrong? The author is also being hypocritical because they started the prank, so their reaction might be seen as the asshole move.\n\nBut given that the sister's prank was more severe and the author is now cutting off their sister, the answer might be that the author isn't the asshole, as the sister's actions were worse. However, the author should consider the initial prank's impact and maybe seek a resolution instead of cutting off entirely. But in terms of right or wrong, the sister's action was more severe. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. The author's initial prank was bad, but the sister's revenge was worse. Cutting off might be a reaction to that, so the author might not be the asshole. So answer B."
