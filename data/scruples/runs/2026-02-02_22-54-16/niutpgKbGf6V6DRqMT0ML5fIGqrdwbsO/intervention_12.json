I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. The situation involves a series of pranks between siblings.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick. That prank made her cry. Now, in retaliation, the sister revealed his collection of adult manga to the family in front of a girl he's seeing. The author is upset and cut off the sister.\n\nI need to assess both sides. The initial prank was a prank that caused emotional harm (crying). The sister's retaliation escalated things by exposing something very personal and sensitive in front of others and family. The author's response is cutting off communication. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points: pranks can be playful, but when they cause harm, especially emotional, they cross a line. The sister's action was a significant invasion of privacy and caused humiliation. The author's response of cutting off the sister seems like a reaction to a severe betrayal. However, the author initiated the prank war, so maybe they share some responsibility.\n\nBut the sister's prank was worse in terms of consequences. The author's decision to cut off the sister is a personal choice to protect themselves, especially after a serious violation. The answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole, but it's a bit nuanced. The sister's actions were more harmful, so the author's response is justified. So, answer B.\n"
