I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a prank war between siblings. The author previously pranked his sister by giving her a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit with a girl. The author is cutting her off and asking if he's an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the pranks. The initial prank was a fake Xbox with a brick, which is a common prank but could be seen as mean if it made her cry. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection in front of the family and a girl he's interested in. That's pretty harsh and public humiliation. The author feels justified in cutting her off because she crossed a line.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks. The first prank was a joke that went too far, making her cry. The sister's response was more severe, invading his privacy and causing significant embarrassment. The author's decision to cut her off is a reaction to her actions. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to check if cutting her off is the right move.\n\nIn terms of morality, pranks should be consensual and not cause lasting harm. The sister's prank was invasive and hurtful, potentially damaging family relationships. The author might feel justified in ending contact because the prank was a betrayal of trust and privacy. However, cutting someone off entirely can be extreme, but given the context, it could be seen as a self-defense measure against further humiliation.\n\nThe Reddit post's context from before (the fake Xbox) suggests a history of pranks. The sister's action was more severe, so the author isn't the asshole here. The answer is B.\n"
