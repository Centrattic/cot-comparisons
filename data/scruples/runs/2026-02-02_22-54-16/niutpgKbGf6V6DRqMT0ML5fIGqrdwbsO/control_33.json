I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The author initially pranked his sister by giving her an Xbox box with a brick inside, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit from a girl he's interested in. The author is cutting off his sister now and wants to know if he's the asshole (ITA) for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the actions of both parties. The author's prank caused his sister to cry, which is a strong emotional reaction. Pranks should be lighthearted, but if they cause harm like crying, that's problematic. Then the sister took revenge by exposing his private collection in front of family and the girl, leading to humiliation and family tension. \n\nThe core question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. Both sides have done something hurtful. The author's prank was mean-spirited if it made her cry. The sister's retaliation was more public and damaging, exposing private things. \n\nBut the author is now cutting off communication. Is that justified? The sister's action was worse in terms of consequences, but the author's initial prank started the conflict. However, the sister escalated it significantly. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, both acted inappropriately. The author's prank was wrong because it caused emotional harm. The sister's prank was worse because it invaded privacy and caused public humiliation. The author's response to cut off his sister might be seen as a reaction to the sister's more severe action. But the author also started the prank war. \n\nThe key is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. The sister's actions were more severe, so the author's decision to cut her off might be understandable. But he did start the conflict. However, in such situations, if someone escalates and causes significant harm, the other party's response might be justified. \n\nReddit's AITA thread usually considers intent and consequences. The sister's action had lasting consequences, so the author's response is a reaction to her overstepping. The original prank was bad, but the sister went further. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here. \n\nBut the initial prank caused harm, so that's a point against him. However, the sister's retaliation was worse. So the answer might be B (No), as the author's cut-off is a response to her more severe action, even though he started it. But in AITA judgments, escalating pranks can lead both to blame. But since the sister's action was worse, the author's response is justified. So answer B."
