I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves two pranks: first, the author gave their sister a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his friend.\n\nThe key points here are the escalating nature of the pranks and the harm caused. The first prank, the fake Xbox, led to emotional distress. The sister's retaliation was significantly more harmful, causing public humiliation and damaging the author's relationship with his family. The author then cut off the sister, which is the main point of contention.\n\nI need to consider if cutting off a sister is an appropriate response to such a prank. Pranks can be a form of harmless fun, but when they cross into emotional or physical harm, they become problematic. The sister's prank led to serious consequences, affecting the author's family dynamics and personal relationships. The author's decision to cut her off might stem from feeling that the sister overstepped, but it's important to assess if cutting off is a reasonable reaction.\n\nHowever, the original prank by the author (the fake Xbox) also caused harm, which the sister was retaliating against. This creates a cycle of pranks where both parties contributed to the escalation. The author might feel justified in cutting off the sister to protect themselves from further harm, especially since the sister's action had lasting negative effects.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The sister's prank was a direct retaliation for the prior harm. The author initiated the prank war, which the sister responded to. The question is whether the author's final action of cutting off the sister is disproportionate. While the sister's prank was more harmful, the author's response of cutting off communication could be seen as a way to set a boundary after being wronged. However, it's also possible that the author should have addressed the issue more directly rather than severing all contact.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, cutting off a family member over a prank might be seen as an overreaction unless there's a history of abuse or ongoing issues. But in this case, the prank had real consequences, so the author's reaction might be understandable. The key factors are intent, harm, and proportionality. The sister intended to retaliate, but the harm was significant. The author's response was to cut her off, which is a serious action.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because the sister's prank was a direct and severe retaliation, and the author's decision to cut her off was a reaction to protect their own well-being. However, others might argue that cutting off a sibling is too harsh, regardless of the prank's impact. The answer hinges on whether the prank crossed a line and if cutting off is an acceptable boundary.\n"
