I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (the author) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick. That made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his collection of adult manga to the family when he had a girl over. The author is upset, feels humiliated, and has decided to cut off contact with his sister.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her off. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The initial prank by the author (the brick in the Xbox box) led to the sister crying. That's a clear escalation. Then the sister's revenge was exposing his private collection. The author is now cutting her off because of that. \n\nIs the author the asshole? Well, both sides did things that escalated the conflict. The author started the prank war with something that hurt his sister. Then the sister retaliated in a way that caused significant humiliation for the author. \n\nThe author is defensive, saying he felt the sister was the one who crossed a line. But is cutting off family over a prank (even a hurtful one) reasonable? Maybe. But the sister's action was more serious, invading his privacy and exposing something personal in front of family and a guest. \n\nHowever, the author initiated the prank that led to the sister's hurt feelings. So there's a back-and-forth here. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister after her prank. \n\nIn terms of Reddit's AITA standards, people often consider the proportionality of actions. The sister's prank was more severe, but the author started it. However, cutting off family is a big step. But if the sister's action was a clear violation of privacy, maybe the author isn't the asshole for deciding to cut her off. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be seen as escalating the prank war and then being upset when the sister escalated further. The sister's action was more harmful, though. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), because the sister's action was more severe and invasive, and the author is protecting his own privacy and reputation. The initial prank was bad, but the sister's retaliation was worse. So cutting her off is a reaction to a more serious breach.\n"
