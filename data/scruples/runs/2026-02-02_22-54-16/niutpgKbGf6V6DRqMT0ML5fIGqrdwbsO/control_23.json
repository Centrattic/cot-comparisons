I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a prank war between siblings. The author first pranked his sister with an Xbox box filled with a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to their family and a girl he had over. The author is cutting off his sister and is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial prank. The author's prank involved making a fake Xbox, which led to his sister crying. That's pretty harsh. Pranks that make someone cry can be harmful, even if they're jokes. It might not be physical harm, but emotional harm is still real. So, the author's initial prank was probably not great.\n\nThen the sister's retaliation. She takes his manga, which he's had for years, and shows them to the family. The author mentions the manga has some risqu\u00e9 content, but they're not illegal or anything. However, the sister's action led to public humiliation in front of family and a girl. The author's mom is upset because of younger siblings, and relatives are mocking him. The sister's prank had serious consequences for the author's reputation and relationships.\n\nNow, the author is cutting off the sister. He's asking if he's the asshole. The key question is whether the sister's prank was proportionate to the initial prank. The author's prank made her cry, but the sister's response was exposing personal items that the author kept. The author had the manga in his possession, so maybe he should have kept them private. But pranks are supposed to be light-hearted, and exposing someone's private collection in front of family is a big escalation. The sister's action was more harmful and public.\n\nHowever, the author also had a prank that made his sister cry, so he's not blameless. The sister's prank was worse in terms of consequences, but the author's initial prank set off the retaliation. The question is whether cutting off the sister is justified. The author is saying he's not the asshole because the sister went too far, but does that make him right?\n\nIn the Reddit AITA context, people often consider the intentions and the escalation. The author's prank was mean, but the sister's response was more harmful. However, both pranks were escalations. The author's cutting off the sister could be seen as a justified reaction to the harm caused, especially if the sister's prank was more severe. But the author should also take some responsibility for starting the prank war. However, since the sister's prank had more damaging effects, maybe the author isn't the asshole here. Alternatively, maybe both are at fault, but the sister more so. \n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong for cutting her off. Since the sister's prank was more severe and the author is the one cutting off contact, which is a personal choice, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a moral obligation to forgive or if cutting off is acceptable after a serious prank. In AITA, people often say that if someone causes significant harm, cutting them off is justified. Since the sister's prank caused public humiliation and family issues, the author's reaction is understandable. So the answer is probably B.\n"
