I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a back-and-forth prank scenario. \n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family during a visit with a girl. The author is now cutting off their sister, questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nI need to consider the escalation of pranks. The initial prank (Xbox prank) was hurtful, leading to the sister's revenge. The sister's action was more invasive and damaging, causing family embarrassment. The author might feel justified in cutting off a family member who caused significant harm.\n\nBut is cutting off the sister the right move? The author's actions could be seen as self-defense after being betrayed. However, cutting off family can be severe. The sister's prank went beyond a simple joke, invading privacy and causing lasting family tension. The author might feel their reputation and respect within the family were ruined due to the sister's actions.\n\nThe key points are the sister's intent to retaliate, the method (exposing private material), and the author's response (cutting off). The author's prior prank was harmful but might be seen as less severe than the sister's. The sister's action was public and damaging, so the author's decision to end the relationship could be seen as a last resort. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the sister's prank was more malicious and had lasting negative effects. The author's response might be justified as self-preservation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
