I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings leading to a significant fallout.\n\nFirst, the initial prank by the author: they gave their sister an Xbox box with a brick inside. The sister was upset and even cried. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to family, including a girl the author had over. The author feels this was a severe betrayal and decided to cut off their sister.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's prank led to emotional distress, but the sister's response was worse. Exposing someone's private collection in front of family and a potential romantic interest is a major invasion of privacy. The sister's action was more harmful and public, causing lasting damage to the author's reputation within the family. The author cutting off the sister is a reaction to that severe betrayal.\n\nThe key points are the escalation of pranks, the sister's overstepping, and the author's response. The author might feel justified, but cutting off a sibling entirely can be extreme. However, given the sister's actions were more hurtful and the author was the initial pranker, it's balanced. The sister's prank had real consequences, while the author's pranks were less severe. So the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
