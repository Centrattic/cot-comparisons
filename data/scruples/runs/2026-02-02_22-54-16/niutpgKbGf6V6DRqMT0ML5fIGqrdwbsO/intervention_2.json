I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong after their sister pranked them by exposing their adult manga collection during a visit. The author had previously pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox, which made her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The initial prank involved a fake Xbox with a brick, leading to the sister crying. The author then asked about that in a previous post, but the current question is about cutting off the sister after she retaliated by exposing the adult magazines in front of the family and a girl he's seeing.\n\nThe key points here are: the sister's prank was more severe, leading to family disapproval and the girl mocking him. The author is now cutting off the sister, and wants to know if he's the asshole by doing so. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but the question is to determine if the author is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no).\n\nI should consider the concept of escalating pranks. The initial prank was harmless (fake Xbox), but the sister's retaliation was exposing something sensitive and personal. The author's response is to cut off the sister. Now, the challenge is to assess whether the author's reaction is excessive or justified given the context.\n\nThe author's side is that the sister went too far, leading to family conflict and personal embarrassment. The sister's side is that she was retaliating for being pranked and humiliated first. The question is about proportionality. The initial prank caused crying, which is a strong reaction, but the sister's prank involved exposing private, adult material in a public family setting, which can have more lasting consequences. The author is now severing the relationship as a result of both pranks, but the user is pointing out that the sister's action was worse, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nHowever, cutting off a family member is a serious action. Even if the sister did something worse, the author's response of completely cutting off the sister might be seen as disproportionate. It depends on cultural context and the seriousness of the offense. If the author has younger siblings and the sister's action could have exposed them to inappropriate content, that's a valid concern. But the author's response is to stop all communication. The sister's prank was a direct retaliation, but the author's action of cutting off might prevent any possibility of reconciliation, especially if the sister is part of the family the author is trying to maintain a relationship with.\n\nAlso, the author's initial prank led to the sister's retaliation. So there's some mutual escalation. The sister's prank was more harmful, but the author's response is to cut off. The user argues the author isn't in the wrong because the sister's action was worse. The answer would need to consider both pranks and the consequences. The author did have the first prank, but the sister's retaliation was more severe. However, cutting off a family member is a major step. The answer would be B (No) because the sister's prank was worse, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off. The author's reaction is a form of retaliation too, so it's not clear if that's justified. But if the sister's prank was so severe it caused family issues, the author's decision might be seen as self-defense or protecting their reputation, but cutting off could be seen as harsh. However, given the context of mutual pranks and the sister's worse action, the author might not be the asshole here. So the answer is B.\n"
