I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation is that the author pranked their sister before by giving her a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to their family and a girl he was introducing. The author is feeling humiliated and cut off his sister.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both actions. The initial prank was an empty box with a brick, which caused emotional harm (crying). Then the sister's revenge involved revealing private items to family and a guest. The author is questioning if cutting off the sister is justified.\n\nIn the first instance, pranking someone in a way that hurts their feelings is generally considered crossing a line. The empty box with a brick is a classic prank, but if it made the sister cry, that's a problem. The key here is whether the prank was harmless or if it was cruel. The author might have thought it was a joke, but it had a negative impact.\n\nThen the sister's retaliation. Exposing private, adult content that someone collects is a significant violation of privacy. Even if the content isn't illegal, it's personal and the sister's action led to public embarrassment and family conflict. The author's reaction is understandable, but the question is about proportionality. The initial prank vs. the sister's action.\n\nThe author's response was to cut off the sister. Is that the wrong move? If the sister's prank was more severe, then maybe the author isn't the asshole. But the author had a history of pranking first. The sister might have felt justified in her revenge because of the prior prank. However, pranks can escalate, and crossing into exposing personal items is a big step. The author's collection, while adult, is his private property. The sister's action was a direct attack on his privacy and reputation, which is more serious than the initial prank.\n\nBut the author did initiate the prank. The sister's response was a form of retaliation. The question is whether the author's cutting off the sister is justified. The sister's action had real consequences, causing family embarrassment and potential damage to relationships. The author might feel that the sister overstepped, so cutting ties is a way to avoid further conflict. However, cutting off a sibling entirely after a prank war might be seen as extreme, even if the sister's prank was worse. The author could have addressed the issue without severing all contact.\n\nSo, while the sister definitely overstepped, the author's initial prank also hurt the sister. The response of cutting her off is harsh but perhaps not entirely the author's fault. The key is that both sides contributed to the escalation. But the sister's prank was more harmful. The author is in a difficult position, but cutting off the sister might be a reaction to protect their reputation. The community on AITA often considers both sides. The author might not be the asshole, but maybe they should have handled it differently. The sister's actions were worse, but the author's part in starting the prank war is part of it. However, the final answer is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the sister's prank had more severe consequences and the author was the one who started the prank war, maybe the sister is more at fault. The author's decision to cut her off is a response to her actions, but is it justified? The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
