I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. The original prank involved giving her a fake Xbox, which made her cry, and now the sister has retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family. The author is feeling humiliated and has decided to stop talking to her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's initial prank was a prank war, but it resulted in his sister crying. Then the sister, in her revenge, did something that caused even more harm. The key point here is whether the author's actions of cutting off the sister are justified given the context. \n\nThe sister's prank was more severe because it involved exposing private, potentially sensitive material in front of family and a guest. This could lead to lasting damage in the family's perception of the author. The sister might have overstepped, as the prank escalated beyond what's considered appropriate. \n\nThe author is now cutting off the sister. Is this the wrong move? Well, if the sister's action was indeed a significant violation that caused harm, the author might feel justified. However, cutting off a family member is a major step. The author should consider if there's a way to address the issue without completely severing communication. Maybe discussing boundaries would be better. \n\nBut the sister's prank was a direct retaliation, and she took it further than the initial prank. The original prank (fake Xbox) was a harmless joke that backfired, leading to the sister's emotional reaction. The sister then escalated by exposing his collection, which is personal and could be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nIn this case, the sister's actions are more harmful. The author's response, while harsh, is a reaction to a prank that crossed a personal line. However, the author also initiated the prank war. So, perhaps they both have some responsibility. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister's action was clearly more severe and violated the author's privacy, then the author cutting her off might be a reaction to protect themselves. The sister's prank was not just a joke but caused real emotional and social damage. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been at fault initially if their prank was too harsh, leading to the sister's revenge. But the sister's response was disproportionate. The original prank led to her crying, but the retaliation was exposing something private and causing embarrassment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister's action is worse because it involved exposing personal items in a public setting. The author's prank was a light-hearted joke that backfired. The author's decision to cut off the sister is a personal choice, but if the sister was being vindictive and overstepped, the author isn't necessarily the asshole here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The author did start the prank war, but the sister's response was way worse. The author's right to privacy and the emotional impact from the sister's action are significant. Cutting off communication might be a reaction to protect themselves, which is understandable even if the initial prank wasn't ideal. The sister was the one who escalated it beyond a reasonable prank. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
