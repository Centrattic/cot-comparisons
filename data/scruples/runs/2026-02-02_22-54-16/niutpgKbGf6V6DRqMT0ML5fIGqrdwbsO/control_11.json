I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. \n\nFirst, the initial situation: the author pranked their sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then, in retaliation, the sister exposed his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was introducing. The author now refuses to talk to her and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main points here are about mutual pranks and the escalation. The first prank (fake Xbox) led to the sister crying, which the author might have realized was too harsh. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection. The author is now cutting ties, but is that justified?\n\nI need to consider both sides. The initial prank might have been playful, but causing someone to cry is taking it too far. The sister's revenge was exposing sensitive material, which is a serious breach of privacy and trust. The author's response is cutting off contact. \n\nIn typical AITA discussions, intent and consequences matter. The author might feel wronged because the sister crossed a line, but the sister was retaliating for the initial prank. However, the sister's action was more harmful and public, potentially damaging the author's relationship with family and the girl. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting ties. If the sister's prank was worse, then the author's response might be justified. But if the author's initial prank was also wrong, maybe they both share blame. However, since the sister's action led to a more severe consequence, the author cutting off contact might not be the asshole here. \n\nAlso, the sister's action was a clear invasion of privacy. The author had a right to be upset. So the answer might lean towards B, the author not being in the wrong. But I need to check if cutting off a sibling is too harsh, even in retaliation. Sometimes in AITA, cutting off family over pranks is seen as extreme. However, the sister's prank was more severe. \n\nI think the key is that the sister overstepped by exposing private material, leading to family embarrassment. The author's response is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
