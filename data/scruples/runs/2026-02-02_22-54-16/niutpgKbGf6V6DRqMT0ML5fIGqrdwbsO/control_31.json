I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the user pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox with a brick inside, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his girl. The user is now cutting her off and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The initial prank caused emotional harm; the sister was made to cry. The user's prank was mean, even if it was part of a sibling rivalry. Then the sister's prank was worse because she exposed private adult material to the family, which is a serious invasion of privacy and caused public humiliation.\n\nThe user's response is to cut off the sister. The key here is whether cutting off is justified. The sister overstepped, but the user also initiated the prank that harmed their sister. However, the sister's retaliation escalated the situation to a much higher level. The user's action in cutting off the sister is a response to her exposing private things, which is a significant breach. \n\nIn terms of morality, both sides did something wrong. The user's prank was harmful, but the sister's retaliation was more severe. The user is now cutting off the sister to protect their reputation and privacy, which could be seen as reasonable. However, cutting off entirely might be seen as harsh, but the sister also crossed a line. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The sister's prank was worse, but the user's initial prank wasn't justified either. However, the user is responding to the sister's over-the-top retaliation. The community might see the sister's action as the bigger issue, so the user cutting off is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
