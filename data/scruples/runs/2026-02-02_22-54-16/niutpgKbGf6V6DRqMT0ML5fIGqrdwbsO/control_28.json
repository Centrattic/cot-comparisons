I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. So the user is asking if the author is the asshole for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. The situation involves two pranks. First, the author gave their sister a fake Xbox with a brick, which made her cry. Then, the sister took revenge by exposing his adult manga to the family in front of a girl he's interested in.\n\nHmm, the first prank sounds pretty harsh. Giving someone an empty box with a brick instead of a real Xbox would definitely be hurtful. The sister was upset enough to cry, so the author's prank might have been a bit too much. But then the sister retaliated by exposing his private collection. That's a big deal because it's not just a prank anymore; it's about privacy and respect.\n\nThe author is now cutting off their sister because of that. But was her prank justified? She did take it to a whole new level by exposing something personal in front of family and a potential girlfriend. That's a serious invasion of privacy. The author feels humiliated and is cutting her off as a result.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole for cutting her off. Well, the sister's prank was worse, but the author's initial prank was also harmful. However, the sister's retaliation went beyond just a prank. Exposing someone's private collection in front of others is a significant breach of trust and privacy. The author's response is to cut her off, which is understandable given the humiliation caused. \n\nBut was the author's original prank also a factor? The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister. Considering that the sister's prank escalated the situation, the author's decision to stop talking to her isn't entirely unreasonable. However, cutting someone off completely might be a harsh reaction, but given the context, maybe it's justified. \n\nI think the key here is that the sister's prank crossed a line, so the author isn't the asshole for cutting her off. The initial prank was bad, but the sister's retaliation was worse. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
