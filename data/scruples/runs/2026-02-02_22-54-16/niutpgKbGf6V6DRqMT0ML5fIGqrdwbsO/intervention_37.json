I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing their adult manga collection to the family in front of the author's girl. The author now feels humiliated and has cut off their sister. They're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions (cutting off the sister) are justified. Let's look at both sides.\n\nThe sister's prank was pretty harsh. Exposing something as personal as adult magazines, especially in front of family and a guest, is a significant violation of privacy. That could be seen as crossing a line. The author had already pranked her before, but the sister's retaliation escalated the situation. The author might feel that their privacy was invaded, and the sister overstepped.\n\nOn the other hand, the author initiated the prank war by giving the fake Xbox. While that might have been a prank, it was hurtful enough to make the sister cry. So maybe the author's initial prank wasn't harmless. However, the sister's response was much more severe and damaging. The author's decision to cut off contact could be a reaction to being publicly humiliated, which can be understandable.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for cutting off their sister? Well, cutting someone off can be a harsh response, but if the sister's actions were truly egregious and the author feels they can't reconcile, maybe it's a personal choice. The key points here are the severity of the pranks and the consequences. The sister's prank had lasting negative effects on the author's family relationships and personal reputation. The author's response was to stop communication, which might be seen as a way to protect themselves, not necessarily as being the asshole.\n\nHowever, some might argue that pranks should have limits, and the author's initial prank may have set the stage for the sister's retaliation. But the sister's actions were more malicious and had real consequences. The author's decision to cut her off is about self-respect and boundaries after being wronged.\n\nSo in this case, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The sister's prank was more harmful and crossed a line, so the author's response is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
