I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them in retaliation. The situation involves a cycle of pranks and escalating actions.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked the sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. The author is now cutting off the sister and asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to analyze both sides. The author's prank made his sister cry, which is hurtful. However, the sister's retaliation was more severe\u2014humiliating him in front of family and a girl. The author feels justified in cutting her off. \n\nLegally, there's no crime here, but morally, pranks can vary. The initial prank was cruel because it made the sister cry, which shows it went too far. The sister's response was worse, exposing private items. The author's decision to cut her off might be seen as self-defense after her severe prank. However, cutting someone off entirely is a big step. \n\nBut the sister's action was a significant breach of privacy and trust. The author's manga collection was personal, and exposing it caused real harm to his family relationships. The prank war escalated beyond harmless jokes. The sister's action crossed a line, so the author's response might be understandable. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the sister's prank is worse. So the author isn't in the wrong for cutting her off. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
