I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox with a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his collection of adult manga to the family in front of his friend. The author is upset and has cut off the sister, wondering if that's justified.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author's retaliation (cutting off the sister) is justified. The author feels wronged because the sister's prank was more severe. The sister's action was exposing personal items in front of family and a friend, which is a significant invasion of privacy and caused embarrassment. \n\nOn the other hand, the original prank (fake Xbox) made the sister cry, which isn't great, but it's a common prank. However, the sister's response escalated things by exposing something the author didn't want shared, especially with family. The author's response is to cut off the sister. \n\nNow, considering the \"Am I the Asshole\" context, the community usually looks at who overstepped. The sister's action seems more malicious and harmful, invading privacy and causing lasting damage. The author's prank, while hurtful, might be seen as a lighter transgression. The author cutting off the sister could be seen as self-defense after the more severe prank. \n\nBut is cutting off someone over a prank too harsh? Maybe, but if the sister crossed a line, then the author's response might be justified. The key is the severity of the pranks. The fake Xbox is a prank, but exposing personal items is a serious breach. So the author might not be the asshole here. \n\nI think the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. The sister's action was more harmful, and the author's response is a reaction to that. The initial prank was minor compared to the sister's retaliation.\n"
