I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a cycle of pranks between siblings.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick. That prank made her cry, which they admit was wrong. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family during a visit. The author feels this was a serious betrayal, leading to family embarrassment and the decision to cut ties.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks and the consequences. The initial prank (Xbox with a brick) was hurtful and crossed a line. The sister's retaliation was even more severe, exposing private and sensitive material. The author is now cutting off their sister, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nLegally, neither is wrong for pranking unless it causes physical harm or legal issues. However, the moral aspect is different. The author's first prank caused emotional harm, which they acknowledge. The sister's response escalated the situation to a public humiliation. The author's reaction of cutting off the sister is a decision to end the relationship, which is their choice, but the question is about being in the wrong.\n\nThe author might argue self-defense against the sister's overreaction, but the initial prank was their fault. Still, the sister's action was the straw that broke the camel's back. The author's decision to cut off the sister is a consequence of the sister's actions. However, the author's own prank was a contributing factor. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be seen as partly at fault for starting the prank war, but the sister's response was more damaging. The author is now choosing to cut ties, which is their right, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the sister's action was more severe and the author is reacting to a betrayal that caused lasting damage. The initial prank was their fault, but the sister crossed a line, making the author's decision to cut her off understandable. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
