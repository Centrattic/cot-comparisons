I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The original Reddit post is about a person who pranked their sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit from a girl he's interested in. The author is cutting off their sister and is wondering if they're the asshole for doing so, comparing the pranks.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the actions of both parties. The author first pranked the sister with a brick in a box, leading to her crying. Then the sister waited for a chance to get back at him. When the author had a girl over, the sister took a risky move to expose his private collection in front of the family and the girl. The author is cutting off contact, feeling wronged.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethics here. Pranks can be harmless, but when they cause emotional harm, like making someone cry, that's problematic. The initial prank by the author caused emotional distress. The sister's retaliation was more severe, invading the author's privacy and exposing his personal items in a family setting. That's a significant invasion of privacy and could lead to lasting damage to relationships.\n\nThe key here is the escalation. The author started a prank war, but the sister took it to a level that crossed into personal violation. The author's response is cutting off contact, which is a personal choice. However, is the author in the wrong? Well, they initiated the prank that caused harm. The sister's retaliation was worse, but does that mean the author's decision to cut her off is justified?\n\nI think the sister's actions are more egregious because she violated the author's privacy in a way that caused public humiliation. The author's initial prank, while mean, didn't have the same level of impact. So, when the sister went over the top, the author's decision to cut her off isn't the wrong choice. The author is not in the wrong here because the sister escalated the situation to a harmful level. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
