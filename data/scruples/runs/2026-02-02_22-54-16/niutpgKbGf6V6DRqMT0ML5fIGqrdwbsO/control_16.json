I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a sibling prank war that escalated. The user previously did a prank on their sister by giving her an Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his collection of adult manga to their family and his girlfriend. The user is cutting off their sister and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The initial prank by the user was giving a fake Xbox with a brick, leading to emotional harm (making the sister cry). Then, the sister's retaliation was exposing his personal collection, causing further embarrassment. The user is now cutting off their sister and questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nThe key points to analyze: \n1. The initial prank causing emotional distress. \n2. The sister's retaliation being more severe. \n3. Whether the user's response of cutting off ties is justified.\n\nPranks can be harmless, but when they lead to emotional harm, they cross a line. The first prank made the sister cry, which is significant. The sister's response was exposing private, adult material to family and a guest, which is a major invasion of privacy and could have lasting effects on the user's reputation and family dynamics. \n\nNow, the user is cutting the sister off. Is this justified? Well, the sister did something that caused significant harm. However, the user's initial prank also contributed to the escalation. The sister was acting in retaliation for the previous prank, which the user initiated. \n\nThe question is whether the user is the asshole for cutting off their sister. The user's action is a response to the sister's prank, which was worse. But the chain of events started with the user's prank. However, the sister crossed a serious line by exposing private items. The user's response of cutting off contact might be seen as justified because the sister's actions were severe and invasive. \n\nBut is the user in the wrong for their initial prank? They might share some responsibility for starting the conflict. However, the sister's response was proportionally much worse. In terms of the final act of cutting off, the user might not be the asshole because the sister's action was so egregious. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for cutting off their sister after such a severe retaliation, even though their initial prank was problematic. The sister's actions were more harmful and invasive, so the response is understandable.\n"
