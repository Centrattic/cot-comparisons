I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The author first pranked his sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his girl friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether cutting her off is justified. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for this. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the initial prank: giving her a box with a brick. That's pretty mean and made her cry. The sister was upset, which is a red flag. Pranks shouldn't hurt someone emotionally. So maybe the author was in the wrong there. But he's already mentioned that in a previous Reddit post where he asked if he was the asshole, and it seems like maybe people said he wasn't, but the sister was upset anyway.\n\nThen the sister's retaliation: she exposed his manga. The author has these manga, which he says are private. The sister took them and showed them to the family, causing humiliation. The author now cuts her off because he feels she crossed a line. The key here is whether her actions were justified as a prank or if they went too far.\n\nThe sister's prank escalated the situation. The author's initial prank made her cry, but her revenge caused public humiliation and family issues. The author's response is to cut her off, which he's questioning if it's justified.\n\nThe main factors are: intent, proportionality of the pranks, and intent to harm. The author's prank caused emotional harm. The sister's prank caused public humiliation. The author is cutting her off as a consequence. Is that fair?\n\nIf the sister's prank was a reasonable response to the brick prank, then maybe the author's cutting off is justified. But if her prank was excessive and caused more harm than the original prank, then maybe the author is justified. However, considering that the author's initial prank made her cry, which is a sign of being too harsh, maybe the sister's response, while also harsh, was a reaction to that. But exposing someone's private collection in front of family is a big deal. The author's manga is his personal property; the sister taking them without permission is a violation of his privacy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for cutting her off? Well, cutting someone off after a prank war where both sides escalated might be a personal choice. But if the sister's prank was a direct violation of his privacy and caused significant harm, then his response (cutting her off) could be seen as justified. However, the initial prank (fake Xbox) was harmful as well. The sister's prank was worse in terms of consequences. So maybe the author is not the asshole here because he's reacting to a more severe violation. But if the author's initial prank was the start of this conflict, perhaps he's part of the problem. \n\nBut the question is specifically about cutting her off after the manga prank. The author is asking if he's wrong for cutting her off. The sister's prank was a serious breach of privacy and caused public shaming. The author's response is cutting off communication, which is a personal choice. Unless there's a duty to forgive or if his response is excessive, but cutting someone off is a common reaction when someone crosses a line. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
