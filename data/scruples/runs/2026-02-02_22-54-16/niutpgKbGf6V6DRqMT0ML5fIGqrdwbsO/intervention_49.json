I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. \n\nFirst, there's the initial prank where the author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. The sister was upset and it made her cry. The author felt they were too smart to be pranked but now the sister got revenge.\n\nThen, the sister took some adult manga books and exposed them to the family in front of the guy's friend. The guy is embarrassed, his mom is upset, and the family dynamics are affected. The guy now refuses to talk to his sister anymore.\n\nThe key points here are: the initial prank was bad, but the sister escalated it by exposing his private collection, which is more personal and could cause lasting damage. The guy is defending his right to privacy and feeling that the sister overstepped. \n\nI need to consider if cutting off the sister is a justified response. Pranks can be playful, but when they cross into causing emotional harm or public embarrassment, they might be considered inconsiderate. The sister's action was more severe, as it involved private items and family. The author's retaliation after being pranked again might be seen as a reasonable response to protect their reputation. \n\nHowever, the author's own prank (Xbox with a brick) was also a form of retaliation. The sister's prank was in response to the author's, so maybe the cycle of pranks is at fault. But the author's sister took it to a level that's harder to forgive, especially if it led to significant family repercussions. The author might feel justified in setting a boundary here, even if the initial prank was their idea. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily the asshole for cutting off the sister after she escalated things. The sister's action was more invasive and damaging. The author's decision to stop communication could be a way to protect themselves. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
