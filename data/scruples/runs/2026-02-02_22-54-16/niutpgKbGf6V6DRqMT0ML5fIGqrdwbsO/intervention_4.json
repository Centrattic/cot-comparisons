I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a series of pranks between siblings.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox that was actually a brick. This prank made her cry. Then, as retaliation, the sister exposed the author's collection of adult manga to the family during a visit. The author is now cutting off the sister, feeling wronged. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The initial prank by the author led to the sister crying, which is harsh. The sister's retaliation involved exposing the author's private collection, which is also invasive and damaging. The author is now cutting off the sister. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, both pranks are harmful, but the sister's action had more severe consequences, potentially affecting the author's family relationships. The author's decision to cut off the sister might be seen as a reaction to the more severe prank. However, revenge cycles can be problematic. But given the context, the sister's action escalated things significantly. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Considering the sister's action was more invasive and damaging, the author's response could be justified. However, cutting someone off entirely might be seen as extreme, but given the situation, it's understandable. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
