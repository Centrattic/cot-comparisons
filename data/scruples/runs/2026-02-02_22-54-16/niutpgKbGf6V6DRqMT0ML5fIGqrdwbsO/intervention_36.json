I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who cut off their sister after a prank is in the wrong. The situation involves a cycle of pranks between siblings.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister with an empty Xbox box containing a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. The author now feels humiliated and has cut off communication with his sister.\n\nI need to consider the context of their actions. Pranks can escalate quickly. The initial prank (Xbox box with a brick) was hurtful, leading to emotional distress. The sister's response was exposing personal items, which is more invasive and damaging. The author's decision to cut her off might be seen as a reaction to this escalation.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's response is justified. Cutting off a sibling is a significant action, but if the sister crossed a line by exposing personal and sensitive material, especially in front of others, the author's reaction might be understandable. However, the author's initial prank also caused harm, which complicates things.\n\nBut the sister's action was much more severe in terms of consequences\u2014family relationships are at stake, and the author feels his reputation is ruined. The prank war escalated beyond harmless jokes. The author might feel justified in cutting her off to protect himself from further harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's revenge was a direct response to the author's prank, so maybe the author should have considered the potential for escalation and maybe de-escalated the situation instead of continuing the prank war. However, given the significant humiliation caused by the sister, the author's decision to stop communication might be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the sister's action was a severe breach, especially involving family and personal items. But it's a bit of a gray area. The initial prank was bad, but the sister's retaliation was worse. The author's response is a reaction to the worst part of the cycle. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
