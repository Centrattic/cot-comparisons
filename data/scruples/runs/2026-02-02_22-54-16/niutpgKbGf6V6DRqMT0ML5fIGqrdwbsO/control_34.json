I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. Let's start by looking at the context.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her a brick inside an Xbox box, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's interested in. The author is upset about the humiliation and has decided to cut off contact with his sister. The question is whether he's the asshole for doing so, considering the prior pranks.\n\nI need to analyze both sides. The sister's action was definitely more harmful. Exposing someone's private collection in front of family and a potential romantic interest is a serious breach of trust and privacy. It can lead to long-term family tension and personal humiliation. The author's prank, while hurtful, didn't cause the same level of lasting damage. The sister escalated the situation by taking it further than just a prank\u2014she invaded his privacy and exposed his personal items, which is a significant overstep.\n\nHowever, the author's response of cutting off contact entirely might be seen as extreme. While the sister's actions were worse, completely severing all communication could be viewed as disproportionate unless there's a history of ongoing abuse. The author might need to consider if this is a one-time incident or part of a pattern. If it's a one-time retaliation, cutting off contact might be harsh, but if there's a history of such pranks and the sister's actions were particularly malicious, it's more justified.\n\nAlso, the author's initial prank made the sister cry, which indicates that the pranks were not harmless. The sister's retaliation was more severe, but the author's response is a form of self-defense in terms of protecting their personal space and privacy. The key here is whether the sister's action crossed a line beyond playful teasing into something harmful and invasive. Since she did expose his private collection, which could have lasting social and family repercussions, the author's decision to cut her off might be understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author should consider if there's a way to address the issue without cutting off all contact. Maybe a temporary break or having a conversation to set boundaries. But given the severity of the sister's actions and the fact that it affected his standing with the family and a romantic interest, the author's reaction isn't entirely unreasonable.\n\nIn terms of Reddit's AITA format, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The sister's intent was clearly to humiliate in a way that went beyond a prank, while the author's response is a reaction to protect himself. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
