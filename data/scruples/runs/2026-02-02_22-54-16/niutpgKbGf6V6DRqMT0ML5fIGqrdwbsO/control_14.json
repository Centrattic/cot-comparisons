I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a series of pranks between siblings, starting with the author giving their sister an empty Xbox box. The sister retaliated by exposing the author's manga collection to the family and a girl who was over.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The author's initial prank caused the sister to cry, which is already problematic. Then the sister's prank was more severe, leading to public humiliation. The author is now cutting off the sister, and the question is whether this is justified.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks. The first prank might have been harmless, but the sister's retaliation took a serious turn by exposing the author's private belongings in front of family and a guest. The author's response is to cut off the sister, which seems like a consequence she's willing to face because of the embarrassment caused.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to consider intent and impact. The sister's action was intentional and crossed a boundary by exposing private items, which is more harmful than the initial prank. The author, on the other hand, while starting the prank war, took the sister's action as a betrayal, leading to cutting off communication. \n\nHowever, cutting someone off is a significant step. Even if the sister's actions were worse, the author's decision to stop all contact might be seen as a mature response to protect their reputation and mental well-being, especially after the trauma of public exposure. Alternatively, some might argue that cutting off family is extreme, regardless of the provocation.\n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's prank was more severe and invasive. The author's reaction, while punitive, is a response to a more serious transgression. So the author is not necessarily in the wrong for cutting off the sister, especially since the sister escalated the situation beyond a simple prank.\n"
