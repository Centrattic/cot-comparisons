I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and their sister. The author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to their family when a girl was over. The author is now cutting off the sister and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, pranks can be a gray area. The initial prank by the author involved making the sister cry, which is pretty harsh. But the sister's retaliation was much more severe: exposing personal, sensitive material in front of family and a girl the author was trying to impress. The author argues that their prank was justified as retaliation, but the sister's action was much worse.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the harm caused. The author's prank led to emotional distress, but the sister's prank had significant social and familial consequences. The author's collection, while perhaps not illegal, is private and exposing them without consent is a breach of privacy. The sister's action was a direct attack on the author's reputation and standing with the family.\n\nHowever, the author's response is to cut off the sister entirely. Is that a fair reaction? It's a form of retaliation, but cutting off communication completely after a single incident might be excessive, even if the incident was hurtful. The question is whether the author's actions (prank and then cutting off the sister) are proportionate.\n\nThe original prank (Xbox box) was cruel, but the sister's prank was more damaging. The author's response of cutting off the sister might be seen as a proportional reaction to the severe harm caused, especially if the sister's action was a direct retaliation. However, some might argue that both sides escalated things and that the author should take responsibility for starting the prank war. But given the sister's more severe action, the author's decision to cut her off might be understandable. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
