I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she exposed his adult manga collection to the family during a visit by a girl he's interested in. The situation has a history: the author previously pranked his sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick. She retaliated by exposing his private collection in front of the family and the girl.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The author's initial prank involved deception but didn't cause severe harm, though it made the sister cry. The sister's response was to expose sensitive personal items in front of family and a potential romantic interest, leading to embarrassment and family tension. \n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks and the appropriateness of each action. The author's prank was a joke, but the sister's response crossed into invading his privacy and causing significant emotional and familial damage. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. Legally, there's no wrongdoing, but morally, it's about the proportionality of the pranks. The sister's action was more harmful and invasive. The author's decision to cut her off is a response to her crossing a line. However, the author also initiated the prank war. But since the sister's action was more severe, the author's response might be justified. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author is not the asshole here. The sister's action was worse, so cutting her off is a reasonable step. Answer B.\n"
