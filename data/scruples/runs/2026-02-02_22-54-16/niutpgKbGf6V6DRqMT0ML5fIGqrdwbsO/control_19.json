I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister for a prank. First, I need to break down the situation. \n\nThe author previously pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox with a brick inside, which made her cry. Now, the sister is retaliating by exposing his collection of adult manga to their family in front of a girl he's interested in. The author is upset, felt humiliated, and has decided to cut her off. He's questioning if this is justified.\n\nSo, the main points here are the initial prank and the sister's revenge. The author's action was a prank that caused emotional harm (crying), which is a problem. Then the sister took a significant step by exposing his private collection. The family's reaction is now affecting the author's relationships. \n\nI need to consider the balance of who started it and the escalating nature. Pranks can be a form of playful teasing, but when they cause real emotional pain, they cross a line. The author's prank was harmful, but the sister's response was even more severe. She revealed private items that are considered inappropriate for the family setting. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. The key is to evaluate if the author's actions were a reasonable response. The initial prank was a joke, but the sister's action was a serious violation of privacy. The author might feel like he's being punished for something that was a joke, but the sister's retaliation was much more damaging. \n\nHowever, cutting someone off completely after a prank might be seen as overreacting. But in this case, the sister took it further. The author's response (cutting off) is a direct consequence of the sister's action. The sister stepped over the line by exposing his private collection, which is a big deal. \n\nOn the other hand, the author should reflect on his own prank. Maybe the sister felt the need to retaliate because the first prank was hurtful. But even if that's the case, her revenge was extreme. The author's decision to cut her off might be justified given the context. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might have acted inconsiderately, but the sister's action had more severe consequences. The author's initial prank was a harmless joke, but the sister's response was a serious breach of privacy. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for cutting her off. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The sister's action was worse, but the author's cutting off is a reaction to that. The question is about the current situation, not the past. The sister exposed his stuff, causing family issues. The author is cutting her off as a result. Is that justified? \n\nIn this context, the sister's action was a clear violation of privacy and caused significant embarrassment. The author's response, while cutting off communication, is a natural reaction to being publicly shamed. The sister's prank was worse than the initial one, so the author's response might be seen as a justified self-defense after the sister overstepped. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
