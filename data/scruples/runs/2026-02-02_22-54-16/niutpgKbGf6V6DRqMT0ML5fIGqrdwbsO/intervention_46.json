I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she exposed his adult manga collection. \n\nFirst, the context: The author previously pranked his sister by giving her a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, she retaliated by exposing his private collection to the family in front of a girl he's seeing. The author is cutting her off because he feels this was a severe betrayal.\n\nThe key points here are the escalating pranks. The author's prank led to emotional distress (crying), and the sister's revenge was even more invasive, affecting his family's perception and his relationship. He feels justified in cutting her off as a response to crossing a line. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, both actions were pranks, but the sister's action was public humiliation and invasion of privacy. The author's initial prank was a prank that caused crying, which isn't ideal. However, the sister's retaliation was more severe and had lasting consequences. The author's response is cutting her off, which is a personal choice. \n\nConsidering the severity of the sister's action versus the initial prank, the author might feel justified. But the prank he started could be seen as the catalyst. However, the sister's action was more harmful. So the author isn't necessarily the asshole here. The answer might be B, but I need to check if the author's response is proportionate. Cutting off a sibling is a big move, but if the sister crossed a line, maybe it's acceptable. The question is whether the author's actions (prank and then cutting off) make him the asshole. The prank that made her cry is questionable, but the sister's retaliation was worse. So the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
