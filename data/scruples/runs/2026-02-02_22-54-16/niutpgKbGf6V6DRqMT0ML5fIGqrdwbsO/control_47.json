I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sibling prank war that escalated. The user did a prank where they gave their sister an Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his friend. The user is asking if cutting off the sister is justified.\n\nFirst, let's break down the actions. The user's initial prank involved deception and caused emotional harm (the sister cried). The sister's retaliation was exposing something personal and potentially embarrassing for the user. The key here is whether the sister crossed a line that the user's prank didn't.\n\nThe user's prank was a prank that caused emotional distress. The sister's prank was exposing private, personal items in front of family and a friend, which could have lasting social consequences. The user is now cutting off the sister because of this. \n\nNow, considering the context: pranks are sometimes playful, but there's a line when they cause significant harm. The user's prank led to tears, which is a red flag. The sister's prank was more invasive, exposing personal items in a public (family) setting. The user's reaction is to cut off the sister, which is a severe consequence. \n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, the initial prank that caused the sister to seek revenge was harmful. The sister's retaliation was a significant invasion of privacy. However, the user's response of cutting off the sister could be seen as a justified reaction to the violation of privacy. But since the user started the prank war, maybe they bear some responsibility for the escalation. However, the sister's action was more severe. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user might be in the right to cut off the sister because the sister's prank was a serious breach. But the user also initiated the conflict. However, the sister's action was worse. So perhaps the user isn't the asshole here. The answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
