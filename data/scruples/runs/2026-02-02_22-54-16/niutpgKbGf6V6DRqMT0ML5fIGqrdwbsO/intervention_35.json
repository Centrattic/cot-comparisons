I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. The situation involves a prank war that escalated.\n\nFirst, the initial prank: the author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. The sister was upset and cried. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's manga collection to the family and a girl they were introducing. The author is now cutting off the sister and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the escalation of pranks and the consequences. The author did a prank that hurt their sister emotionally. Then the sister took a prank that went way beyond the initial prank, causing significant embarrassment and family issues. The author is cutting off the sister after this.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions might be considered self-defense after the sister's severe retaliation. Pranks are typically meant to be lighthearted, but when they cross into emotional harm or public humiliation, it's a different story. The sister's prank had long-term effects, damaging the author's reputation with the family and others. \n\nThe author might feel justified in cutting off the sister because the sister's prank was more harmful and crossed a personal boundary. However, the author's initial prank also caused emotional distress, so there's a prior action that's not innocent.\n\nBut the sister's response was more severe. Pranks should generally be mutual and not cause lasting harm. The sister's action was more about revenge and hurt rather than a simple joke. The author's decision to cut off the sister could be seen as necessary to stop further harm. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that both parties were at fault because pranks can be a cycle. However, the sister's prank had real consequences, and the author's reaction is a break rather than a prank. So, the author's action is a reaction to a more serious offense, which might make them not the asshole.\n"
