I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister with an empty Xbox box, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's interested in. The author is cutting her off now because he feels humiliated and that his family's opinion of him has changed.\n\nThe key points here are the pranks and the aftermath. The initial prank (Xbox box with a brick) led to emotional distress for the sister. Then the sister's retaliation was more severe, involving the family and the girl. The author is now cutting off the sister, and the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's prank made his sister cry, which is not great. But the sister's prank was more damaging, invading his privacy and causing family issues. The author is cutting her off as a response to this severe retaliation. \n\nIs cutting someone off ever justified? If the sister crossed a line, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the author initiated the prank war, so maybe he shares some responsibility. But the sister's action was worse. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, pointing out that the sister's prank was on a different level.\n\nAlso, the author's family is upset, and the girl is mocking him. The sister's action had lasting consequences. The author might feel justified in cutting her off after she escalated things. \n\nBut the initial prank was also mean, leading to crying. Maybe the author should have stopped the prank war earlier. However, the sister's response was significantly worse. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister definitely went too far. The author's response of cutting her off could be seen as self-defense after her severe prank. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
