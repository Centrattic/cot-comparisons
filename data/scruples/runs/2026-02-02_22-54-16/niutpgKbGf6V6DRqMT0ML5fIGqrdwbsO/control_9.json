I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves two pranks: the first was the author giving a fake Xbox with a brick, which made the sister cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga to the family in front of a girl he was seeing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the pranks. The initial prank was an empty Xbox box with a brick. That seems like a fairly standard prank, maybe a bit harsh if it made her cry, but not necessarily the worst. The sister's retaliation was exposing the author's private collection, which is a significant invasion of privacy and could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe author then cuts off their sister. The key here is whether the sister's prank was so severe that the author's response is justified. The sister's action was public and could have long-term family repercussions, especially involving the author's reputation. The author's response is to stop talking to her, which is a form of cutting off, but is that the right approach?\n\nAlso, the author was the one who started the prank war. The sister was retaliating. The question is whether the author's initial prank and the sister's response make the author the asshole for cutting her off. The author is now punishing the sister for the revenge, but since the sister was responding to the initial prank, maybe the author bears some responsibility for escalating the situation. \n\nHowever, the sister's prank was more invasive and harmful. Exposing someone's private collection in front of family and a potential romantic interest is a major betrayal. The author might feel justified in cutting off the sister, especially since the sister overstepped. It's a matter of whether the author's response is proportional. The sister crossed a line, so the author cutting her off could be seen as a reasonable reaction, not necessarily making the author the asshole. \n\nBut there's also the fact that the author initiated the prank that led to this situation. The sister was retaliating, so maybe the author should have considered the consequences of their initial prank. However, the sister's response was extreme, so the author's cutting off might be justified. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the sister's prank was worse, even though the author started it. The cutting off is a response to the sister's overstep, not the initial prank. So the author's action is a reaction to the sister's more severe prank, making them not the asshole.\n"
