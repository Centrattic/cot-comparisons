I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank war between siblings and an escalated conflict.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked his sister by giving her a brick instead of an Xbox, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to his family and a girl he was seeing. The author is cutting off contact with his sister and is questioning if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, I need to analyze both sides. The author's initial prank was pretty harsh, leading to his sister crying. That's a strong action. Then the sister's revenge involved exposing his private collection in front of family and a girl he's interested in. That's a significant invasion of privacy and caused public humiliation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. From a general perspective, pranks should be light-hearted and not cause serious harm. The author's initial prank had emotional consequences. The sister's retaliation was more damaging, invading privacy and causing long-term family tension. \n\nThe author's response is cutting off contact, which is a personal choice. But is he the asshole? The key here is whether the initial prank and the subsequent retaliation are on the same level. The sister's action crossed a line by exposing private items, which is more harmful than the initial prank. The author's cutting off might be justified given the sister's severe action. However, the author initiated the prank war, which started the conflict. \n\nBut the sister's retaliation was disproportionate and invasive. The author's response is a defense of his privacy and reputation. So, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong because the sister's action was more egregious. However, starting the prank could be a point against him. But the more serious issue is the sister's breach of privacy. So, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as the sister's action was worse.\n"
