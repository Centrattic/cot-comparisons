I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings, starting with the author giving a fake Xbox to their sister, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's seeing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The initial prank by the author was meant as a joke but ended up making the sister cry. That's not great, but pranks among siblings can vary in severity. However, the sister's retaliation was more harmful. She exposed private material to the family, which caused significant embarrassment and strained family relationships. The author now wants to cut off contact with the sister, which is their choice, but the question is whether they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The key points here are the escalation of pranks and the intent behind them. The sister's action was more invasive and damaging. Pranks should be mutual in terms of harm, but if one side crosses a line, it's hard to justify continuing the prank war. The author's sister went beyond a typical prank by invading privacy and causing lasting family tension. The author's decision to cut off contact is a reaction to this, which could be seen as justified given the harm caused.\n\nHowever, the author's initial prank also contributed to the conflict. But in terms of severity, the sister's action was worse. The author isn't the one who escalated it to a point of causing emotional harm and public embarrassment. So in this context, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting off the sister after such a harmful prank. The key is that while both sides engaged in pranks, the sister's action was more egregious, making the author's reaction understandable.\n"
