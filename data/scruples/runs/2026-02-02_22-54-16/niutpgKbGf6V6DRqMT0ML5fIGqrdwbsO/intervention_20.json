I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves two pranks: the first was the author giving their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. The sister then retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family when a girl was visiting. The author is now cutting off their sister and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The original prank (Xbox with a brick) was clearly hurtful and made the sister cry. That's a significant issue because it's not just a joke but something that can cause emotional distress. The sister's reaction to that prank might have been to seek revenge, which she did by revealing the adult content. But the author had a right to privacy, especially with personal items. The sister's action of exposing the magazines in front of the family during a sensitive time (when a girl was over) seems like a major transgression. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister. The author's actions led to the initial prank, which caused harm. The sister's retaliation was more severe, but does that make the author justified in cutting her off? The author might argue self-defense in the prank war, but cutting off all communication is a harsh response. It's possible that the author's prank was the catalyst, so maybe they share some responsibility. \n\nBut the sister's action was a direct violation of privacy with lasting consequences. The author's decision to cut off the sister could be seen as a reaction to a serious breach, not just retaliation. If the sister's prank escalated the situation beyond a typical prank, then the author's response might be understandable. However, cutting off a sibling entirely seems extreme unless there's a pattern of abuse. \n\nI should also think about the Reddit community's typical take on these situations. They often look at intent and whether the actions were reasonable. The sister's intent was clearly to humiliate, which is worse than the initial prank. The author's privacy was invaded, leading to family embarrassment. The sister crossed a line, so the author cutting her off after that might be justified as a form of self-protection. \n\nBut maybe the author shouldn't have pulled the prank in the first place, leading to the sister's retaliation. However, the sister's response was disproportionate and harmful. The key here is whether the author's subsequent cutting off is the right move. If the sister's action was a direct consequence of the author's prank, the author might feel they're being punished for their own initial mistake. But the sister's act was more about malice and violating privacy. \n\nSo, the author's prank was bad, but the sister's response was worse. The author cutting off the sister is their way of dealing with the aftermath. However, cutting someone off completely can have its own issues, like damaging family relationships. But given the context of the sister's harmful action, the author might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
