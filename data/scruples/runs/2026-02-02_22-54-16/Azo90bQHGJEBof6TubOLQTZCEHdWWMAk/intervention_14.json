Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a guy who's dating a girl in Europe, specifically Denmark. They found out she's pregnant, and she initially said she couldn't get pregnant because she has PCOS. Now, she's considering an abortion but seems to be dragging her feet, and there's some conflict about whether they can handle a child right now.\n\nFirst, the author is asking if he's at fault for telling her to get an abortion. The user thinks he's not in the wrong. Let's break this down. The woman had been telling him she couldn't get pregnant, which later turns out not to be entirely accurate since she did get pregnant. Now she's revealed a past pregnancy, which the author sees as a red flag. She's been slow in the abortion process, leading to a surgical procedure, and uses vulgar language about it. She's also been questioning his reasons for not wanting the baby, and he's worried about their ability to support a child financially and emotionally.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting an abortion. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, which she's already passed into the surgical stage. The woman seems to be making decisions that delay the process, which the author attributes to her hesitation. He also points out that she didn't reschedule after the initial appointment because she wanted to check his stance again. \n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect: whether it's the author's place to make that decision. In many relationships, both partners might have to agree on such major decisions, but ultimately, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. The author is expressing his stance, which is valid, but the final decision should be hers. However, he's also pointing out that she might have misled him about her fertility. \n\nBut the main question is if he's in the wrong. The author isn't forcing her to abort, just expressing his view. However, the way he's presenting it, he's not in agreement and is possibly pressuring her. The key here is that the woman is the one who has the medical procedure, and the author can't make that decision for her. So, he's not in the wrong in terms of having his opinion, but he might be in the wrong if he's pressuring her without considering her autonomy. However, the scenario seems more like he's stating his position rather than forcing her. \n\nThe woman's actions, like delaying the process and using vulgar language, might indicate she's conflicted. The author's frustration is understandable given her previous statements and the circumstances. But does that make him wrong? Probably not. He's sharing his perspective based on their situation. The woman is the one who needs to decide, and the author's role is to support her, but he's clearly stating that he's not ready for a child, which is his right. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's expressing his valid concerns and not making the decision for her. The woman's actions and decisions are her own, and while there's conflict, the author isn't at fault for his stance.\n"
