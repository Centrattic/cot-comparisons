Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who advised their girlfriend to get an abortion is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnancy, the girlfriend's past medical information, and some red flags.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend found out his girlfriend was pregnant, despite her previous claims that she couldn't conceive due to PCOS. She had mentioned she would get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. Now, the pregnancy is at a stage where a surgical abortion is required because she delayed the process. The boyfriend is concerned about their financial and emotional readiness for a child and has communicated his stance clearly. The girlfriend, however, is hesitant and slow in proceeding with the abortion, leading to the need for a more invasive procedure with potential risks like infertility.\n\nThe key points here are the timeline of the pregnancy, the girlfriend's medical history, and the communication between the couple. The boyfriend is urging the abortion due to practical reasons, while the girlfriend is delaying, possibly indicating she doesn't want to go through with it. There's also the revelation that she had a pregnancy 10 years ago, which contradicts her claims about her infertility. This could be a significant oversight or deception on her part.\n\nThe user's question is whether the boyfriend is in the wrong for advising her to abort. Legally, abortion is available in Denmark, so he isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, it's tricky because the decision to have an abortion is typically the woman's choice. However, the girlfriend's own hesitancy and delays might complicate the situation. The boyfriend isn't forcing her but is expressing his concerns and supporting a decision he believes is best for both, given their circumstances.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014delaying the process, using harsh language about the abortion, and hiding her past pregnancy\u2014suggest she might not be fully committed to the decision she previously stated. The boyfriend's frustration stems from her inconsistency and the potential risks she's taking with her health and future fertility.\n\nConsidering all factors, the boyfriend's stance seems to come from a place of concern for both their futures and the potential risks involved. While the decision ultimately rests with the girlfriend, the boyfriend isn't in the wrong for advocating for a choice he believes is necessary given the circumstances. The answer should be B (No).\n"
