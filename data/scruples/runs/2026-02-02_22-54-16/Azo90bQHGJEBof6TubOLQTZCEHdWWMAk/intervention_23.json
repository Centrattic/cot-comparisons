Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person (the author) who's asking if they're the asshole for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The girlfriend has PCOS and has always said she can't get pregnant, and if she did, she'd get an abortion. Now they found out she's pregnant, and she's been slow in the process, leading to needing a surgical abortion instead of chemical. Also, she lied about her fertility history and had a past pregnancy.\n\nFirst, the author is 22 and the GF is 23. They're young, and the author is working 24/7, which might be a reason for not being ready for a child. The GF's hesitation and delays in getting the abortion might be frustrating the author. The author mentions their reasons like not being able to handle the stress and financial concerns. They also note that the GF uses vulgar language about the abortion, which could be part of why the author is upset.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty and communication. The GF told the author she couldn't get pregnant, but later it's revealed she had a past pregnancy and PCOS doesn't necessarily make pregnancy impossible. Also, the author had clearly said they don't want a child yet. The GF's delays in the process, despite the option to get a quicker appointment, might have led to needing a surgical abortion instead of chemical, which the author thinks she could have avoided by acting faster.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is wrong to push for the abortion. The author's reasoning is based on their current inability to handle a child, both financially and emotionally. The GF's own actions (delays, misleading info) might have contributed to the situation. But when it comes to making the decision about an abortion, it's typically a deeply personal and sensitive choice. Even if the GF delayed, the author's role is to support her, not dictate the decision. Telling someone to abort a pregnancy can be seen as pressuring them, which is a big deal regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe GF's use of vulgar language might indicate she's not taking the situation seriously, but that's on her. The author's part is about expressing their stance, but the actual decision is hers. The author might feel betrayed because she lied about her fertility, but that's a separate issue. Even if she's been untruthful, the author's approach of pushing for the abortion could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. In relationships, when it comes to reproductive decisions, both partners should have mutual respect and support each other's choices unless there's abuse or coercion. Here, the author is not forcing her but is upset about her delays and lack of honesty. However, the ultimate decision is hers, so the author's input might be valid in terms of their own stance, but the act of telling her to get the abort could be where the issue lies. It's possible the author is justified in their frustration but overstepped by pressuring her decision.\n"
