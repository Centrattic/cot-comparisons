Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation involves several factors: the girlfriend has PCOS, was pregnant before, and there's some inconsistency in her medical history. The author feels she misrepresented her fertility and hesitated in the abortion process, leading to needing a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that he wants to abort because they aren't ready for a child. He lists reasons like his work schedule, financial stress, and her current welfare status. He also mentions she was slow in the process, leading to a more invasive abortion. \n\nThe girlfriend's side is that she's been clear about her stance on abortion from the start, but now she's hesitating. She didn't get immediate medical attention, delayed the process, and there's a history she didn't disclose (pregnancy 10 years ago). The author feels betrayed because she didn't mention the past pregnancy and now is taking longer than necessary.\n\nLegally, in Denmark, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks, and the method depends on the gestational age. The girlfriend's delay pushed her to week 8, requiring surgery. The author is upset she didn't act faster, leading to a more complicated procedure.\n\nEthically, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring her to abort. The girlfriend's autonomy is a key point here. Even though the author doesn't want the child, the decision should ideally be mutual. However, the girlfriend was hesitant and didn't act promptly, which the author sees as using his trust. Also, she misrepresented her medical history by claiming she couldn't get pregnant when she had been pregnant before and no doctor confirmed the PCOS as an infertility issue.\n\nThe author's stance is that he made his position clear, and she didn't take it seriously. He's not forcing her but expressing his reasons. However, the way he phrases his support (telling her to abort) and the emotional impact could be problematic. The girlfriend's autonomy in reproductive decisions is crucial, and while he can express his concerns, ultimately the decision is hers unless there's a legal or medical context where joint decision-making is required. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's actions (delaying the process, hiding her pregnancy history) might be seen as manipulative or dishonest, which could justify the author feeling wronged. But from a legal and ethical standpoint, the right to make reproductive choices is a fundamental right. The author's pressure might not be in the wrong if they had discussed this beforehand, but her actions complicating the situation could affect the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concerns are valid, the key issue is the girlfriend's autonomy. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing his stance and his reasons, especially since the decision to abort isn't solely his. The girlfriend's delays and hidden history are on her, so the author's decision to advise an abortion isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
