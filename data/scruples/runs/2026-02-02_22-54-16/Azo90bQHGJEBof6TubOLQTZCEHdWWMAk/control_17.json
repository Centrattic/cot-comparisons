Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who asked about telling their girlfriend to get an abortion is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is young\u201422 and 23. They've been dating since August. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. She repeatedly mentioned that if she ever got pregnant, she'd have an abortion. Now she is pregnant, and the author is pressuring her to abort, citing reasons like his busy work schedule, her lack of income, and stress. She delayed the process, leading to a surgical abortion now. The author is upset she hid a past pregnancy and mislead him about her fertility.\n\nThe key points here are consent, trust, and the pressure on the woman to terminate the pregnancy. The author is essentially making the decision for her, which is her body. Even if they discussed it, the final decision should be hers. The fact that she delayed the appointment for personal reasons might indicate her own ambivalence. The author's stance that he doesn't want kids yet and her financial situation being a factor could be valid, but the main issue is his insistence on her having the abortion without respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, a person's right to make decisions about their own body is paramount. The author is not in the wrong in wanting to avoid parenthood if they're not ready, but pressuring her to make a decision she's hesitant about could be problematic. However, the question is whether he's wrong for suggesting the abortion. Since the decision ultimately rests with the woman, and he's not the one carrying the child, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong, but there's nuance here. The key is that he's not the one who has to go through the procedure. His concerns about their readiness are valid, but the way he's handling it, maybe not. But according to the scenario, he's not forcing her, just expressing his stance. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get the abortion. If he's respecting her decision but still sharing his perspective, maybe not. But the way it's framed, he's pushing her towards it, which could be wrong. However, in this context, since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, considering the information given, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making his position clear and she's the one making the ultimate decision. But there's a risk in pressuring someone, even if it's consensual. The complexity here is that both parties have valid concerns, but the decision is hers. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's not forcing her, just expressing his reasons and not taking responsibility. However, the way he's handling the situation might be ethically questionable, but based on the question's structure, the answer might be B.\n"
