Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend found out she's pregnant, and the man is advising her to get an abortion. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the couple is in a new relationship, started in August. The girlfriend had PCOS and had told him she couldn't get pregnant. She also mentioned she would get an abortion if pregnant. Now that she is pregnant, she's been slow in the process\u2014delaying the test, not getting an immediate appointment, etc. The man is concerned about their future, stating his inability to support a child financially and her current welfare status. He feels she's being inconsistent because she claims she can't get pregnant but had a pregnancy before, and she's now hesitating to abort. He's upset she withheld previous pregnancy info and is delaying the abortion, leading to a more invasive procedure.\n\nThe man is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to abort. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about consent, honesty, and decision-making in a relationship. The woman had made her stance clear about abortion, but then changed her mind or is delaying. The man is upset about the delays and the lack of information. However, pregnancy decisions are complex and personal. The man's role here is to advise, but ultimately the decision is hers. The woman's delays might be due to her own fears or mental health issues. The man's frustration is understandable, but is he in the wrong for pushing her to abort? \n\nHe also mentions she uses vulgar language about the baby, which is concerning. However, the bigger issue is her honesty about her fertility and past pregnancy. The man is justified in feeling betrayed if she misrepresented her medical history. But in terms of advising her to abort, it's a sensitive area. The legal and ethical aspects vary, but in Denmark, abortion is legal. However, the woman has the right to make the decision, even if it's delayed. The man's insistence might be seen as pressure, especially if she's not ready. \n\nThe key is whether he's respecting her autonomy. If he's pressuring her, that's problematic. But given their circumstances, he's voicing his concerns. The woman's delays leading to a surgical abortion are her responsibility, not necessarily his. So, in terms of the question: is he in the wrong? Probably not, but he's in a complicated situation. The answer is B.\n"
