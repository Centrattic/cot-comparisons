Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation involves a pregnancy, the girlfriend's past, and some conflicting information.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But the author now found out she was pregnant and had been pregnant before, which contradicts her previous statements. The author is upset because she delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical one now, and there's a risk she might not be able to get pregnant again. The author also mentions concerns about their financial situations and readiness for parenthood.\n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend didn't disclose her past pregnancy, possibly misled about her infertility, delayed the abortion process, and the author feels their trust was broken. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for pushing for the abortion.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint in Denmark, the woman has the right to choose an abortion within the allowed timeframe. The author's decision to have the abortion is a common stance, but the situation is complicated by the girlfriend's actions. However, the author's main issue is with the girlfriend's dishonesty and delays. The girlfriend's behavior could be seen as manipulative or deceitful, which might justify the author's frustration. But pressuring someone into an abortion, especially if they're hesitant, can be a sensitive issue. However, given that the author made their stance clear and the girlfriend didn't act promptly, the author might feel justified in their position.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is advocating for their own decision and the girlfriend's actions (delays, dishonesty) contributed to the situation, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But it's a nuanced case. The author isn't forcing the abortion; they're making their position clear. However, the girlfriend's autonomy is a factor. But given the context of trust broken and the girlfriend's own delays, the author's stance might be understandable.\n"
