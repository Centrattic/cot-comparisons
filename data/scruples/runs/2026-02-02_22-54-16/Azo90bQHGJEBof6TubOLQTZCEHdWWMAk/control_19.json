Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who asked the question (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is 22, and his girlfriend, 23, in Europe. They started dating in August. The GF has PCOS and said she can't get pregnant, and if she did, she would get an abortion. They found out she's pregnant two weeks ago, and now she's 8 weeks along. The laws in Denmark allow abortion up to 12 weeks, but after 8 weeks it's surgical. \n\nThe GF was slow in getting a test and doctor's appointment, which delayed the process. The author is stressed about his job and their financial situations, and the GF is reluctant, using vulgar language about killing the baby. She also mentioned a past pregnancy she didn't tell him about, which he sees as a red flag. She didn't reschedule the abortion until the last minute, leading to a surgical procedure. The author feels she misused his trust by not disclosing her past and being dishonest about her fertility.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a relationship where both parties had discussed the possibility of pregnancy and abortion. The GF had repeatedly told him she couldn't get pregnant and would abort if she did. Now that she's pregnant, he's urging her to proceed with the abortion. She's hesitant, which he attributes to her delaying the process, leading to a more invasive procedure. \n\nThe GF's actions include not getting a test quickly, missing appointments, and being unclear about her intentions. She also withheld a significant detail about a prior pregnancy. The author is concerned about the future implications of a surgical abortion on her fertility and their ability to handle a child. \n\nLegally, in Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. The author's main point is that her delays caused the need for a surgical procedure. He feels she wasn't honest about her fertility and past, which is why he's pushing for the abortion. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's decision to ask for an abortion is based on their current inability to support a child and the risks involved. However, the GF's hesitation and delays might be due to personal or emotional reasons not mentioned here. \n\nBut the key issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about his responsibility in suggesting the abortion. Since they had discussed this scenario before, and she had agreed to abort if pregnant, the author is following through based on their prior understanding. However, her actions suggest she may not be fully committed to that decision, leading to the current conflict.\n\nThe author's concern about the surgical abortion's impact on her fertility is valid, but he also points out her delays as the reason for the procedure's invasiveness. He feels she misused his trust by not being truthful about her past and fertility status. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not wrong for suggesting the abortion, given their prior agreement and the circumstances. However, the situation is complex, and both parties have their own issues. The author's frustration is justified given the delays and lack of transparency. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's acting based on their prior discussions and the reality of their current situation, even though the GF's handling of the pregnancy complicates things.\n"
