Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend became pregnant, and the author is asking if he was right to tell her to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 22, his girlfriend is 23. They've been dating since August. She mentioned she has PCOS and can't get pregnant, but later it turns out she was pregnant before and PCOS developed after that. Now she's pregnant again. The author is against having the child because of their current situations\u2014his job is demanding, she's on welfare, mental health issues, etc. The girlfriend has been slow in getting the abortion process started, leading to a surgical one now. She also used harsh language, like \"kill the baby,\" and didn't mention her previous pregnancy until later.\n\nThe author feels she lied about not being able to get pregnant and withheld information. He's frustrated because she delayed the process, making it more complicated. He's not ready for a child and doesn't think she is either. The question is whether he's in the wrong for suggesting the abortion.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, this is complex. The author's reasons for wanting an abortion are based on their current life circumstances. However, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal one and typically the woman's choice. The key points here are the trust issues\u2014she didn't disclose her past pregnancy and delayed the process. The author might feel betrayed, but pushing for an abortion against her initial hesitation could be problematic. Also, the girlfriend's hesitation and eventual decision not to proceed with the abortion at the doctor's office might indicate her own internal conflict.\n\nThe author might be right to be upset about the lack of honesty, but pressuring her to have an abortion, especially when she's already hesitant, could be seen as overstepping. The fact that she changed her mind at the last minute and didn't reschedule complicates things. It's possible that both parties have valid frustrations, but the author's approach in telling her to abort might be wrong if it's not her decision to make. Ultimately, the decision should be mutual and respectful, considering both perspectives. However, the author's reasons are based on their inability to support a child, which is a common concern. But the way he's handling it, especially if she's not fully on board, might be where he's in the wrong.\n"
