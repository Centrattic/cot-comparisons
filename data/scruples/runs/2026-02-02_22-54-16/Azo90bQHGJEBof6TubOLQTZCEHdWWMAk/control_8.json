Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong (AITA) for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the couple is young, 22 and 23, in Europe. The girlfriend has PCOS and had previously said she couldn't get pregnant. She also mentioned she would get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. Now she's pregnant, and they\u2019re dealing with the decision.\n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend delayed the abortion process, leading to needing a surgical procedure. The author is upset because he thinks she misused his trust by not disclosing her past pregnancy and possibly lying about her fertility. He's also concerned about their financial and life situations, not being ready for a child. He's not in favor of having a kid now because of work and stress, and he's worried about her welfare dependency and mental health.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior includes using vulgar language about the abortion, hesitating during the process, and hiding her past pregnancy. She also didn't call for an immediate doctor's appointment when she should have, leading to delays.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in Denmark, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks. The girlfriend is at 8 weeks, so the timing is within the legal window. However, because of her delays, she's now facing a surgical rather than a chemical procedure, which might have more risks. The author is upset that she didn't act quicker, which he feels would have made the process easier.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for advising the abortion. The user is looking for an answer A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. The woman has the right to make decisions about her body, including abortion. However, the situation involves a relationship where both partners have different levels of readiness. The author is expressing his concerns about not being able to support a child, which is valid. However, pressuring her to have an abortion could be seen as controlling, especially if he's using her financial dependence on him as a factor.\n\nThe girlfriend's delays and her history of hiding past pregnancies might be red flags, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is right to push for an abortion. The decision should be hers, and while he can express his concerns, making her proceed with an abortion could be seen as overriding her autonomy, especially if she's hesitant.\n\nHowever, the author is sharing his perspective, stating that he's not in favor of having a child right now and that he's not ready. He's also concerned about future fertility risks from the surgical abortion. But the girlfriend's hesitation and delays might indicate that she's conflicted, and the author's insistence could be adding pressure on her during a difficult time.\n\nIn terms of trust, the girlfriend might have misled him about her fertility, which is a breach of trust. But the author's response\u2014telling her to get an abortion\u2014might be a way to handle the situation, though it could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and autonomy.\n\nSo, balancing the facts: the author isn't wrong for having concerns and wanting to avoid a child now, especially given their life circumstances. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014pressuring her for an abortion and pointing out her delays\u2014could be seen as not respecting her agency. On the other hand, the girlfriend's actions (delays, hiding past pregnancy) have contributed to the current situation.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person's actions crossed a line. Here, the author is advising the abortion, which is a personal choice, but in the context of their relationship, it's a complex decision. The girlfriend's autonomy is key here. If the author is pressuring her to make a decision against her will, that's a problem. However, he's not forcing her; he's expressing his stance. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend is the one who delayed the process and is now hesitant, the author might feel justified in his stance. However, the way he's presenting it\u2014feeling no empathy for her because of her delays\u2014might be the issue. The core question is whether he's in the wrong for advising the abortion. Since it's her decision, he might be overstepping by making it about his readiness rather than respecting her process. But he's also not wrong in expressing his inability to support a child at this time.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's stating his position and concerns, and it's within their relationship to discuss such matters. However, the way he's handling it could be seen as dismissive. But since the final decision rests with her, he's not forcing her. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
