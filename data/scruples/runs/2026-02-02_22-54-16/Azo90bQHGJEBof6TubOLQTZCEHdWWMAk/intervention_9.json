Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for my analysis based on the provided Reddit post.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old guy who's in a relationship with his 23-year-old girlfriend. They found out she's pregnant, and she had planned to get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. But now she's hesitating. The author supports the abortion, but she's delaying the process, leading to a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one. He's upset because she didn't act quickly enough and also mentioned she lied about her fertility history.\n\nSo, the main points are: she said she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS but had a past pregnancy. She's now hesitant to abort, causing delays. The author is frustrated because he doesn't want a child now, and her delays are leading to a riskier procedure. He also feels betrayed because she didn't get a doctor's confirmation about her infertility and hid her previous pregnancy.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for suggesting the abortion. From what I read, abortion is legal in Denmark, and the author isn't forcing her; he's expressing his stance based on their current situations. However, the key issue is whether he's in the wrong for advocating for the abortion when she's the one carrying the child. In many cases, the pregnant person has autonomy over their body, so the author's role in deciding the outcome might be questionable. But he's sharing his perspective and reasoning, which is common in relationships to discuss such major decisions. \n\nShe's the one delaying the procedure, which complicates things. His frustration seems valid because he's considering their financial and life circumstances. However, the main ethical point is whether he's correct in pushing for the abortion when she's the one making the medical decisions. Since he's not the one undergoing the procedure, he can't force her to do it, but he's sharing his position. \n\nThe author's actions here are more about expressing his stance and possibly feeling the need to have a say because they're in a relationship. But ultimately, the decision to proceed with an abortion lies with the pregnant person. So if he's pressuring her to make that decision, maybe he's overstepping. However, the context shows that she initially said she would get an abortion if pregnant, so he's supporting her stated choice. Now she's hesitating, which complicates things. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author is following her original plan and supporting the abortion, but she's now changing her mind, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to the initial agreement. However, the fact that she delayed could indicate her own uncertainty, and the author's insistence might not consider her changing feelings. But given the circumstances, he's not forcing her; he's just expressing his opinion. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. His actions are based on their previous agreement and his concerns about their current situations. While the final decision is hers, the author is voicing his support for the initial plan he agreed to with her. The issue is her changing her mind and the delays causing complications. The author's frustration is about the practical implications of the delay, not forcing her to have the abortion.\n"
