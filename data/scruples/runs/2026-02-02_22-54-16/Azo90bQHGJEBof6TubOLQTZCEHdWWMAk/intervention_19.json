Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who asked the question on Reddit (the author) is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me go through the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend started dating in August. She has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. She mentioned that if she did get pregnant, she'd get an abortion. Now, she's pregnant and he's asking if telling her to abort makes him the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend was initially clear about her stance on pregnancy and abortion. She delayed the process by not getting a test quickly, missing appointments, etc. The author is concerned about their financial situations and readiness for a child. She also used vulgar language about the abortion and mentioned a previous pregnancy she hadn't told him about, which he sees as a red flag.\n\nThe author feels she misused his trust by not disclosing her past pregnancy and possibly lying about her infertility. The girlfriend's hesitation and delays led to needing a surgical abortion, which he's not upset about her current situation but about her actions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In a relationship, both partners should have mutual respect for each other's decisions. The author is pressuring her to make a decision she hasn't been fully on board with. Even if she delayed the process, the decision to abort is hers, and pressuring her might be controlling. Also, he's using the financial and readiness arguments, which are valid, but the way he's handling it could be seen as dismissive of her autonomy. The fact that she changed her mind about the abortion after discussing with the doctor adds complexity. The author's knowledge of her past might make him feel betrayed, but that doesn't automatically make him right in pressuring her. Ultimately, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal one, and the author's insistence could be problematic.\n"
