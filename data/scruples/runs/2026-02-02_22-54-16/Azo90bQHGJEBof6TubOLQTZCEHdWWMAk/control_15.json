Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is young, 22 and 23, in Europe, specifically Denmark. They've been dating since mid-August. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But now she is pregnant. She initially said she would get an abortion if she got pregnant, but she delayed the process, leading to a surgical abortion instead of a medical one. The author is upset because she didn't act quickly enough, which now might affect her fertility. Also, she hid her past pregnancy and didn't confirm her infertility with doctors. The guy argues that they aren't ready for a kid, given their financial and life situations, and she's on welfare with mental health issues. He feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her fertility history.\n\nSo, the main points are: Did the guy do wrong by advising her to abort? Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. She was at 8 weeks, so she could have a chemical abortion if she acted quickly. But she delayed, leading to a surgical one. The guy's reasoning is about their readiness\u2014jobs, finances, stress. But does that make him in the wrong? The girlfriend's autonomy is a big factor here. The author is pressuring her to make a decision based on their circumstances, but ultimately, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is her choice. \n\nAlso, the guy mentions she used vulgar language about killing the baby. That's a red flag for him, but it's her right to express that. However, he's not the one carrying the pregnancy, so his input is part of their relationship dynamics. The question is whether pressuring her to abort is wrong. If they had discussed their future and agreed beforehand, but she got pregnant despite her claims of infertility, maybe. But in this case, she was in denial about her past pregnancy and didn't confirm infertility. \n\nHe's also concerned about the risk of future fertility from surgical abortion. But that's a medical risk she has to weigh. The guy's role is to support her decision, not dictate it. However, he's sharing his perspective on why they aren't ready. The key issue is whether his actions were wrong. If he's expressing his stance and encouraging her to abort, but she has the final say, maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, by not being honest about her fertility history, she might have misled him. \n\nBut the main question is if he's in the wrong. He's not the one carrying the pregnancy, so he's advocating for his position. The problem is that the decision is hers, and pressuring her could be seen as wrong. But given their circumstances, maybe it's a mutual decision. However, in many contexts, the woman has the autonomy. So, if he's pressuring her, he might be in the wrong. But the situation is complex. The answer could be that he's not in the wrong because they're a couple and discussing their future, but the final decision is hers. Alternatively, pressuring her could be wrong regardless. The answer might hinge on the specific actions and whether he overstepped. Given the information, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's sharing his perspective in a relationship context, but the actual decision is hers. However, there's a nuance here because he's pressuring her, but given their shared context, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The Reddit community might side with B because they're both considering their future together.\n"
