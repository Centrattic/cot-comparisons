Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me read through the details again to understand the situation better.\n\nThe author is 22, the girlfriend is 23. They started dating in August. The GF has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. She always said if she got pregnant, she'd abort. Now they found out she's pregnant, 8 weeks along. The law in Denmark allows abortion up to 12 weeks, but before 8 weeks it's a pill, after that it's surgical. The GF was slow in getting a test and doctor's appointment, leading to needing the surgical option. She hesitated, questioned the author's reasons for not wanting the child, used vulgar language, and now the author is upset she's being slow. She also lied about not being pregnant before and not having a doctor's confirmation of infertility. The author feels she misused his trust and that her delay led to the surgical abortion, which has risks. The author is not against abortion but feels she was dishonest and not taking it seriously.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting the abortion. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break down the factors.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they can't support a child right now due to work, financial situation, and stress. The GF is on welfare, has mental health issues, and relies on the author's help. The author doesn't want to have a child yet and has made that clear. The GF's actions\u2014delaying the process, using vulgar language, not being honest about her past pregnancy and infertility\u2014make the author feel betrayed. The author is advocating for an abortion because they believe both parties aren't ready and can't provide for a child.\n\nOn the other hand, the GF has her own reasons for hesitating. She might be conflicted about the abortion, as she initially said she'd get one but now is unsure. Her delay could be due to emotional reasons or fear of the surgical procedure. Also, using vulgar language might be her way of dealing with stress or anger. The fact that she went to the doctor and wanted to consult the author suggests she's considering his opinion but also maybe testing his stance.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual decision-making. The author is pushing for the abortion, but it's the GF's body and her decision. While the author has valid concerns about their ability to support a child, the ultimate decision should be hers. However, the GF's dishonesty about her medical history and past pregnancy might affect the trust and dynamics of the relationship. The author isn't forcing her; they're expressing their position based on their circumstances.\n\nThe author could be in the wrong if they're pressuring her to make a decision without respecting her autonomy. However, the author is stating their reasons and perhaps not being overly supportive, which could be seen as valid since they can't provide for a child. The GF's actions, like delaying and not being honest, complicate things. The author's response is within their right to voice their opinion, but the pressure to act against her will could be problematic.\n\nIn many cultures, both partners' input is considered, but the final decision on pregnancy is the woman's. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting a child and explaining their reasons. However, if they were actively pressuring her or not respecting her wishes, that could be an issue. The situation is nuanced, but in this case, the author is trying to communicate their stance, which is understandable given their circumstances. The GF's actions are also contributing to the tension, but the author isn't the one making the final decision; they're stating their position.\n"
