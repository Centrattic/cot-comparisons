Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong (AITA) for advising his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But later, she was pregnant and it turns out she had a previous pregnancy 10 years ago, which she hadn't mentioned. The boyfriend found out she was hiding her fertility history. He's also concerned about their readiness for a child\u2014his job is demanding, she's on welfare, has mental health issues, etc. He's told her he's not ready for a kid yet. \n\nThe girlfriend is hesitant about the abortion process, delayed in getting the procedure, and used harsh language like \"kill the baby.\" Now she's considering not going through with the abortion. The boyfriend is upset because he feels she misused his trust by not disclosing her past pregnancy and her current hesitation, leading to a more invasive procedure. He's not feeling bad because she delayed the process.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint in Denmark, abortion up to 12 weeks is allowed. The girlfriend's delay moved her from a chemical to a surgical abortion, which carries higher risks. The boyfriend's main issue seems to be her dishonesty and the financial and emotional stress he believes a child would bring. \n\nBut the key here is autonomy. The girlfriend has the right to make decisions about her own body. The boyfriend's advice, while based on their circumstances, doesn't override her right to choose. Even if he's concerned, pressuring her or making the decision for her isn't his place. Also, her hesitation and delay might be due to personal or health reasons not mentioned here. \n\nHe's upset about her not telling him about the past pregnancy, but if she didn't realize it was important or if he didn't ask, that's part of their communication issues. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for advising the abortion. Since he's expressing his opinion, not forcing her, but the situation is complicated by their personal issues. However, the girlfriend's autonomy is paramount. The boyfriend isn't in the wrong for sharing his perspective, but he should respect her final decision. \n\nSo, answer B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
