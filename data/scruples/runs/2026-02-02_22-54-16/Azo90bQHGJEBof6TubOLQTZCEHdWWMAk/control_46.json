Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is at fault for advising their girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation involves a pregnancy, the girlfriend's past statements about being unable to have children, her hesitation in proceeding with the abortion, and some hidden information she later revealed.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend found out his girlfriend was pregnant, and she had previously stated she couldn't get pregnant and would abort if she did. Now, she's hesitating, which led to needing a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one because of delays. He's upset about her delays, her using vulgar language about the abortion, her past pregnancy she didn't mention, and her current financial and mental health issues. He's questioning whether he's at fault for pushing her to abort.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend had previously stated her stance on abortion, but now she's hesitating. The boyfriend's decision to push for an abortion is based on their current life circumstances. However, the fact that she was pregnant before but never mentioned it and claimed she couldn't get pregnant complicates things. Also, the boyfriend's concern about her delays affecting the type of abortion available is valid from a medical standpoint.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the boyfriend isn't at fault for wanting to proceed with the abortion given their situation. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for making the decision for her. The girlfriend has the right to make her own reproductive choices. The boyfriend is expressing his concerns and preferences, which is valid, but he can't make the decision for her. The fact that she was hesitant and delayed the process might indicate her own internal conflict, which he's responding to. However, the core issue is that he's advocating for her to follow through with a decision she initially made, which he supported. The delays and her changed stance might be the bigger issues here.\n\nLegally and ethically, the woman has autonomy over her body, so pushing for an abortion isn't inherently wrong, but the boyfriend's role in pressuring her could be a point of contention. However, given the context of their previous conversations and the current circumstances, his stance might be seen as reasonable. The girlfriend's actions (delaying, not mentioning past pregnancy) could be seen as contributing factors. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's acting based on their prior agreement and current realities, even if his approach is firm.\n"
