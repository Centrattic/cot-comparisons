Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old guy in Europe, probably Denmark. His girlfriend, who is 23, has PCOS and has been saying she can't get pregnant. They've been dating since August. She told him she couldn't get pregnant and that if she did, she'd have an abortion. Now she's pregnant, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions seem a bit conflicting. She claimed she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS, but she actually got pregnant. She also has a history of being pregnant before, which she didn't disclose. She delayed the abortion process, leading to needing a surgical one instead of a chemical one. She used harsh language like \"kill the baby\" and questioned his reasons for not wanting the child. The author feels she lied about her fertility and hid past pregnancies, leading to his frustration.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Was the author wrong to ask for an abortion? In many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. The author supported her decision to abort initially, but now he's pressuring her again. However, the girlfriend's behavior complicates things. She seems to have misled him about her ability to conceive and her past, which could be a breach of trust.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting the abortion. Since both had agreed that if she got pregnant, she would abort, and he's now reinforcing that decision, it's within their prior agreement. However, the way he's handling it\u2014maybe pressuring her or not considering her feelings\u2014could be problematic. The girlfriend's hesitation and delays might indicate she's conflicted, which the author might be exploiting or not adequately addressing.\n\nAlso, the author mentions she used vulgar language and questioned his motives, which might show she's under stress or conflicted. The author's responsibility is to support her through this decision, not to force it. Even if she delayed the process, once she's decided to proceed, he should respect that. However, if she's not committed, his frustration is understandable, but pressuring her could be wrong.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, the woman's autonomy is key. The author's role should be to support her decision, not dictate it. If he's pressuring her, that's a problem. However, if they had mutual understanding beforehand and he's now just upholding that agreement, it's less clear. But her delayed actions and hidden past might have contributed to the situation, which could affect how the author is perceived.\n\nOverall, while the author's frustration might be justified given her actions, pressuring her for an abortion when she's hesitant could be seen as wrong. The right to make the decision lies with the woman, and he shouldn't push her if she's conflicted. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if he's insisting on the abortion against her current hesitations, even if they discussed it before.\n"
