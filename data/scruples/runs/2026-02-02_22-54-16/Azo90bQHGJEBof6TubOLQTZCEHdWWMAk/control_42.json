Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting that his girlfriend get an abortion. The situation involves a couple in their early 20s in Europe, specifically Denmark. The girlfriend has PCOS, mentioned she can't get pregnant, and previously said she would get an abortion if she ever became pregnant. Now she's 8 weeks pregnant, and the author is pressuring her to abort because he's not ready for a child, citing work and financial reasons. The girlfriend is hesitant, slow in the process, and there's some hidden history she revealed, like a past pregnancy and not having a doctor confirm her infertility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, which is what's happening here. The author's main argument is that he's not ready for a child and that the girlfriend's financial situation (on welfare) and his own work commitments make parenthood unfeasible. However, the girlfriend is the one who is pregnant, so the decision to have an abortion ultimately affects her body and her health. The author is pressuring her to make a decision that's irreversible and carries medical risks, like potential infertility.\n\nThe girlfriend's hesitation could stem from various factors, including emotional attachment, fear of the procedure, or uncertainty. The author criticizes her for being slow, but his own pressure might contribute to her anxiety. Also, the girlfriend's use of vulgar language about the abortion and her past pregnancy are red flags the author points out, but it's important to consider her perspective as well. The author might be dismissing her feelings or not engaging in a supportive manner.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the right to bodily autonomy is a significant factor. The girlfriend has the right to make decisions about her own body, even if her partner disagrees. The author's insistence on abortion could be seen as controlling, especially if it's based on his own unpreparedness rather than her well-being. The fact that she initially presented herself as infertile and later revealed a past pregnancy might indicate dishonesty, but the author's role in this is to question her trustworthiness rather than his own responsibility in the relationship.\n\nThe author's argument about financial and emotional readiness is valid for many people, but it's important to recognize that the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is deeply personal and should be made without external pressure, especially from a partner. The author's frustration with the girlfriend's process speed and her past actions could cloud his judgment, leading him to act in a way that's not supportive.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns about being unprepared for parenthood are understandable, his insistence on an abortion without fully considering his girlfriend's autonomy and emotional state places him in the wrong. The decision should be hers to make, and his pressure undermines her agency in the situation.\n"
