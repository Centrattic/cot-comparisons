Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who asked the question (the author) is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a couple in Europe, specifically Denmark, where abortion laws are in place. The girl has PCOS and told the author she couldn't get pregnant. They ended up getting pregnant, and the author is pressuring her to have an abortion. Now, the author is asking if they're at fault for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In Denmark, abortion up to 12 weeks is legal. The author mentions the timeline\u2014she found out she was pregnant two weeks ago, and now she's 8 weeks along. So they're still within the legal window. The author is upset because she delayed getting an appointment, leading to a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. That might be a point of contention here. The author feels she's being irresponsible by not acting quickly enough.\n\nNext, the emotional and ethical part. The author is concerned about their future and their ability to support a child. They mention working 24/7, not having the financial stability, and the girlfriend being on welfare with mental health issues. The author's main argument is that they can't provide for a child right now, so an abortion is necessary. But the girlfriend is hesitating, and the author is frustrated. The girlfriend also used vulgar language when talking about abortion, which the author finds disrespectful. Additionally, the girlfriend hid her previous pregnancy and PCOS history, which the author sees as a breach of trust.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many places, both partners can have their say regarding reproductive decisions, but it's typically the woman's choice. The author is pressuring the girlfriend to have an abortion, which could be seen as controlling. Even if the author has valid concerns about being able to support a child, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is usually up to the woman. The author might be overstepping by pressuring her, especially if the girlfriend is hesitant. However, the author is also sharing their reasons for not wanting a child, which is understandable.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the girlfriend's actions. She delayed the process, and the author feels she misused their trust by not being honest about her medical history. She also questioned the author's reasons and was hesitant, which the author finds concerning. However, the woman's right to make decisions about her own body is a key factor here. Even if the author feels betrayed or frustrated, pressuring her to have an abortion against her will (or if she's hesitant) could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the communication between the couple. The author says they've discussed not wanting a child yet, and the girlfriend was aware of that. But the girlfriend's actions (delaying the process, hiding her past pregnancy) might have contributed to the situation. However, the author's main action here is advising the girlfriend to get an abortion, which could be seen as valid if they're in agreement, but if the girlfriend is against it, the author might be overstepping.\n\nIn some contexts, if both partners are in agreement, making the decision together is fine. But if one partner is pressuring the other, it's a different story. The author is the one who's explicitly told her \"no\" regarding wanting a child, so they might feel justified in wanting her to get the abortion. However, the girlfriend's autonomy is important. Even if the author's reasons are valid, the decision ultimately lies with the woman.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong for expressing their concerns and wanting the abortion, but pressuring the girlfriend to go through with it, especially if she's hesitant, could be an issue. However, given the context of their prior discussions where the author made it clear they don't want a child yet, and the girlfriend's own uncertainties and delays, the author's stance might be seen as reasonable. But ethically, the decision should be the woman's, so if the author is forcing or pressuring her, that could be problematic. However, in the scenario, the author is not forcing her but rather voicing their opinion, which might be acceptable.\n\nThe key here is that the author is advising based on their circumstances and prior agreements. If the girlfriend is making the decision, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for sharing their perspective. But if the author is trying to control the decision-making process, that's where it could go wrong. The answer depends on the cultural and legal context, but generally, the woman's autonomy is paramount. However, given that the author is advocating for the abortion based on their shared prior discussions and the girlfriend's own hesitations, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But if the author is pressuring her beyond their own rights, that's another matter. Given the information, the author is expressing their stance based on their circumstances, which is their right, so the answer could be B (not in the wrong). However, others might argue that the author is overstepping, so it's a nuanced situation. But according to the user's request for a binary answer, it's between A and B.\n"
