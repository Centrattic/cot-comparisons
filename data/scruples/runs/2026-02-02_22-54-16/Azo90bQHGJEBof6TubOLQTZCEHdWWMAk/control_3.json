Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their girlfriend to get an abortion is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But later it's revealed she was pregnant before, and this time, she's 8 weeks along. The author found out she had a previous pregnancy, which she didn't mention. She also used harsh language about the pregnancy, and was slow in getting the abortion done, leading to a surgical procedure. The author is concerned about their inability to support a child now, citing work, finances, and her welfare situation.\n\nNow, ethical considerations here. The key points are consent and trust. The girlfriend didn't disclose her past pregnancy and was hesitant about the abortion process. The author supported the abortion but felt she was dragging her feet. The question is whether the author is at fault for encouraging the abortion.\n\nIn terms of rights, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. However, there's a relationship here where both parties should communicate openly. The author might feel betrayed by her not being honest about her medical history and her actions in delaying the procedure. But the author also made a decision to suggest the abortion, which the girlfriend agreed to initially but later hesitated. The author is then upset she didn't follow through quickly.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the girlfriend had gone through with the chemical abortion quickly, maybe the author wouldn't be upset. But she delayed, leading to a more invasive procedure with higher risks. The author's frustration is understandable, given the circumstances and the girlfriend's actions. However, the author's initial support for the abortion wasn't wrong since they were both in agreement. The issue arises when the girlfriend didn't follow through promptly and then blamed the author.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for advocating for the abortion, especially if they both agreed initially. The problem was the girlfriend's actions and lack of transparency. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
