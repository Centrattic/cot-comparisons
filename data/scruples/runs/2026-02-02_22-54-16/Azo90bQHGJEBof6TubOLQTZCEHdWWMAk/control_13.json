Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is young\u201422 and 23. They've been dating since August. The girlfriend has PCOS and told him she couldn't get pregnant. But then she did. The author is upset because she didn't take the abortion process quickly and now needs a surgical one due to being 8 weeks in. He lists reasons why they aren't ready for a kid: his job is stressful, she's on welfare, has mental health issues, and uses vulgar language about the abortion. Also, he finds out she was pregnant before and lied about not being able to conceive. He's telling her to abort, but she's hesitating, and he's not feeling bad about her needing the surgical option because she delayed.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent, trust, and mutual decision-making. The girlfriend told him she couldn't get pregnant, which turned out to be a lie. She also delayed the process, which led to a more invasive procedure. The author is pressuring her to abort, but she's not on board. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn a relationship, decisions about pregnancy are typically mutual. If he's pressuring her to have an abortion when she's not sure, that's a problem. Even if he has valid concerns (like financial stability), the way he's handling it matters. Using the term \"kill the baby\" is harsh and might indicate a lack of empathy. Also, the fact that she delayed the process could be due to her own anxiety or confusion, which he's not addressing with support. The author's frustration about her not acting faster might be because he wants the abortion done, but that's not the girlfriend's responsibility to speed things up. The trust issue is real because she lied about her fertility history. However, the author's main action here is advising her to abort, which could be seen as controlling if she's not making the decision freely. It's also possible that the author's stress about not being ready for a child is valid, but how he's handling it could be considered wrong if he's not respecting her autonomy in the decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's pressuring her to make a decision, using derogatory language about abortion, and not fully respecting her autonomy and the shared nature of the decision. Even if he has reasons, the way he's approaching the situation isn't supportive or respectful.\n"
