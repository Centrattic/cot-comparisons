Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author advising his girlfriend to get an abortion, and she ended up deciding against it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 22, the girlfriend 23. They've been dating since August. She mentioned she can't get pregnant due to PCOS and would abort if she ever did. They found out she's pregnant, and she's 8 weeks along. In Denmark, the abortion process changes at 8 weeks from chemical to surgical. The author is concerned about their inability to support a child, her welfare status, mental health, and his own work stress. She delayed the process, which made it surgical, and then revealed she was pregnant before, which he saw as a red flag. She used vulgar language about killing the baby and now refuses to abort after being asked.\n\nThe author is questioning if he's in the wrong for not supporting her to abort and for feeling she misused his trust. \n\nNow, considering the moral and ethical aspects. In relationships, both partners should communicate openly about their intentions, especially regarding major life decisions like having a child. The girlfriend did inform him about her inability to get pregnant (though it's unclear if a doctor confirmed it) and her stance on abortion. However, she later hid her past pregnancy, which might have affected his decision-making. \n\nThe author's reasons for not wanting a child are valid\u2014financial stability, career, and readiness. It's common for people to feel unprepared. However, pressuring someone into an abortion against their will is ethically problematic. The girlfriend decided not to abort after all, so the author's insistence might have contributed to her change of heart, which complicates things. \n\nLegally, in Denmark, both partners can have a say, but the ultimate decision lies with the woman. The author's role is more advisory. By not supporting her through the process and expressing his stance, he might have overstepped, especially if her decision to continue the pregnancy is her own. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's delays might have made the process more complicated for her, and the author's frustration is understandable. However, the way he frames it\u2014feeling no sympathy because she was slow\u2014could be seen as insensitive. \n\nIn terms of trust, if she misrepresented her medical condition (PCOS vs. actual infertility) and hid her past pregnancy, that's on her. But the author's response in suggesting abortion might have been valid under the circumstances, given their discussions. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author has valid concerns about readiness, but his approach in advising an abortion and feeling she misused trust might be where he's in the wrong. Pressuring a partner to terminate a pregnancy can be seen as controlling. However, the girlfriend's actions also contributed. The question is whether the author's actions cross into being the asshole. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because pressuring someone into an abortion, even for good reasons, can be ethically wrong if it's not their decision to make. The girlfriend made her choice, and the author's insistence might have been overstepping, especially if she decided against it in the end. However, there's nuance here. But based on the AITA framework, often the person who applies pressure or makes decisions for their partner is seen as the asshole.\n"
