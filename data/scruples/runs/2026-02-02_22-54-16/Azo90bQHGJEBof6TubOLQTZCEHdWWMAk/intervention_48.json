Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who told their girlfriend to get an abortion is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the man and his girlfriend are in a relationship that started in August. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. She also mentioned that if she ever got pregnant, she'd just get an abortion. Now they found out she's pregnant, and she's been slow in the process of getting the abortion. The man wants her to abort because of various reasons: his work schedule, her welfare status, mental health issues, and the stress of raising a child. He's also concerned about future fertility since a surgical abortion might affect her ability to get pregnant again. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is hesitant and even went to the gynecologist but didn't proceed with the abortion. She also revealed a past pregnancy, which he sees as a red flag. He feels she lied about her infertility and isn't acting responsibly. The key points here are the abortion decision, the girlfriend's actions, and the man's reasoning.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main question is whether advising an abortion in this context is acceptable or not. In many places, including Denmark, abortion is legal, so advising it isn't illegal. However, ethical considerations come into play. The man's reasons are based on their current life situations: financial instability, stress, and future plans. The girlfriend, however, is not on board with the abortion and even delayed the process. There's a conflict in their priorities and communication. The man felt the need to express his stance, especially since they were not in agreement. \n\nBut is it the man's place to push for an abortion? In a relationship, both partners have their own responsibilities and autonomy. The girlfriend has the right to make her own medical decisions, including whether to continue the pregnancy. However, the man is concerned about the implications for both of them. The girlfriend's actions, like delaying the abortion and not rescheduling, might indicate she's not ready to terminate the pregnancy, which complicates things. The man's frustration arises from feeling that she's not taking the situation seriously and is putting both of them at risk. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. The man feels she lied about her fertility and hid her past pregnancy. That could affect their relationship dynamics and his trust in her. However, the man's decision to tell her to get an abortion might come across as dismissive of her autonomy and emotions. Even if he's considering future planning, the final decision on the pregnancy lies with the woman, as per legal and ethical standards. \n\nSo, is the man in the wrong? He's expressing his position based on their circumstances, but in doing so, he might be imposing his will on her decision. The girlfriend's hesitation and delays could lead to more complex medical procedures, which he's now holding against her. There's a lack of communication and mutual understanding here. The man might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's a gray area. He's responsible for his own stance but should respect her autonomy. However, given the context of their relationship and the girlfriend's actions, the man's frustration is understandable. \n\nIn conclusion, while the man has valid concerns, advising an abortion without mutual agreement could be seen as overstepping, especially if the girlfriend is not on board. However, given the circumstances and her actions, he might feel justified. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on their shared future, but there's a need for more nuanced consideration of her autonomy.\n"
