Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the A**) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the writer, who is 22, and his girlfriend, who is 23. They started dating in August, and she told him she has PCOS and couldn't get pregnant. She also mentioned that if she did get pregnant, she would just have an abortion. Now they found out she's pregnant, but she's been slow in the process, and he's upset because she might have to have a surgical abortion, which could affect her fertility. The writer is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend had a history of PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant. She also said she would get an abortion if she did. The writer argues against having a child due to his work schedule, her financial situation, and their current inability to support a child. The girlfriend, however, is taking longer than necessary, leading to the need for a surgical abortion. The writer is upset because she might not be able to get pregnant again after it, and he feels she's been dishonest about her past pregnancy and PCOS status.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the writer is in the wrong for encouraging the abortion. In a relationship, both partners should have mutual consent and agreement, especially on major life decisions like parenthood. The girlfriend's hesitation and delay might indicate that she isn't fully on board with the decision, which could imply a lack of communication or understanding between them. The writer's reasons for not wanting a child seem practical\u2014his job is demanding, she's on welfare, and he's concerned about stress and financial stability. However, it's important to note that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is ultimately the woman's, as it's her body. The legal and medical aspects in Denmark might also play a role here, but the question is about moral wrongdoing.\n\nThe girlfriend's use of vulgar language when discussing the abortion and her past pregnancy might be a factor, but that's more about communication style than the ethical issue. The writer is not in the wrong for expressing his stance, but he might have overstepped by not allowing her to make her own choice. Also, the fact that she didn't call for an immediate appointment despite the option in Denmark could mean she was considering her options, which the writer might not have respected. If the writer had a prior stance against her getting an abortion and she didn't act quickly, there might be a breakdown in communication.\n\nBut the core of the AITA is whether he's wrong for telling her to get an abortion. Since he's been clear from the start about not wanting children yet and she had previously stated she would get an abortion if she got pregnant, it's possible he's not in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's hesitation and delay might have made the situation more complex. The writer might be taking advantage of her PCOS claim to avoid responsibility, especially if she can still get pregnant. There's also the aspect of trust\u2014she told him she couldn't get pregnant but had a past pregnancy. This could be a point of contention, but was he justified in feeling that trust was broken?\n\nIn terms of ethics, the writer's decision to not support a child is personal, but the way he approached it might be another issue. If he pressured her into an abortion, that's a problem, but the post says he told her he didn't want a child. The girlfriend's delays might be due to her own uncertainty or fear, which the writer didn't consider. However, the fact that she went to the gynecologist and then wanted to consult him again might show she was seeking his input, which he provided.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the writer is not in the wrong) because the decision to terminate was part of their prior agreement. Her delays and hidden history are her responsibility, and he's acting based on the information he had. However, some might argue that he should have been more understanding of her hesitation. The main point is that the writer isn't wrong for sticking to his decision when the girlfriend's actions (delays) led to a situation he wasn't comfortable with.\n"
