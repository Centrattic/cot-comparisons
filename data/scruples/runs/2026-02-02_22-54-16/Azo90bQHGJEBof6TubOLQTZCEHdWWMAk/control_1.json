Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The user is 22, his girlfriend is 23, and they're in Europe, Denmark specifically. They've been dating since August, and the girl mentioned she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. She also said she'd get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. Now they found out she's pregnant, and there's some back and forth about the abortion process.\n\nFirst, the author is asking if he's at fault for telling her to get an abortion. Let's look at the key points. The girl had PCOS, thought she couldn't get pregnant, and had stated her intention to abort. But she ended up pregnant. She delayed the process by not getting a test, missing appointments, and taking longer than necessary. Because of this delay, she now has to have a surgical abortion, which has a higher risk of infertility. The author is upset because she lied about not being able to get pregnant in the past (she was pregnant 10 years ago) and is now hesitating when she said she wouldn't. He also mentions her current situation with welfare, mental health, and financial dependence on him. He doesn't want a kid yet and feels she's not ready.\n\nNow, the author is telling her to get the abortion, but she's been hesitant. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider consent and autonomy. In many places, the decision to have an abortion is primarily the woman's. Even if the partner is involved, it's her body. The author might feel his concerns are valid (career, stress, financial readiness), but he's pushing for an abortion. However, the woman delayed the process, possibly because she was conflicted. The author might be pressuring her, but she also made choices that led to the current situation. \n\nThere's also the issue of trust. She told him she couldn't get pregnant, but that's not confirmed by a doctor, and she had been pregnant before. That could be a breach of trust from her side. The author's frustration is understandable, but is he in the wrong for wanting an abortion? He's making a choice based on his life circumstances. However, the fact that he's pressuring her could be problematic if she's not in favor. But she initially agreed to abort if she got pregnant, so maybe she's the one changing her mind. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for expressing his stance, especially since he's made it clear he doesn't want a child yet. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get the abortion. In many ethical frameworks, the decision must be mutual, and the woman's autonomy is key. If he's using pressure or manipulation, that's a problem. However, given the context where she delayed the process and now faces surgical risks, the author's lack of empathy might be an issue. Still, he's not forcing her; he's making his position clear. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions are within his rights to express his preference, but the situation is more complicated due to her delays and the resulting complications. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's stating his position based on their initial agreement and his life circumstances, even if there's room for criticism in how he handles it.\n"
