Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. They found out she's pregnant, and she's been slow in the process, leading to needing a surgical abortion. She also mentioned she had a past pregnancy she didn't tell him about. The author is upset because she lied about not being able to get pregnant and is now hesitant to abort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has PCOS but no official diagnosis preventing pregnancy. She had a previous pregnancy, which she didn't disclose. The author didn't want kids yet, and she knew that. She delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical one. The author feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her fertility and past. \n\nNow, the key points: The author is 22, the girlfriend 23. In a European context, abortion laws vary, but in Denmark, it's legal up to 12 weeks. The author's main argument is about trust and her actions leading to a more invasive procedure. The girlfriend's hesitation and delays caused the need for surgery, which has risks of infertility. The author is concerned about future plans and their ability to support a child.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he made a decision to have an abortion, and she didn't follow through quickly. But in many places, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is up to the woman. Even if they're in a relationship, the final choice is hers. The author's pressure might be seen as respecting her autonomy versus his own views. However, she did seek his opinion before the appointment, which complicates things. Also, her delays led to a more complex procedure, which he didn't support. \n\nBut legally and ethically, the woman has the right to make that decision. The author's frustration is understandable, but pushing for an abortion might infringe on her autonomy. However, she agreed to abort initially but delayed. Now, she's changing her mind? Wait, no, the author says she didn't reschedule and spoke to him the night before. She might be reconsidering. \n\nHe's also upset about her past pregnancy and not disclosing it. That's a breach of trust. But does that mean he's in the wrong? He's reacting to her dishonesty. However, the core issue is the abortion decision. Even if she was dishonest, pushing for her to abort could still be seen as respecting her right to choose. The author might be in a difficult spot, but the decision ultimately rests with her. \n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether the author overstepped by pressuring her, especially if she's hesitant. But since she initially agreed but delayed, and now the situation is more complicated, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, he might be wrong for not respecting her autonomy. Hmm. It's a tough call, but given that the decision is hers, he might be in the wrong for pressuring. But in the scenario, she was the one who asked his opinion. So maybe he's not entirely at fault. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. If the girlfriend is hesitant and the author is pressuring her, that could be seen as wrong. But if she agreed to abort initially but delayed, then the author's frustration is understandable. However, once she's hesitant, he shouldn't force her decision. The key is her autonomy. Even if she delayed, the decision isn't his to make. So the author is in the wrong for pressuring her into a decision that she's now hesitant about. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
