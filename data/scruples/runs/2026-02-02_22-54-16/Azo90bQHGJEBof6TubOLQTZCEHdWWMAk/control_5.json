Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his girlfriend to get an abortion after she became pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple is young, both 22 and 23, in Europe. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But she ended up pregnant anyway. She had initially said she would get an abortion if pregnant. However, when she found out, she was slow in taking action, delayed medical appointments, and now she's at the surgical abortion window. The author argues she could have acted faster to avoid the surgery, which carries a risk of infertility.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is questionable. She claimed she couldn't get pregnant but later admitted to being pregnant before. The author feels she lied about her fertility. Also, she's using vulgar language about the abortion and is hesitant, which the author sees as her being dishonest. The author is concerned about their financial and life situations, not being ready for a child.\n\nLegally in Denmark, abortion is available up to 12 weeks. The girlfriend delayed seeking care, leading to a surgical procedure. The author believes she's responsible for her delays. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for pushing for an abortion.\n\nNow, considering ethics. The right to make reproductive decisions is a significant factor. Even if the author has valid concerns, the decision about pregnancy is typically up to the person carrying the pregnancy. Pressuring someone to terminate a pregnancy, even if there are valid reasons, can be seen as respecting their autonomy. However, the girlfriend's actions (delays, past pregnancy) might affect the situation. But the author is still making a decision that affects her body. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's mental health and financial instability are mentioned. The author is providing support, but the key issue is the pressure to abort. Even if he's concerned about future plans, he's not the one carrying the pregnancy. The question is whether he's overstepping. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, reproductive autonomy is a person's right. So, even if the author feels she's being irresponsible, he's not the one who must make the choice. Therefore, pressuring her to abort could be seen as wrong because it's her body and her decision. However, there are nuances, like her past deception and delays, but in terms of moral accountability, the pressure to abort might still fall on him. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend is acting irresponsibly, maybe the author's actions are justified. However, the core issue is whether pressuring for an abortion is wrong. The answer depends on cultural and ethical perspectives. In many contexts, the person carrying the pregnancy has the right to decide, so the author's insistence might be considered wrong. However, given the girlfriend's delays and the author's own reasons, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. \n\nBut I need to consider that in AITA contexts, the focus is on the action itself. The author is pressuring the girlfriend to abort despite her hesitations. Even if he has valid concerns, it's her decision. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's actions (lying, delays) complicate it. The author might feel justified, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his own life circumstances and the girlfriend's delays led to the situation, but ethically, he's pressuring her to make a decision that's hers. However, given the context, maybe the answer is B. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again. \n\nIn many societies, the right to terminate a pregnancy is tied to the woman's decision. So, even if the partner has concerns, pushing for an abortion against her will is problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But given the girlfriend's deception and delays, maybe the author isn't. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, the author is in the right because he's not ready for a child and the girlfriend's actions led to the complications. But the act of pressuring for an abortion is still ethically questionable. \n\nThis is tricky. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on their current circumstances, but I'm not entirely sure. However, in AITA, the focus is on the action. If he's pressuring her to abort, even if she's being irresponsible, the act of pressuring her could be wrong. But given the girlfriend's behavior, maybe he's justified. \n\nGiven all that, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's considering the practical aspects and the girlfriend's delays led to the surgical option. However, ethically, the decision should be hers. But in the context of the AITA subreddit, the community might side with the author due to the girlfriend's actions.\n"
