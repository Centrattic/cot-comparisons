Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The man is 22, his girlfriend is 23, they're in Europe. They've been dating since August. The girlfriend has PCOS and said she can't get pregnant. She also said if she got pregnant, she'd get an abortion. But when she actually got pregnant, she was slow in taking action\u2014forgot to buy a test, missed appointments. Now they found out she's 8 weeks pregnant, which in Denmark means a surgical abortion. The girlfriend is hesitant, using vulgar language like \"kill the baby,\" and the man is stressed about their financial situations and future. She also revealed she was pregnant 10 years ago, which the man sees as a red flag. He's upset she lied about not being able to get pregnant and hiding her past pregnancy. He's advising her to have the abortion, and she ended up not doing it yet. He feels she misused his trust and that she's responsible for the delay leading to a surgical procedure.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about the key points. The man's reasons for suggesting the abortion are based on their current life circumstances: he works a lot, can't take on more stress, financial issues (she's on welfare, he's supporting her). He's concerned about the future and their ability to care for a child. On the other hand, the woman is being slow in the process, perhaps because she's conflicted. She initially said she'd get an abortion if pregnant, but now seems to be wavering. The man is frustrated with her delay leading to a more invasive procedure. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, abortion is legal in Denmark up to 12 weeks. She's at 8 weeks, so she can still get it. The man is not the one who can make the decision; it's up to the woman. However, he's supporting her decision. But he's also upset about her not being honest about her fertility history and being slow in the process. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is he wrong to pressure her? Well, the decision to have an abortion is ultimately the woman's. If he's trying to influence her decision based on their life circumstances, some might say it's valid to consider practical aspects. However, if he's pressuring her to terminate because he doesn't want to take responsibility, that could be problematic. \n\nThe woman's behavior is also questionable. She was slow in seeking medical attention, used vulgar language about the fetus, and lied about her fertility. But the man is reacting to her actions. He's not forcing her to have the abortion; he's expressing his stance based on their situation. \n\nIn terms of trust issues, she withheld information about her past pregnancy and the PCOS diagnosis. That's her fault. The man is upset about that. But is he in the wrong for suggesting the abortion? It's a bit of a gray area. He's not forcing her, just advising her based on their circumstances. However, the way he's talking about the abortion as a \"no biggie\" might be dismissive of her feelings. \n\nThe key here is whether the man is in the wrong for advising the abortion. Since it's her decision, he can't make it for her. But he can express his concerns. If he's not pressuring her but just sharing his perspective, he's not in the wrong. However, the way he's framing it (AITA for telling her to abort) suggests he's taking a firm stance, which might be seen as not respecting her autonomy. But considering she's the one who sought his input, maybe it's appropriate. \n\nAlso, the woman's actions (delaying, not being honest) contribute to the problem. The man's frustration is understandable. But the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the decision is hers, and he's not forcing her, but is expressing his reasons based on their circumstances, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that he's being too controlling. But given the context, the woman's actions are also at fault. The man is reacting to her behavior, not being the sole cause. So, B is the answer.\n"
