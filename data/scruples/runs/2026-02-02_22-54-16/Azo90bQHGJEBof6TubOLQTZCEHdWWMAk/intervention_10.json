Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong after telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context they provided. The girlfriend had PCOS and had previously said she couldn't get pregnant, but it turns out she was pregnant. She delayed getting a test and medical appointments, leading to needing a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. She also lied about her ability to conceive and hid a past pregnancy. The guy is concerned about their financial and emotional readiness for a child. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend misrepresented her fertility history and didn't take the necessary steps promptly, which the guy found concerning. He's not forcing her to have the abortion but is making his stance clear about not being ready for parenthood. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's his right to express his feelings about not wanting a child, especially since they've discussed the future. However, the way he's handling it might affect their relationship. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like lying and delaying\u2014complicate things. \n\nLegally, in Denmark, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks, so the surgical procedure is an option. The guy isn't pressuring her beyond his own stance; he's stating his position. The moral responsibility here is tricky. While he's not wrong for expressing his wishes, the situation highlights communication issues. \n\nThe girlfriend's use of vulgar language and her hesitation might indicate her own internal conflict, but that doesn't absolve her of her role in the situation. The man's frustration is understandable given her actions. \n\nOverall, the man isn't in the wrong for advocating for his own desires, especially since they had discussed their future. The core issue is mutual trust and honesty, which both parties might have failed in. But since the question is about him being in the wrong, the answer leans towards B (No).\n"
