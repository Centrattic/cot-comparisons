Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend became pregnant, and the man is asking if he's at fault for telling her to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The couple started dating in August, and the woman had PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant. She also said she would get an abortion if she ever did. Now she's pregnant at 8 weeks and the law in Denmark allows for surgical abortion between 8-12 weeks. \n\nThe woman was slow in the process: forgot to buy a test, missed a doctor's appointment, and delayed scheduling. The man lists reasons why they can't have a child now, like financial issues and stress. She seems to be using vulgar terms about the abortion, and there's a history of her being pregnant before which she didn't mention. She also changed her mind at the gynecologist and wanted to consult him again.\n\nThe man feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her fertility and past pregnancy. He's upset she didn't speed up the process to avoid a surgical abortion. The user thinks the man isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if the man is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no).\n\nNow, considering the situation. The man is supporting her financially and she's on welfare with mental health issues. He's not pressuring her to have the child but is concerned about the feasibility. He's advising her to get an abortion, which is a personal medical decision. In many places, both partners have a right to express their views, but the decision is typically the woman's. However, the woman's behavior (delaying, changing her mind, not being honest) complicates things.\n\nThe key here is whether the man is at fault for expressing his opinion. Legally and ethically, he's not forcing her; he's sharing his reasons. The woman's actions (delays, dishonesty) seem to be the main issues. So the man's stance is based on their circumstances and her actions. It's a difficult situation, but he's not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to consider the practical aspects and advising her to proceed with the abortion. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
