Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple in Europe, specifically Denmark, where the woman becomes pregnant despite claiming she couldn't due to PCOS. The man is against the pregnancy and wants an abortion, but the woman is hesitant and delayed in the process. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and cultural context of Denmark. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, which is mentioned. The woman was 8 weeks pregnant, so she had options. The man's main argument is that she misled him by saying she couldn't get pregnant and that she was delaying the abortion process, leading to a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one. \n\nHe also mentions she had a past pregnancy, which she didn't disclose, which he sees as a red flag. He's upset about her using vulgar language regarding the abortion and her hesitation to proceed. The key points here are trust issues, the woman's decision-making regarding the pregnancy, and the man's pressure for an abortion.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy. Even if the man disagrees, the final decision rests with her. The man's insistence on the abortion could be seen as pressuring her, which is not his right. Additionally, the woman's delays might be due to her own mental state or circumstances, which the man may not fully understand. \n\nThe man's argument about her misleading him regarding her fertility is a bit tricky. If she genuinely believed she couldn't get pregnant due to her condition, even without a doctor's confirmation, that's her perception. However, if she was hiding her past pregnancy and fertility status, that's a breach of trust. Still, the man's response\u2014telling her to get an abortion\u2014could be seen as controlling.\n\nThe woman's hesitation and delays might stem from anxiety, fear, or other emotional factors. The man's frustration is understandable, but it's not his place to dictate her medical choices. The question of whether he's in the wrong hinges on respecting her autonomy versus his own values and concerns about being a parent. \n\nIn summary, while the man's concerns are valid, the woman's right to decide about her body and pregnancy means the man isn't in the right to demand an abortion. His actions may have been inconsiderate, but the core issue is her autonomy. So, the answer would be A (he is in the wrong) if the focus is on respecting her decision. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) if considering the context of their relationship and communication breakdown. But given the emphasis on her right to choose, the answer leans towards A.\n"
