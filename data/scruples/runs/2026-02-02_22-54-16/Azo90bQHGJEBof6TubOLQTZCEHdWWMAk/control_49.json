Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote this post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully. \n\nThe author is a guy who's 22, his girlfriend is 23, and they're in Europe. They started dating in August. The girlfriend said she has PCOS and can't get pregnant, and if she did, she'd just get an abortion. But now she's pregnant, and they found out two weeks ago. She's 8 weeks along. The laws in Denmark say up to 12 weeks it's surgical, before 8 weeks it's chemical. \n\nHe's arguing that she was slow in getting the abortion process going. She forgot to buy a test, slept through the day she was supposed to visit the doctor, and delayed scheduling. He mentions she uses vulgar language about killing the baby. Also, she had a pregnancy 10 years ago which contradicts her claim that she can't get pregnant. He feels she lied about her fertility and didn't act quickly enough, leading to a surgical abortion. He's not in favor of having a child now due to their financial and personal situations. The girl went to the gynecologist and said she didn't want the abortion and asked if he still wanted her to abort. The author is asking if he's at fault for pushing her to get an abortion.\n\nSo, the main points are: 1) The author told her to get an abortion. 2) She delayed the process, which led to a surgical procedure. 3) He's concerned about their ability to support a child. 4) She had a previous pregnancy she didn't mention. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. AITA (Am I the Asshole) often hinges on societal norms, respect, and consent. In many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. The author is pressuring her to have an abortion, which some might see as violating her autonomy. Even if he's against the pregnancy, the decision should be hers. Also, she delayed the process for various reasons, which might affect the procedure's type. However, he's blaming her for not acting faster, which could be seen as invalidating her feelings or circumstances. \n\nHe also mentions she used vulgar language when talking about abortion, which might indicate her own discomfort or trauma. The fact that she had a previous pregnancy is a red flag he points out, but she might have her reasons for not disclosing it. \n\nThe author's stance is that he's not ready for a child and is concerned about their financial and emotional states. However, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is typically the woman's choice. By pressuring her to abort, he might be overstepping, even if he's not in favor of having a child. The key issue here is consent and autonomy. If he's compelling her to make a decision she's not comfortable with, that's problematic. \n\nAdditionally, he mentions she hesitated and questioned his reasons. If she's conflicted, his insistence on abortion without considering her emotional state could be seen as wrong. However, he's also expressing his own inability to support a child, which is a valid concern. The line between being supportive and being controlling is thin here. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might be wrong for not respecting her autonomy and for pressuring her. Even if he shares her initial stance on abortion, the final decision should rest with her. His criticism of her delays and her past pregnancy might also be judgmental. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's imposing his will on her regarding the abortion, which is her decision to make. However, there might be nuances, but in general, the woman's autonomy is paramount in such decisions.\n"
