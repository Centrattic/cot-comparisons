Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the couple is in a relationship, and the girlfriend discovered she's pregnant. The author mentions that she had previously stated she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS and that she would get an abortion if it happened. Now that she is pregnant, she's delayed the process, leading to a need for a surgical abortion. The author is upset because he feels she lied about her fertility and is now hesitating. He's also concerned about the future implications, like her not being able to get pregnant again after the surgical procedure.\n\nKey points here: The girlfriend did mention her PCOS and potential infertility, but there's no official medical confirmation. She had been pregnant before, which she didn't disclose. The author is pressuring her to abort, citing their current life situations (his work, her mental health and financial status). The girlfriend is now hesitant, leading to delays and requiring a more invasive procedure. The author feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and fertility status.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he's not at fault because the decision to abort is mutual, and he's concerned about their readiness for parenthood. The girlfriend's actions\u2014delaying the process and not being upfront\u2014contribute to the conflict. However, the author is pressuring her to make a decision, which might not consider her feelings and autonomy. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many contexts, decisions about pregnancy are personal and complex. Pressuring someone to have an abortion, especially if they are now uncertain about it, can be seen as respecting their autonomy or as being controlling, depending on the circumstances. The girlfriend's initial hesitancy and the author's insistence might both be valid from their perspectives, but the key is how they handle each other's autonomy.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014telling her to abort\u2014could be seen as respecting their mutual decision if they had discussed it beforehand. However, if she is now hesitant and he's pushing for an abortion, that might be overstepping, especially considering the medical risks she mentioned. Additionally, the fact that she withheld information about a past pregnancy could affect the trust in the relationship, but the author's response (telling her to abort) might be seen as a reaction to that breach of trust.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have made decisions that affect each other. The author's decision to tell her to abort is based on their current life circumstances, but the method and timing of the abortion depend on her actions. However, the pressure to make a decision quickly might not account for her emotional state and the medical complications involved.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid points on both sides regarding responsibility and trust, the author's insistence on an abortion despite the girlfriend's hesitation and the potential medical risks might not consider her autonomy fully. Therefore, the answer is B; the author is not in the wrong, but the situation is complex and requires mutual understanding.\n"
