Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the couple is in Europe, Denmark specifically. The girlfriend has PCOS and told the author she couldn't get pregnant. She also mentioned she'd get an abortion if she ever did. Now she's pregnant, and they found out she's 8 weeks along. The author is suggesting she get an abortion, but she's been slow in the process. She's also using vulgar language about killing the baby and changed her stance after the 8-week mark, which means a surgical abortion with higher risk of infertility. She also had a past pregnancy she didn't mention, which the author sees as a red flag.\n\nThe author feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her ability to get pregnant and hiding her past pregnancy. He's concerned about their financial situation, her mental health, and his own ability to handle a child right now. She's hesitant and delayed the process, leading to a more complicated abortion. He doesn't feel bad for her because she could have acted faster.\n\nNow, considering the law in Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. She's at 8 weeks now, so she could have done a chemical abortion earlier if she had acted quickly. The author is pressuring her to abort, which she's now second-guessing. The key points here are consent, autonomy, and whether the author is overstepping by making the decision for her.\n\nIn many cases, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including reproductive choices. The author is not the one carrying the pregnancy, so his opinion might not override her autonomy. However, the girlfriend's behavior seems inconsistent\u2014she initially said she'd abort but now is hesitant. The author is frustrated, but does that make him in the wrong?\n\nThe fact that she withheld information about her past pregnancy and her doctor's diagnosis might be a point. But even if she was dishonest, the author is now pressuring her to terminate, which could be seen as controlling. He's using her delays as a justification for the surgical procedure, but that's her body to decide. The author's main argument is about their readiness for a child, which is valid, but he can't force her to make that choice.\n\nSo, even if her actions were questionable, the author is in a position where he's not the one who has to carry the child. His role here is to support her decision, not dictate it. Pressuring someone to have an abortion, especially when she's now unsure, could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, but actually, maybe A? Wait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the author is pressuring her to abort despite her changing stance, that could be problematic. However, since she initially agreed to abort but delayed, maybe he's justified? But the law is on his side in terms of timing, and her autonomy is key here. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, the question is if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. If she has the right to decide, even if he disagrees, then he's not in the wrong for expressing his opinion. But if he's pressuring her against her wishes, that's different. However, the scenario says she's now hesitant and wants to ask him again. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he's making an informed decision based on their circumstances. Alternatively, maybe he is in the wrong because it's her body. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on their shared life and future, but I'm not entirely sure.\n"
