Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author and their girlfriend are in a relationship, and she got pregnant. She had previously mentioned she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS and that she would get an abortion if that happened. Now, she's 8 weeks pregnant and needs a surgical abortion. The author is upset because she delayed the process, leading to a more invasive procedure. He also found out she had a pregnancy 10 years ago, which he sees as a lie because she claimed infertility. He's concerned about their financial situations, her mental health, and his ability to support a child. The girlfriend is hesitant, using strong language about the abortion, and the author feels she misused his trust.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for pushing for the abortion. Let's break this down. In many places, including Denmark, both partners have a say in decisions like this, but the final decision usually rests with the pregnant individual. The author is making a choice that affects her body and health. Even if he's not the one carrying the pregnancy, he's asserting control over her medical decisions, which can be problematic.\n\nShe delayed the process, but the author is criticizing her for taking longer than necessary. However, her hesitation and the potential risks of a surgical abortion (like future fertility) are her concerns to weigh. The author is pressuring her to make a decision quickly, but she might have her own reasons for being cautious. Also, the fact that he didn't support her when she was hesitant and instead pushed for an abortion, even after she said she wanted to ask him again, suggests he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nHer history of a previous pregnancy and lying about it might be a red flag, but that doesn't necessarily give him the right to dictate her medical choices. The author's concerns about their lifestyles and financial situations are valid, but they should have discussed these issues before the pregnancy. Now that she's pregnant, the decision isn't just about them; it's about her health and future. The author's use of strong language (\"kill the baby\") and her own stress about the situation indicate there's a lot of emotional tension here.\n\nIn terms of ethics and legality, in Denmark, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right. The author shouldn't be the one pressuring her to make that choice. Even if he's not in favor of continuing the pregnancy, he has no legal authority over her medical decisions. His actions could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her autonomy. The key here is that reproductive decisions are her own, and while partners can influence each other, they can't make the decision for the other person.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is advising his girlfriend to have an abortion, which she's hesitant about. He's using the information about the surgical risks and their current situations to justify his stance. But the core issue is that he's not respecting her right to make her own decision, even if he disagrees with her timeline or hesitancy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's imposing his will on her medical choices.\n"
