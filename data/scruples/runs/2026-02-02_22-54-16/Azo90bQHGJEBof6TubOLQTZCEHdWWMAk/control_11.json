Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for advising his girlfriend to get an abortion. So, the key points here are the situation, his actions, and the context.\n\nFirst, the couple is in a relationship where the woman has PCOS and previously told him she couldn't get pregnant. She also mentioned that if she ever did get pregnant, she would abort it. Now she's pregnant, and there's some conflict about the abortion process in Denmark. The user is 22, she's 23, both in Europe (Denmark). \n\nThe woman delayed getting the necessary appointments for the abortion, leading to a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one. There's a mention of her mental health, financial situation (on welfare), and previous undisclosed pregnancy. The user feels she misrepresented her fertility and hesitated in the process, which he attributes to not wanting to go through with the abortion. He's upset because she didn't reschedule immediately and now is questioning him about his reasons for wanting her to abort.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The main issue is his decision to advise her to abort. In many relationships, decisions about pregnancy are mutual, but there's a line when one person is pressuring the other. However, the woman initially said she would abort if pregnant. Now she's hesitant, but he's pushing her again. The problem arises if he's pressuring her when she's not certain. However, the woman's actions (delaying the process) suggest she might be ambivalent. \n\nLegally, in Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. She's at 8 weeks, so technically she can still choose either method. The user is suggesting she get an abortion, which she initially agreed to. However, her hesitation and the delays complicate things. The user feels she misrepresented her fertility and her past pregnancy, which he sees as a betrayal of trust.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while the woman's delays might be frustrating, the user's insistence on the abortion could be seen as controlling, especially if he's not allowing her autonomy in the decision. However, given that she initially told him she would abort and now is showing ambivalence, he might feel justified. The key question is whether he's in the wrong for advising her to proceed, especially if she's not fully committed.\n\nBut looking at the situation, he didn't force her to do it; he was advising her based on their circumstances. The woman's own hesitation and delays led to the need for a surgical procedure, which he's now citing as her responsibility. The user is frustrated because she didn't act quickly enough, leading to complications in the abortion process. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't forcing her to have the abortion, but he is expressing his opinion. The woman is making the medical decisions, but his pressure might be influencing her. However, since she initially agreed to abort and now is hesitant, his stance could be seen as consistent. The fact that she didn't act promptly and is changing her mind might exonerate him from being in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle is the trust issue. She disclosed her past pregnancy after they found out about the current one, which he sees as a red flag. This could affect his trust in her, but that doesn't necessarily make him at fault for advising the abortion. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the woman initially agreed to abort, he's being honest about his ability to support a child now, and her delays led to complications. However, the pressure he might be applying could be a point of contention. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and he's not forcing her to do anything, it's possible he's not in the wrong.\n"
