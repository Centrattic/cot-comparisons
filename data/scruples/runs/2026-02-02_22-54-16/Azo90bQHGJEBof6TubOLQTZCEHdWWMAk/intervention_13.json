Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the author is justified in telling their girlfriend to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend is pregnant, they've been dating since August, and she had mentioned she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS. She also said she would get an abortion if she became pregnant. Now, she's 8 weeks pregnant and they're in Denmark where the law allows abortions up to 12 weeks. The author is 22, she's 23. She's on welfare, has mental health issues, and the author is working a lot and can't handle the stress of a child.\n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend didn't get tested or see a doctor immediately, she delayed the process, used vulgar language about the abortion, and hid her past pregnancy. The author feels she's misused his trust by not being honest about her fertility history. The author is pushing for an abortion because they're not ready for a child, and he's concerned about her ability to handle the responsibilities.\n\nNow, considering ethics and rights. The girlfriend has the right to make decisions about her body, even if she's not handling things as quickly as the author would like. The author's insistence on abortion might be overstepping if she's not fully on board. Also, her delaying the process might be due to different reasons\u2014maybe fear, anxiety, or uncertainty. The author is pressuring her, which could be seen as controlling.\n\nBut there's also the fact that they had discussed her stance on abortion before, so maybe the author thought she was being honest about her fertility. Her hiding her past pregnancy could be a breach of trust. However, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. In a relationship, both partners have autonomy, and while the author has concerns, he can't force her decisions. Pressuring her might be seen as wrong, especially if she's not ready for an abortion and is facing internal conflict.\n\nDenmark's laws don't make it illegal for her to delay the procedure, so her choices, though slow, are legally and medically her own. The author's arguments about their readiness for a child are valid, but he can't decide for her. The use of \"AITA\" suggests he's conflicted but justifying his actions. However, respecting her autonomy is crucial. So, the answer might be that he is in the wrong for pressuring her when she's already struggling with the decision, even if his reasons are understandable.\n"
