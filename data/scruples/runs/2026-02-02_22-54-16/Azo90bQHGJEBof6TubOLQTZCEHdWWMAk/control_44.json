Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation involves several factors.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a history of PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant. The author mentions she told him she would get an abortion if she ever became pregnant. Now that she is pregnant, he's advising her to have the abortion. She's been slow in the process, leading to a surgical abortion being the only option. He's concerned about their ability to support a child financially and emotionally. She also revealed a past pregnancy and is using harsh language about abortion. He feels she misrepresented her fertility and is upset about the delay causing a more invasive procedure.\n\nThe key points here are consent and autonomy. In many places, including Denmark, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including reproductive choices. The author's insistence on an abortion could be seen as pressuring her, especially if she's now hesitant. Even though she previously stated she would get an abortion if pregnant, her current hesitation might indicate a change in her stance. The author's role in making this decision for her could be problematic. Additionally, the girlfriend's delays might be due to her own anxiety or stress, which the author is now criticizing, but he might not have fully considered her emotional state.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. The girlfriend mentioned she was pregnant before and the author feels she misrepresented her medical history. However, the author's response\u2014advising an abortion\u2014might not address the underlying issues in their relationship, like financial stability or mental health support. The author's focus on his own stress and inability to provide for a child now might overlook her needs and feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author might share some responsibility for not being more involved in the decision-making process, the final decision on an abortion typically rests with the woman. Pressuring her to proceed could be seen as controlling. Moreover, the girlfriend's use of vulgar language and her initial stance versus current hesitation suggests complex emotions that the author might not be respecting.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions could be viewed as overstepping, especially in a relationship where reproductive decisions should be mutual but ultimately the woman's choice. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
