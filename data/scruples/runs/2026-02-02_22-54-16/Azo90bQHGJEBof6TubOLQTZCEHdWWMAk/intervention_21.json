Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old guy in a relationship with a 23-year-old girl in Europe, specifically Denmark. They've been dating since August, and the girlfriend mentioned she has PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) and couldn't get pregnant. She also said if she ever got pregnant, she'd just get an abortion without any issues. The problem is, she did get pregnant, and now there's conflict over what to do.\n\nThe main points from the author's perspective are that the girlfriend was very slow in getting the abortion process started. She forgot to buy a test, overslept on the day she was supposed to see the doctor, and delayed getting an appointment. The author points out that in Denmark, you can get immediate appointments for free, so there's no financial barrier. He's frustrated because she took longer than necessary, leading to a surgical abortion (which has higher risks) instead of a chemical one. The author also mentions that she used vulgar language about the baby, called it \"killing the baby,\" and didn't reschedule the appointment when she had the chance, leading to the need for surgery.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend revealed she had been pregnant around 10 years ago, which the author sees as a red flag. He thinks she misrepresented her fertility history by saying she couldn't get pregnant when no doctor actually confirmed that. The author also feels she's using him financially and emotionally, as she's on welfare and has mental health issues, and she expects him to support her without her working towards independence.\n\nThe author's main concern is that the girlfriend's delays and lack of urgency caused the situation to escalate to a surgical abortion, which has potential complications. He feels she didn't take the process seriously and is now being hesitant. He also mentions that he's not ready for a child and that they both aren't in a good position financially or emotionally to have a kid.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. Let's consider the ethical aspects. In many cultures, especially in Europe, abortion is a legal right, and individuals have the right to make decisions about their bodies. The girlfriend is the one who is pregnant, so ultimately, the decision rests with her. However, the author is involved emotionally and financially, and their relationship is affected by this.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014delaying the process and then changing her mind\u2014could be seen as inconsistent. She initially said she'd get an abortion without hesitation, but now she's hesitating. The author points out that her delays led to a riskier procedure and that she's now showing signs of wanting to carry the pregnancy to term. However, if the woman changes her mind, it's her right, even if it was unexpected.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He's concerned about the financial strain, their readiness, and the girlfriend's mental health. However, pressuring someone to terminate a pregnancy, even if it's legal, can be seen as violating her autonomy, especially if she's now decided against it. The girlfriend might be conflicted, and the author's insistence could add stress.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's history of pregnancy and PCOS might be relevant. If she wasn't told she couldn't get pregnant, then her initial statements were possibly misleading. The author's trust was broken, which adds to his emotional response. But does that justify his stance?\n\nIn terms of rights, the woman has the legal and moral right to make decisions about her pregnancy. The author's role is to support her, even if he disagrees. Pressuring her could strain the relationship and affect her well-being. The author's actions might come from a place of concern, but it's important to respect her autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is sharing his perspective that he feels wronged because of her actions. He mentions feeling that she misused his trust and that her delays caused complications. He's also stressed about their financial situation and readiness. His position isn't entirely without basis, but the key issue is who has the authority to decide the pregnancy's outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns and the girlfriend's actions might be seen as inconsistent, the ultimate decision rests with the woman. Pressuring her to abort could be seen as infringing on her rights, even if he believes it's the right choice for both of them. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
