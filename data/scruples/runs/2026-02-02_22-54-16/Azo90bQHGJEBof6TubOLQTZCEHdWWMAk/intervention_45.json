Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether they told their girlfriend to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand all the facts. The couple is in a relationship started in August. The girlfriend has PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant. She also said she'd get an abortion if she ever did. They found out she's pregnant at 8 weeks. The author is suggesting she should abort, and she's been slow in the process, leading to a surgical abortion. She's also revealed a past pregnancy and uses vulgar language about killing the baby. The author is frustrated because she didn't act quickly and hid her past pregnancy.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and consent. The girlfriend told him she couldn't get pregnant, which turned out to be untrue. Also, she delayed the abortion process, which made it more complicated. The author is upset that she didn't act promptly and felt she used his trust. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, when it comes to pregnancy decisions, both partners usually share in the decision-making. However, the girlfriend is the one who can make the medical decision. The author is voicing his opinion, which is valid, but he's not forcing her. The issue might be more about her not being honest about her fertility and past pregnancies, which could be a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's main concerns are about readiness for parenthood and her current situation. He's not being overly controlling but is honest about his limitations. The girlfriend's hesitation and delays might be the bigger issue here. However, the author did ask her to abort, which could be seen as pressuring her, but given the circumstances, maybe it's justified.\n\nLegally, in Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, so the timing is within the limit. The author's argument that she could have done a chemical abortion if she acted faster is valid. The girlfriend's delays led to the need for surgery, which she herself mentioned carries risks.\n\nThe use of vulgar language about killing the baby might be a red flag for how she views the situation, but the author's response is to express his stance clearly, which he's entitled to do.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong because he's expressing his honest opinion about not being ready for a child and pointing out her dishonesty about her fertility. The main issues lie with the girlfriend's actions and decisions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
