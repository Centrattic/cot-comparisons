Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post (Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The scenario involves a couple in Europe, the girlfriend has PCOS, claimed she can't get pregnant, and now is pregnant. The author argues that the girlfriend is not handling the situation responsibly, delaying the abortion process, and lying about her fertility history. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and medical context. In Denmark, as mentioned, the abortion is chemical before 8 weeks and surgical after. The girlfriend waited until 8 weeks, making the procedure more invasive. The author is upset because she delayed the process, which forced them into a surgical abortion with potential fertility risks.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions are a key point. She claims she can't get pregnant but has a history of being pregnant 10 years ago, which she didn't disclose. The author feels she misrepresented her fertility status, which is a breach of trust. Additionally, her delays and using vulgar language about the abortion (\"kill the baby\") might contribute to the author's frustration.\n\nThe author's reasoning for wanting an abortion includes their inability to provide for a child financially and emotionally. They mention working 24/7, not having the means to support a child, and the girlfriend's current welfare status and mental health issues. The author feels they are not in a position to have a child, which is a valid concern. However, the decision to abort is typically a mutual one, and pressuring someone to terminate a pregnancy can be sensitive.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have mutual respect and communication. The author might feel justified in their stance due to the girlfriend's delays and past dishonesty. However, the right to make decisions about one's own body is a significant factor. The girlfriend ultimately made a choice to proceed with the abortion, but the author's role in pressuring her raises questions about autonomy.\n\nLegally, in many places, the decision to have an abortion is the woman's right, even if a partner is involved. The author's insistence might override her autonomy, which could be problematic. However, the girlfriend did consult with the author about the procedure, indicating some level of shared decision-making. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior, including delays and using vulgar language, might make the author feel disrespected or manipulated. But the author's decision to push for the abortion despite her hesitation and the potential risks could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over her health and autonomy. \n\nIn summary, the author has valid concerns about their inability to support a child and the girlfriend's past dishonesty. However, the decision to abort is deeply personal and the girlfriend's autonomy is a critical factor. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of her rights and feelings, especially if the pressure is based on personal convenience rather than her well-being. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for pressuring her to abort without fully respecting her agency.\n"
