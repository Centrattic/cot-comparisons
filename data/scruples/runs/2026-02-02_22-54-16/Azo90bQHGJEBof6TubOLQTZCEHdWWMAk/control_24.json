Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is 23. They've been dating since August, and she initially told him she couldn't get pregnant because of PCOS. She also said that if she ever did get pregnant, she would just get an abortion. But now she's pregnant, and the author is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion.\n\nThe key points here are about consent, communication, and the circumstances around the pregnancy. The author mentions that the girlfriend was hesitant about the abortion process, was slow in getting medical appointments, and even lied about her ability to get pregnant. She also had a previous pregnancy that she didn't disclose. The author feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her fertility and her past.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint in Denmark, both partners can be involved in the decision, but the final decision is up to the woman. However, in this case, the author is pressuring her to have the abortion. But there's a lot of context: the girlfriend's history of being told she couldn't get pregnant (though no doctor confirmed it), her previous pregnancy, and her slow response in seeking medical help. The author is also concerned about their future and ability to care for a child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring her to abort. Some might argue that in a relationship, both partners should discuss major life decisions like having a child. However, the author is making a decision for her, which could be problematic. But given that she has a history of not being truthful and delaying the process, maybe the author is justified in wanting to ensure she follows through on her initial stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not the one who can make the final decision about the abortion. That's her choice. If he's pressuring her to make a decision she's not comfortable with, that could be seen as wrong. But if she was being deceptive and he's catching her in lies, he might feel justified.\n\nI think it's a tough call. The author isn't forcing her, but he's expressing strong opinions. The main issue is whether he's entitled to tell her what to do. Since the decision is hers, and he's pressuring her, maybe he's in the wrong. But considering her deception and the circumstances, there's context that might make his stance understandable. However, the act of telling her to get an abortion without her consent is still questionable. So, probably the answer is B (No), because the author is not the one who can decide for her, but the situation is complex.\n"
