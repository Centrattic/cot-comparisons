Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author, a 22-year-old in Europe, is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is 23. They've been dating since mid-August. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. She always said that if she did get pregnant, she'd get an abortion. Now, two weeks ago, she found out she's pregnant and is 8 weeks along. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, let's look at the timeline. The girlfriend mentioned she couldn't get pregnant and that an abortion would be straightforward. However, she had some delays in getting tested and scheduling a doctor's appointment. The author points out that in Denmark, you can get immediate appointments and that she didn't do that, leading to a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one. He's upset because she's now questioning his reasons for wanting an abortion, despite him being clear about his stance. She uses vulgar language about the abortion, calling it \"killing the baby,\" and mentions she might not be able to get pregnant again if she has the surgical procedure. The author is frustrated that she hid her past pregnancy and that her PCOS diagnosis might not be the absolute reason she can't conceive. He also mentions her current financial situation and mental health issues, which he's helping with, but she's not working towards independence.\n\nNow, the main question is: is the author in the wrong for suggesting she get an abortion? Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side, he's making a choice based on his current life circumstances. He's working 24/7, can't handle the stress of a child, and they both aren't in a position to have one. He's being honest about his stance and is concerned about their futures. The girlfriend seems to have changed her mind or is hesitant, leading to delays. The author feels she misrepresented her fertility and withheld information. He's not forcing her to get the abortion; he's expressing his own position.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side, she was clear about her stance on abortion initially. Now, she's second-guessing, which could be due to the reality of the situation. She might be struggling with the emotional aspect of the decision. Her delays might be due to anxiety or fear, not just procrastination. Also, she's mentioned the potential infertility risk with the surgical procedure, which adds complexity. She's on welfare, has mental health issues, which could affect her decision-making.\n\nThe author is asking for validation on Reddit, which is a platform where people share their stories and get opinions. The question is whether he's at fault for advocating for an abortion given the circumstances. Legally, in Denmark, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks, so she still has options. The author isn't making her do anything; he's stating his position and the reasons why he thinks she should proceed. She's the one making the final decision, but he's upset with her for not acting quickly and hiding past pregnancy, which might have influenced his trust.\n\nIn terms of ethics, everyone has the right to make reproductive choices. The author is respecting that she has the final say but is frustrated by her actions. He's not pressuring her beyond stating his own stance. However, he is critical of her for not being proactive and for the delays. The key here is whether he's overstepping by expressing his opinion. Since it's a joint decision, but the ultimate responsibility lies with her as the pregnant person, the author's stance isn't inherently wrong. However, his frustration might stem from feeling she's not being honest or proactive, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The act of suggesting an abortion, especially in a situation where both partners have discussed it beforehand, isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be in how he's handling it, like not being supportive of her emotional state or not compromising. However, the scenario doesn't indicate coercion. The author is not forcing her but expressing his position. The girlfriend is the one making the final decision, albeit with delays and hesitation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting the abortion based on their circumstances. The issue is more about the girlfriend's actions and the communication between them. The author's stance is based on their shared understanding and his current life situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
