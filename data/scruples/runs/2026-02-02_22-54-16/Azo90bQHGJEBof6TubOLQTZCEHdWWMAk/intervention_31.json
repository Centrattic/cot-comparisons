Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for advising his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the couple met in August, and the girlfriend had PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant. She also said she'd get an abortion if she ever became pregnant. Now, she is pregnant. The author argues that she delayed the process, leading to a surgical abortion being necessary instead of a chemical one. He lists reasons like her being on welfare, having mental health issues, and not being ready for a child. He also found out she had a past pregnancy, which he sees as a red flag.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't reschedule the abortion and instead asked the author again, but he's upset with her for not acting faster. However, she was the one who was hesitant and had already decided against the abortion when speaking to the doctor. The author is pressuring her to proceed, but she's the one who has the right to make decisions about her own body. Even if she delayed, her reasons for hesitation might be valid, and the author's insistence could be seen as controlling. Also, the fact that he's using her past pregnancy against her and making her feel like she misused his trust could be problematic. His well-being and future are concerns, but ultimately, the decision isn't his to make. So, the author might be in the wrong for pressuring her into an abortion she's not fully committed to, especially after she expressed hesitancy.\n"
