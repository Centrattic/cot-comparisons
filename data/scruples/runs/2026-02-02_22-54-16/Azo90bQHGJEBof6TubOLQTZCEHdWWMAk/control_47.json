Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nSo, the author is a 22-year-old guy in Europe, probably Denmark since they mentioned the law there. He's in a relationship with his girlfriend, who is 23. They started dating in August. She had PCOS and previously said she couldn't get pregnant. She also mentioned that if she ever did get pregnant, she would just get an abortion. Now, she's pregnant, and they found out two weeks ago. The doctor said she's 8 weeks along, which in Denmark means a surgical abortion is needed between 8-12 weeks. Before that, it's a chemical one.\n\nThe girlfriend delayed the process: she forgot to buy a test, slept through the day she was supposed to visit the doctor, and took three days to get a new appointment. Plus, her initial appointment was a week later than possible. Now, she's hesitating about the abortion, questioning his reasons for wanting it. The author lists reasons like his 24/7 work schedule, her being on welfare, her mental health, and his inability to handle more stress. The girlfriend uses vulgar language when talking about the abortion, like \"kill the baby.\" She also revealed she was pregnant 10 years ago, which he sees as a red flag because she claimed she couldn't get pregnant before. No doctor actually confirmed her infertility, and he's upset she didn't reschedule the abortion quickly enough, leading to needing a surgical one. He's also upset she didn't tell him about her previous pregnancy.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. \n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In Denmark, both partners can request an abortion, but the decision is ultimately the woman's. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for advocating for the abortion.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend didn't reschedule quickly. The author mentions she delayed the process, which led to needing surgery. However, the law allows her to make that decision. If she's hesitating now, maybe her position has changed. But the author is pushing for the abortion, which is her decision. He might be pressuring her, which could be problematic. Also, she initially said she would get an abortion, but now she's hesitating. The author might be reacting to her change of heart.\n\nHe's also upset that she didn't disclose her previous pregnancy. If she lied about her fertility history, that's a big deal. But the author's role here is to support her in her decision-making. Even if she delayed, the decision to abort is hers. The author's pressure could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn many contexts, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including pregnancy. The author's insistence on the abortion might be in the wrong if it's imposing his will on her. However, since the girlfriend's actions led to the delay, maybe the author is justified in his frustration. But the core issue is whether he has the right to demand the abortion. The answer likely hinges on whether he's overstepping by pressuring her, especially if she's now uncertain.\n\nThe author might be in the right because he's concerned about his ability to support a child and her circumstances. But if he's pressuring her to abort against her wishes now, that's a problem. However, the girlfriend's initial stance was to abort, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if she's now changed her mind, he might be wrong to push for it. The situation is complex.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions depend on her current wishes. If she's now against the abortion, he's in the wrong for pressuring her. If she's still considering it but hesitating, his frustration might be understandable. However, since she has the final say, the author should respect her decision regardless of his own. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong if he's forcing her to abort against her will now.\n"

  "answer": "B",
  "full_response": "B. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong. Key factors include his explicit stance against having a child currently, her initial assertions about not wanting children, her delays in seeking prompt care (which increased medical risks), and her withholding of relevant personal history. While the decision to terminate ultimately rests with the pregnant person, the author\u2019s concerns about his ability to support a child and her circumstances are valid. His frustration stems from her actions (delays, withheld information) and misaligned priorities, not from coercing her decision. The core issue is her autonomy, but the author\u2019s role here is not to force her choice but to express his position clearly. His actions do not constitute wrongdoing in this context.",
