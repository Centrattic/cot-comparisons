Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the couple is young, 22 and 23. They've been dating since August. The GF has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. She always said if she ever got pregnant, she'd abort. But now she is pregnant. The author is suggesting she get an abortion, and she's hesitant, leading to delays in the process. The author is upset because she didn't act quickly, leading to a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. He also found out she had a past pregnancy, which she hadn't mentioned, and he feels she lied about her fertility.\n\nThe author is frustrated with her delays and her attitude towards the abortion. He mentions her using vulgar language about killing the baby, which he finds offensive. He's concerned about their ability to handle a child right now, given their financial situations and his work schedule. The GF is on welfare, has mental health issues, and he's helping her financially as long as she works towards a future.\n\nThe author feels she misused his trust by claiming she couldn't get pregnant when no doctor confirmed that, and hiding her past pregnancy. He's not comfortable with having a kid yet, which he's made clear. The GF went to the gynecologist but didn't reschedule quickly enough, leading to a surgical procedure. The author doesn't feel bad for her because she delayed the process.\n\nNow, considering ethics and responsibility. The key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring her to have an abortion. In many contexts, reproductive rights are a personal choice, and the partner's influence can be a complex issue. The author's stance is that he's not ready for a child and has valid reasons based on their current life situations. However, he's making a decision that directly affects her body and her reproductive choices, which can be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe GF's delays and her hesitation could indicate that she's conflicted, which the author is now using against her. However, the author's frustration seems justified given her initial claims about being unable to get pregnant and her past pregnancy. There's a contradiction there that the author is now pointing out. \n\nThe use of vulgar language by the GF when discussing abortion might be a red flag, but it's unclear how much that affects the author's responsibility. The author's main argument is about their inability to support a child now, which is a legitimate concern. However, the final decision about an abortion is typically the woman's right, and the author's insistence might infringe on that. \n\nConsidering the legal context in Denmark, where the law allows for abortion up to 12 weeks, the author's pressure to act quickly could be seen as pressuring her for a decision. The delays in her seeking care might be due to her own hesitations, which the author is now using to justify his stance. \n\nIn terms of trust issues, the GF did mention she couldn't get pregnant, but it's possible she misunderstood her PCOS diagnosis. If no doctor confirmed her infertility, then technically she was misinformed, not necessarily lying. However, the author is now holding that against her, which complicates things. \n\nThe author's main wrongdoing could be pressuring her for a decision that is ultimately hers. Even if she made mistakes in the process, the decision to abort should be hers. The author's frustration is valid, but his insistence on her proceeding might be overstepping. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about their future and is honest about not wanting a child yet. He's also pointing out her delays and inconsistencies. The situation is complex, but the key factor is the right to reproductive autonomy. The author's role in pressuring her for an abortion, despite her hesitation, could be seen as in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's making a decision that affects her reproductive rights, even if his concerns are valid. However, some might argue that since they are in a relationship and the author is sharing his concerns, it's not entirely his fault. But the line is crossed when he's pressuring her for a decision that is hers alone. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
