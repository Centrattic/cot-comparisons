Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their girlfriend to abort a pregnancy, and then questioning her decisions and past.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The girlfriend had PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant, but it turns out she had a past pregnancy. The author found out she was pregnant, and she's been delaying the abortion process, leading to a surgical procedure. The author is upset because she used vulgar language about abortion, didn't reschedule the appointment, and now the author feels she's been untruthful about her fertility.\n\nThe author argues that he never wanted a child yet and was clear about that. He also points out her financial issues and that she relies on welfare. He feels betrayed because she hid her past pregnancy and didn't act quickly enough to have a chemical abortion. The key points here are the trust issues, the pressure to abort, and the girlfriend's actions.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In terms of legal and ethical standards, both partners should have mutual consent on reproductive decisions. The author is pressuring her to abort, but he has the right to his opinion. However, the girlfriend has the final say on her own body. The author isn't forcing her; he's expressing his stance. \n\nThe author's frustration might be valid given the circumstances, but does that make him in the wrong? He isn't the one deciding the abortion for her. However, there might be issues with how he's handling the situation. For instance, questioning her decisions and being critical of her process could be seen as disrespectful. Also, the fact that he used her past pregnancy as a red flag might indicate judgment towards her previous choices, which could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions\u2014delaying the procedure, using vulgar language, and hiding her past pregnancy\u2014also contribute to the conflict. The author might feel betrayed, but he's not the one making her have the abortion. His stance is based on their current life situations and future plans. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't forcing her to abort, but he is pressuring her to do so. The ethical line here is thin. However, since the decision to abort is ultimately hers, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his desire for an abortion. The key is that he isn't controlling her decision but is sharing his concerns. \n\nHowever, the way he's handling it\u2014judging her delays, questioning her trust, and using the past pregnancy against her\u2014might be where he could be at fault. But according to the AITA framework, the focus is on whether he did something wrong. Since he's not making her make a decision she doesn't want, but rather voicing his own stance, he might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's autonomy is the main factor here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because he's expressing his own position without forcing her to comply. However, there's room for criticism in how he's approaching the situation, but legally and ethically, he isn't the one making the decision for her.\n"
