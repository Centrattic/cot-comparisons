Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author asked their girlfriend to get an abortion. The girlfriend has PCOS and previously said she couldn't get pregnant. Now that she is pregnant, she wants to keep the baby, which the author is against. The author lists several reasons: his work schedule, financial stress, and the girlfriend's reliance on welfare and mental health issues. The girlfriend is hesitant about the abortion, delayed in getting an appointment, and lied about her fertility history.\n\nFirst, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to abort. Let's break down the key points. The girlfriend had led him to believe she couldn't get pregnant, but she actually had been pregnant before. The author is concerned about their readiness for parenthood. However, the decision to have an abortion is very personal and complex. Even if the author and girlfriend are not ready, the final decision should ideally be mutual. But in this case, the author is pressuring her to abort, which might be a problem if her autonomy is being disregarded.\n\nThe girlfriend's hesitation and delays might be due to emotional factors, not just being slow. She might be conflicted about the decision. The author's frustration with the delays and her using vulgar language about abortion could indicate a lack of respect for her feelings. Also, the fact that she didn't reschedule the appointment might be a red flag about her commitment to aborting the pregnancy, leading to the need for a surgical procedure, which the author seems to resent.\n\nThe author's reasons for wanting the abortion are valid in terms of readiness, but the way he's handling the situation might be unethical. Pressuring a partner to have an abortion against her will is a major issue. Even if there are shared concerns, the decision should be mutual. The girlfriend's autonomy in making decisions about her body is crucial. The author's actions could be seen as controlling, especially since he's not allowing her to make her own choice, even if he disagrees with her stance on keeping the baby.\n\nAlso, the author is upset that she lied about her fertility history. While that's a valid concern, it doesn't necessarily justify pressuring her to abort now. The key point is whether he's respecting her autonomy. If she's decided to keep the baby despite his objections, he needs to support her decision or consider the relationship's future. Pressuring her to abort because of his own readiness issues could be seen as wrong, as it's her body and her child.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her decision-making autonomy regarding her body. Even if he's concerned about their readiness, the final decision should be hers, not something he's pressuring her into. The fact that she's hesitant and delayed might indicate her own internal conflict, and his reaction could be exacerbating the situation instead of supporting her through it.\n"
