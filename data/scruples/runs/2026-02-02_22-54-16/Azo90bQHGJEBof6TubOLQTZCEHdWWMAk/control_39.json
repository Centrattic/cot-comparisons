Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author asking their girlfriend to get an abortion. The girlfriend had previously said she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS and would get an abortion if she ever did. Now they found out she's pregnant, but she delayed the process, leading to needing a surgical abortion with higher risks. The author is upset she didn't act faster and is questioning her about their future ability to have kids.\n\nFirst, the author is pressuring the girlfriend to abort. The girlfriend's decision to have an abortion is her personal choice, and the author's role in pushing for it might be problematic. Even if they discussed their views on parenthood, the final decision should rest with her. The author's use of \"AITA\" suggests they see their request as justified, but maybe not considering her autonomy.\n\nThe girlfriend's delays might be due to personal reasons, mental health issues, or lack of support. The author criticizes her for being slow, but maybe she's struggling with the decision emotionally. Also, the author mentions her past pregnancy that she didn't disclose, which is a red flag, but withholding that info is on her. However, the author's main action is asking her to abort, which is a significant decision.\n\nIn terms of rights, the woman has the autonomy over her body. The author's insistence might infringe on that. Even if the author has valid concerns about their future, they can't dictate her medical decisions. The girlfriend's hesitation and the delays could be due to her own stress or uncertainty, not just inconsiderate behavior.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's actions might be questionable (hiding past pregnancy, delays), the author's main issue is pressuring her to abort, which is a violation of her autonomy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting her decision-making process and autonomy over her body.\n"
