Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (let's call them AITA) is in a relationship with their girlfriend, who got pregnant. They had been told previously that she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS. Now she's pregnant and they're both deciding what to do.\n\nFirst, the author is asking if they're at fault for telling their GF to get an abortion. The key points here are the girlfriend's history of saying she couldn't get pregnant but actually was pregnant before, and now she's delaying the process. The author is concerned about their ability to support a child, their work, and her financial situation. They also mention that the girlfriend used vulgar language about the abortion and changed her stance on it. The author feels that she misrepresented her fertility and withheld information about a past pregnancy.\n\nSo, the main issue seems to be whether the author was wrong to suggest the abortion. Let's break it down. The author is in a new relationship, they started dating in August, and the pregnancy happened quickly. The girlfriend had PCOS but no official diagnosis stating she couldn't get pregnant. The author mentions that they explicitly said they weren't ready for a child. The girlfriend delayed medical appointments, leading to a more invasive procedure, which the author is upset about.\n\nNow, considering the laws in Denmark, the author is correct about the time frames for abortion types. The girlfriend's hesitation and delays are a problem from the author's perspective. The author also feels misled because the girlfriend claimed not to be able to get pregnant but had been pregnant before. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, in terms of suggesting an abortion, it's a personal medical decision. However, the author is putting pressure on the girlfriend to make a decision based on their own reasons. The girlfriend's autonomy is important here. The author might be overstepping by pushing for an abortion, especially if the girlfriend is hesitant. However, the author is also concerned about future plans and their ability to support a child. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014delaying the process, using vulgar language, and not being honest about her past pregnancy\u2014could contribute to the author's frustration. However, the author's role in the decision-making process might be problematic. Each person has the right to their own reproductive choices, and the author might be imposing their will on the girlfriend. The fact that the author is pressuring her to abort could be seen as wrong, regardless of the reasons, because it's her body and decision to make.\n\nBut the author is also justified in feeling misled. If the girlfriend had been honest from the start about her past pregnancy and the uncertainty about her fertility, maybe the situation could have been handled differently. However, the decision to abort should ultimately be hers, not influenced by the partner's financial or readiness issues unless there's mutual agreement.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concerns are valid, pressuring someone to make a medical decision, especially in a new relationship, could be considered wrong. The girlfriend's delays and dishonesty are on her, but the author's insistence on abortion might infringe on her autonomy. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing their stance, given the circumstances. It's a complex situation where both parties have issues, but the core question is about the author's right to push for an abortion. Since the abortion decision is primarily the woman's, the author might be overstepping, making the answer A (yes, at fault), but the reasoning is nuanced.\n"
