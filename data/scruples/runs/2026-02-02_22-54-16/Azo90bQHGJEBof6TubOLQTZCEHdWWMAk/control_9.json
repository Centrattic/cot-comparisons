Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is asking if he's at fault for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. The girlfriend has PCOS and has been saying she can't get pregnant, but she was pregnant. She's been slow in dealing with the pregnancy, leading to needing a surgical abortion now. She also mentioned a past pregnancy that she didn't tell him about. He's concerned about their financial situations and future plans, and he's not ready for a kid. She's been using harsh language about the abortion and hesitated to proceed, which made him suggest the abortion. Now he's feeling like she lied about her fertility and withheld info.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context in Denmark. The law allows abortion up to 12 weeks, which she's at 8 weeks now. She could have done a chemical abortion earlier if she acted quickly. The guy is worried about their ability to support a child, which is a valid concern. However, the decision to have an abortion is a personal one and typically the woman's choice. The fact that the author is pressuring her or telling her what to do might be problematic. Even if they don't want a child, the woman has autonomy over her body. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is also a point. She was slow in getting the process started, maybe due to her own hesitations, and she withheld past pregnancy info. But the author's role in telling her to abort could be seen as controlling. In relationships, both partners should discuss major decisions, but the final say on medical decisions should be the woman's. The author's reasoning about their future and stress is understandable, but pushing her to make a choice might infringe on her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction to the girl's hesitation\u2014feeling she's misused his trust\u2014might be valid, but it doesn't justify pressuring her towards an abortion. He might be projecting his own stress onto her. However, her not being honest about her medical history is her fault. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by telling her to abort. Since the decision is hers, advising her to abort could be seen as overstepping, especially if he's making it conditional on their relationship. But since they both agree not to have kids yet, maybe it's a mutual decision. However, the way he's handling it, without respecting her agency, could be problematic. \n\nThe answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because he's pressuring her to make a medical decision. But there's also context about their mutual intentions. However, the key point is autonomy. Even if they both don't want a child, the final decision should be hers. If he's making her feel forced, that's an issue. So probably A.\n"
