Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is a guy in a relationship with a woman who has PCOS and claims she can't get pregnant. They found out she's pregnant, and she initially said she'd get an abortion. But now she's hesitating, causing delays that mean a surgical procedure instead of a pill. She also lied about not being pregnant before (had a pregnancy 10 years ago) and maybe misrepresented her fertility. The guy is upset because he doesn't want kids right now, and he feels she's being irresponsible. He's questioning her decisions and even using strong language when she talks about abortion.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. Let's look at the key points. The woman's actions: she delayed the process, which led to needing a surgical abortion. She lied about her medical history. She changed her mind about the abortion after initially saying she would do it. The guy, on the other hand, is expressing his reasons why they can't have a child right now\u2014work stress, financial issues, etc. He's not forcing her, but he's clearly against it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the woman made decisions that led to the current situation. She delayed medical appointments, which affected the type of procedure. She also didn't mention her previous pregnancy, which is a red flag. The guy is reacting to her actions. He's not forcing her to abort; he's voicing his opinion based on their current circumstances.\n\nBut here's the catch: in many cultures and legal contexts, both partners have a say in reproductive decisions. However, the woman has the legal right to make decisions about her own body. The guy might feel wronged because she didn't act as he expected, but does that make him right to tell her to abort? Or is the woman responsible for her own choices?\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if he's pressuring her to make a decision that she's hesitant about, that could be problematic. But in this case, the woman initially agreed to an abortion but delayed the process. Now she's hesitant, and the guy is frustrated. He's not forcing her; he's stating his position. However, the way he's handling it\u2014using strong language and questioning her decisions\u2014might not be supportive. Also, her using vulgar language about abortion could indicate her own stress or trauma, but that doesn't excuse her delays.\n\nAnother angle: the woman's health. The guy mentions the risk of surgical abortion affecting her fertility. If she's aware of that risk and still choosing the surgical option, maybe that's her choice. But the guy is concerned about their future ability to have kids, which is valid.\n\nThe user's main issue is that he feels she misused his trust by lying about her medical history and delaying the process. But is that enough to say he's in the wrong? Or is he just upset about her actions and the situation they're in?\n\nIn summary, the woman's actions led to the current predicament. She delayed medical care, lied about her past, and changed her mind. The guy is expressing his disapproval, which might be valid given their circumstances, but he's not forcing her. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014maybe being unsupportive or critical\u2014could contribute to the problem. But based on the information given, it seems the woman is more at fault for her actions, so the guy isn't necessarily in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any ethical aspect where he's wrong for pressuring her to abort. However, since he's stating his own stance and not forcing her, maybe he's not in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
