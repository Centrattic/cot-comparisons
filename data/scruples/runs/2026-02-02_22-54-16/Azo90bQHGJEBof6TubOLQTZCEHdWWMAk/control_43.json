Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote that Reddit post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy is 22, his GF is 23, they live in Europe, specifically Denmark. They started dating in August. She told him she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. She also said if she ever got pregnant, she'd just abort. Now she is pregnant, and he's telling her to get an abortion. \n\nThe problem is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, which is what she's at now. She delayed going to the doctor, which means she's having a surgical abortion now instead of chemical. The guy is concerned about their readiness for a child: he works a lot, she's on welfare, has mental health issues, and they can't handle the stress. She used vulgar language about killing the baby, and she had a past pregnancy she didn't mention. She claimed she couldn't get pregnant, but maybe that's not true. \n\nHe's upset she didn't reschedule the abortion, leading to the surgical one. He feels she misused his trust by hiding her past pregnancy and not being honest about her fertility. He's not in the wrong for wanting to abort because they're not ready, but is he in the wrong for pressuring her? \n\nIn terms of ethics, the woman has the right to make decisions about her body. Even if they're not ready, the decision to abort should be hers. The guy is influencing her decision, which might be controlling. Also, she was initially in favor of abortion but became hesitant. He's pressuring her, and that could be problematic. \n\nHe's not wrong for having concerns, but pressuring her into an abortion, especially when she's showing hesitation, might be wrong. Also, respecting her autonomy is key. Even if he disagrees with her actions, he can't force her to make a decision that she's not comfortable with. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's pressuring her to abort against her wishes, especially when she went to the doctor and didn't get the abortion done, indicating she might be changing her mind. Also, the way he frames it as her being in the wrong for delaying might be his judgment, not hers. He's not considering her autonomy. So, B or A?\n\nWait, but in the scenario, he's the one who told her to get an abortion. She went to the doctor but didn't proceed right away. He's upset that she didn't act faster. But if she's now hesitant, he's pressuring her. Even if he has valid reasons, he shouldn't be controlling her decision. So yes, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
