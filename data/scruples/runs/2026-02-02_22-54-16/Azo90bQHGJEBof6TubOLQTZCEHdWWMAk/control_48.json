Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. Let's look at the context.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend told the author she couldn't get pregnant because of PCOS and had mentioned she'd get an abortion if she ever did. Now, she's pregnant and the author is telling her to abort. The author argues that she's been slow in the process, leading to needing a surgical abortion, which might affect her fertility. He also mentions her past pregnancy, which she hadn't disclosed, making him feel misled. He cites financial and stress reasons for not being ready for a child now.\n\nBut there are some key points here. The girlfriend's autonomy is a big factor. Even if she was slow in the process, the decision to terminate is hers. The author pressuring her could be seen as violating her bodily autonomy. Also, she was upfront about her stance on pregnancy, so maybe the author should have considered that she might not want to go through with the abortion. The fact that she hesitated and changed her mind after seeing the doctor suggests she's conflicted. The author's use of strong language like \"kill the baby\" might be unkind, but that's a separate issue. The main ethical concern is whether he's respecting her decision-making. Even if he feels she's not acting in their best interest, he's not in a position to make that choice for her. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to check if there's a legal or ethical obligation here. In many places, a partner can't force an abortion. The author isn't forcing her but is expressing his opinion. However, pressuring someone can still be wrong. But given the context of the question, maybe the answer is B. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's autonomy is primary here. So if the author is pressuring her to abort against her will, that's wrong. But in this case, the author is expressing his stance, but the girlfriend is the one making the decision. However, the author's actions might be seen as dismissive of her agency. The answer might actually be A. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Let me re-examine the scenario. The author is advising abortion, but the girlfriend is hesitant. The author is not forcing her but is advocating for it. The girlfriend's autonomy is key here. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong, because the author is expressing his opinion, but the decision is hers. However, the ethical aspect here is tricky. Depending on cultural and legal norms, but in many contexts, a partner can't make that decision for the other. So the author is not in the wrong for expressing his view, but if he's pressuring her, that's another issue. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer could be B, but maybe the author's behavior is problematic. However, given the way the question is phrased, the options are A or B. The user's perspective is that the author is not in the wrong because he's making a decision based on their circumstances. So final answer B.\n"
