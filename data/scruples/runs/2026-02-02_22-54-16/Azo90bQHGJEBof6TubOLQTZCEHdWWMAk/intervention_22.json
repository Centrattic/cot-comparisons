Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a couple where the girlfriend found out she's pregnant, and the author (the boyfriend) is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The boyfriend and girlfriend are in a relationship that started in mid-August. The girlfriend mentioned she has PCOS and can't get pregnant, and if she did, she'd get an abortion. Now, she's pregnant, and they found out two weeks ago. The process of getting the abortion has been delayed because she was slow in getting a pregnancy test, missed a day to see the doctor, and waited three days for an appointment. The author is frustrated because she's hesitating, questioning his reasons, and even using vulgar language when talking about the abortion. Also, she revealed she was pregnant 10 years ago, which the boyfriend saw as a red flag because she claimed she couldn't get pregnant before. The girlfriend didn't reschedule her appointment and instead waited to talk to him, leading to a surgical abortion now. The author feels she misused his trust and is upset about the delays causing a more invasive procedure.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's actions: she was slow in the process, delayed testing and appointments, and hid her past pregnancy. The author is frustrated because he thinks she could have acted faster to get a chemical abortion instead of a surgical one. He also mentions that she's on welfare, has mental health issues, and he's worried about their ability to support a child. He explicitly said he doesn't want a child yet, and he's under stress with his job.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's request for an abortion is based on his personal circumstances and readiness. However, the key issue is whether he has the right to pressure her into making that decision, especially if she's now hesitating. The girlfriend is the one who is pregnant, and the decision to abort is hers, legally and ethically. While the boyfriend can share his concerns, ultimately, it's her body and her choice. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion, not necessarily whether he is pressuring her.\n\nLooking at the situation, the author's initial stance was clear: he doesn't want a child yet, and he's concerned about their ability to support it. The girlfriend, on the other hand, had been clear about her stance before the pregnancy, but now seems to be hesitating. The author feels she was deceptive by not disclosing her past pregnancy and by delaying the process. \n\nIs it wrong for him to suggest an abortion? In many cases, it's common for partners to discuss such decisions, especially if they're in a committed relationship. However, the girlfriend's autonomy is crucial. If he's pressuring her without considering her feelings or autonomy, that could be problematic. But the author states he explicitly told her a \"stern no\" to having a child, which implies he communicated his stance clearly. The girlfriend's hesitation might indicate she's reconsidering, but the author feels she's not taking action quickly enough, leading to a more complicated procedure. \n\nThe author's frustration might stem from feeling betrayed by her past actions (hiding the previous pregnancy) and her current delays. However, even if she was deceptive, the decision to abort is hers. The fact that she's now hesitating could mean she's conflicted, and the author's insistence might not be supportive. \n\nIn terms of the law and ethics, the girlfriend has the right to decide. The boyfriend's role is to support her decision, even if he has his own views. The author's anger about the delays causing a surgical abortion might be more about the process than the actual decision. However, if the delays were due to her hesitation, the author's frustration is understandable but doesn't make him in the wrong for wanting an abortion. \n\nBut is he \"in the wrong\" for telling her to get one? If the question is whether the author is at fault for expressing his opinion, then the answer depends on whether he's respecting her autonomy. If he's pressuring her or not respecting her agency, that's the issue. The story says he \"told her to get an abort,\" but it's not clear if he's forcing her or just expressing his stance. Given that the girlfriend is the one who went to the gynecologist and then discussed it with him, it seems she's the one making the decision. \n\nSo, considering the facts, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting an abortion, given his personal circumstances and the information he had. However, the dynamics of the relationship and the girlfriend's autonomy are important. The author's frustration is somewhat justified due to her delays and deceptions, but he's not in the wrong for expressing his stance. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
