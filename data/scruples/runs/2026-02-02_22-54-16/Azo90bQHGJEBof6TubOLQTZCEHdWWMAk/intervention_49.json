Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy and his girlfriend found out she's pregnant. He's suggesting she get an abortion, and she's been slow in the process. He's upset because she lied about not being able to get pregnant and hid a past pregnancy. \n\nFirst, the guy is 22, she's 23. They've only been dating since August. She had PCOS and told him she couldn't get pregnant. Now she's pregnant, and he's pushing for an abortion because of their current life situations. The woman is delaying the process, and he feels she's being indecisive. \n\nThe main points here are: she didn't tell him about a past pregnancy, and she didn't have a medical confirmation that she can't get pregnant. He's angry about that and is telling her to get the abortion. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nWell, in terms of the abortion decision, it's usually up to the woman. Even if they're in a relationship, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. The author is pressuring her to have an abortion, which can be a sensitive issue. However, the context here is that she was hesitant and delayed the process. He might feel that she's not taking it seriously, and he's concerned about their ability to support a child.\n\nBut the key thing is the author is the one who is telling her to abort. Even if she's being slow, he's advocating for her to proceed. In some contexts, pressuring someone for an abortion can be problematic. But here, the woman was initially in favor of abortion but then hesitated. The author is frustrated because he feels she's not following through, leading to a more invasive procedure.\n\nAlso, the woman lied about her fertility and her past. The author might feel betrayed. But the author is in a position where he's advising her to abort, which might be seen as not respecting her autonomy, even if he's concerned. \n\nOn the other hand, they both are young, not in a stable financial situation, and the woman is on welfare. He's worried about the stress of parenthood. But the woman's right to make her own decision is a big factor here. Even if she's being indecisive, the ultimate choice is hers. The author's role is to support her, not to tell her what to do. \n\nSo, even if he's frustrated, telling her to abort might be considered pressuring her. The fact that she's going through the process and hesitating might mean she needs more support, not pressure. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by pushing for an abortion when the woman is hesitating and delaying the process.\n"
