Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an opinion on whether they did the right thing by telling their girlfriend to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're in a relationship, both young, in Europe (specifically Denmark). The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But now she's pregnant. She initially said if that ever happened, she'd get an abortion without a problem. However, when it actually happened, she was hesitant and delayed in seeking medical help. The author is concerned about their ability to support a child, citing work stress and her welfare status and mental health. The girlfriend uses harsh language about abortion, like \"kill the baby,\" and the author is upset because she didn't get a timely appointment, leading to a surgical abortion. Plus, she had a previous pregnancy ten years ago, which she didn't disclose, and the author feels she misrepresented her fertility issues.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author wanted an abortion, the girlfriend delayed, leading to a more invasive procedure, and she hid her past pregnancy. The author is frustrated and doesn't feel bad about her needing a surgical abortion because of her delays. The question is whether the author is at fault for pressuring her to get the abortion.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the wrongness would depend on several factors. The couple's agreement on not having children, the girlfriend's initial stance, her delays, and the hidden pregnancy. The author might be in the wrong if the pressure was undue or if there was a lack of communication. But the girlfriend also didn't follow through on her earlier statements and delayed the process unnecessarily, which might shift responsibility.\n\nIn many cultures and legal contexts, a person has the right to decide on their own medical procedures, including abortion. However, when it's a shared decision between partners, both need to communicate openly and respect each other's boundaries. The author made their stance clear, and the girlfriend's delays led to a different procedure than initially possible. The fact that she had a previous pregnancy without prior mention adds to the complexity, as it might have been a point of trust.\n\nBut the key issue is the author's right to express their opinion. If the girlfriend had the right to make the decision regardless, then the author's insistence could be seen as overstepping. However, since they were in a relationship and had discussed this before, the author might believe they have a right to be involved. The delay and her not acting on her own initial decision could be seen as her not following through, which the author is now addressing.\n\nIn Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, so the procedure is still available. The girlfriend's hesitation and delay caused the situation to reach the surgical stage. The author is pointing out that her actions led to a worse outcome. The use of vulgar language by the girlfriend might also contribute to the author's frustration.\n\nThe author's argument is that they were honest about not wanting a child right now, she didn't get a timely abortion, and now they feel let down because she didn't act on her own decision. The girlfriend's hidden pregnancy history and changing stance might be the bigger issue. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author pressured her into an abortion without respecting her autonomy, that could be problematic. But the girlfriend had already indicated she wouldn't consider the pregnancy, and now she's hesitating. The author is enforcing their pre-discussed boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be no, the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their stance, and the girlfriend didn't follow through as she had previously stated. Her delays and hidden information are the key issues here.\n"
