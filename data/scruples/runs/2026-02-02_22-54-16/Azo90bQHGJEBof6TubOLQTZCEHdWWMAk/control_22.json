Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23, they're in Europe, specifically Denmark. They started dating in August. The GF told him she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. She also said if she ever got pregnant, she'd just get an abortion.\n\nNow, they found out she's pregnant two weeks ago. She went to the gynecologist and was told she's 8 weeks along. In Denmark, the abortion method depends on the gestation period: chemical before 8 weeks, surgical between 8-12 weeks. She was slow in the process\u2014forgot to buy a test, missed a doctor's appointment, and delayed getting another. The guy feels she's been hesitant about the abortion and even questioned his reasons. He mentions his inability to handle the stress, financial issues, etc. She uses vulgar language about killing the baby. She also told him she had a pregnancy 10 years ago, which raises a red flag because she claimed PCOS started after that, but no doctor confirmed infertility. She didn't reschedule the abortion after being told she could delay, leading to needing a surgical procedure. The guy feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and delaying the process. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the author is in the wrong for suggesting the abortion. But wait, he's not suggesting it; he explicitly said \"no\" to the pregnancy. Wait, the title says he's asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. Wait, the actual situation is that he's against the pregnancy, but she's hesitating. Wait, the key points are: he's against having a child now, she's the one who's supposed to decide on the abortion, but she delayed, leading to a surgical procedure. He's upset because she lied about her fertility history and delayed the process.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is primarily the woman's right. Even if the partner is involved, the final decision rests with the woman. The man can express his opinion, but he can't force her to make a decision. However, in this case, he's not the one deciding; she's the one who's supposed to go through with the abortion. But she delayed, leading to needing a surgical procedure. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not being supportive or for not taking responsibility.\n\nBut the author is the one who is against having a child and has stated his reasons (work, financial, stress). The girlfriend is the one who is supposed to decide, but she was slow in the process, which now requires a surgical abortion. He's upset because she delayed, which he thinks is her fault. He's also pointing out her dishonesty about her fertility history.\n\nSo, legally and ethically, the woman has the right to make decisions about her reproductive health. However, the man's role here is more about his own stance on not being ready for parenthood. If he's not the one making the decision, he isn't the one in the wrong for not wanting to have a child. However, if he's pressuring her to have an abortion, but in the scenario, it seems like he's against the pregnancy and she's the one who's hesitating. The main issue is her delay and dishonesty, not his initial opposition.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. He is expressing his own stance that he's not ready for parenthood, which is his right. However, if he's pressuring her to have an abortion, but since she's the one who has to make the decision, he's not the one who's wrong. The woman's actions (delaying, not being honest) are her own responsibility. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any aspect where his behavior is problematic. For example, using her mental health issues or financial status against her? Or if he's being dismissive of her feelings. The text says she uses vulgar language, which might be his way of processing, but the main point is his stance on not being ready. Since he's not forcing her to do anything but expressing his position, and he's not the one making the decision, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
