Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told his girlfriend to get an abortion when she found out she was pregnant. The girlfriend has a history of PCOS, which she claims makes her infertile, and she said she would get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. But now she's pregnant, and the author is advising her to abort, but she's being slow in the process, leading to needing a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. There are some red flags, like her past pregnancy and not disclosing that, plus her mental health and financial situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is suggesting an abortion, which is a personal decision. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, so that's within the law. But is the author in the wrong for pressuring her? Well, the girlfriend had already said she would get an abortion if pregnant, so the author's suggestion aligns with her previous statements. However, now she's hesitating, which complicates things. \n\nThe author feels she's being irresponsible by delaying the process, leading to a more invasive procedure. But she's also in a vulnerable position: on welfare, mental health issues, and financial dependence on the author. The author helps her financially but wants her to work toward independence. That's a valid concern. \n\nThe girlfriend's use of vulgar language about the abortion and her hidden past pregnancy are red flags. The author is right to feel betrayed since she didn't disclose her previous pregnancy, which contradicts her claim about PCOS preventing pregnancy. Her hesitation now might be due to conflicting emotions, not just convenience. \n\nBut is the author wrong for suggesting the abortion? Since she agreed to it initially, but now is changing her mind, the author is supporting her original decision. However, the author is making the decision for her, which could be an issue of autonomy. He should respect her choice, even if he disagrees. But given her past statements and the circumstances, maybe his support is based on mutual understanding. \n\nThe key points: Did the author have the right to insist on the abortion? Since it's her body, he shouldn't force her, but he can express his opinion. However, he's not forcing her; he's advising her. The problem is more about her not being honest and delaying the process. The author's frustration is understandable. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the author isn't forcing her to abort, he's supporting her previous stance. Her actions are the ones causing delays and hidden info. The author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
