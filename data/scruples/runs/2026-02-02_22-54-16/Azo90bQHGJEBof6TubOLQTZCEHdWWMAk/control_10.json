Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for a judgment on whether the person who wrote this situation is at fault.\n\nFirst, the main issue is that the author told his girlfriend to get an abortion. They're in a relationship that started in August, and the girlfriend mentioned she can't get pregnant because of PCOS. But later, she ended up pregnant. She delayed the abortion process, and now the author is upset because she didn't act faster, leading to a surgical abortion. He's also concerned about her past pregnancy she didn't mention and her current situation with welfare and mental health issues. \n\nHmm, so the author is questioning whether he's at fault for advising an abortion. Let's break down the key points. \n\nThe author says he never wanted a kid yet and explicitly said no. The girlfriend, on the other hand, claims she can't get pregnant but later reveals she was pregnant before. She delayed the process, which led to the need for a surgical abortion. She uses vulgar language about the baby, which the author finds offensive. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint in Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. She's at 8 weeks now, so it's still within the timeframe. But because she delayed, it's surgical instead of chemical. The author is upset she didn't act faster, making the procedure more complicated. \n\nNow, the author's main argument is that he's not wrong for advising the abortion because he's not ready for a child, and the girlfriend's delays caused complications. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to abort. \n\nIn many relationships, the decision about pregnancy is a mutual one. However, in some cultures or contexts, one partner might have more influence. But in general, the woman has the final say in medical decisions, especially regarding her own body. The author's role here is complex because he's trying to influence her decision, but ultimately, the choice is hers. \n\nThe girlfriend delayed the process, which the author sees as her fault. But maybe she had her own reasons for delaying, like emotional conflict or uncertainty. The author seems to be placing blame on her for not acting sooner, but perhaps he should have been more supportive. \n\nAlso, the fact that she used vulgar language about the baby and the author is upset about that might indicate some emotional tension. The author is concerned about future children and her ability to support a child now. But he's also providing financial support, which might complicate things. \n\nLegally, the author isn't the one who can make the decision about the abortion. The girlfriend has the right to choose. So, is he wrong for advising her to abort? It depends on the dynamics of their relationship. If they had discussed their future plans and he had concerns, he should have communicated them earlier. However, the decision to have an abortion is ultimately hers, and pressuring her is not appropriate. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because he's pressuring her to make a decision that affects her body and health. Even if they had prior discussions about not wanting children, the responsibility for the decision lies with the pregnant person. The author's anger towards her delays and the surgical outcome might reflect his own frustration rather than a valid reason for her to proceed with the abortion. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's history of being pregnant before and her PCOS diagnosis might be factors she's not fully disclosing. But the author's main fault could be in not supporting her through this process and instead focusing on her delays, which could be due to her own mental health struggles. \n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns about his readiness for parenthood and their current situations, he's not the one making the medical decision. Pressuring her to abort, especially after delays that might be due to her own circumstances, could be seen as him being in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and the emotional complexity she's facing.\n"
