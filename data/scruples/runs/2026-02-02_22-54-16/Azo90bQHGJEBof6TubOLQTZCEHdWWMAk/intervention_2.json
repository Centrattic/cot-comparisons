Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant and the author is suggesting she get an abortion. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the story. The couple is in Europe, specifically Denmark, where the law allows abortion up to 12 weeks. The girlfriend had mentioned she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS, but it turns out she was pregnant before. The author is against having a child now due to their young age, financial issues, and the girlfriend's mental health. The girlfriend delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical one, which carries the risk of infertility. The author feels she lied about her fertility and hid her past pregnancy.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for advising the abortion. In many places, including Denmark, both partners can have a say in reproductive decisions, but the final decision usually rests with the woman. The author is expressing his concerns about being a parent, which is valid. However, pressuring someone to have an abortion, even if the couple is not ready, can be seen as wrong, especially if the woman is hesitant. The girlfriend's hesitation and the author's insistence might create a conflict in their relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014delaying the process, using vulgar language about abortion, and hiding her past pregnancy\u2014could indicate she's not being fully transparent. But the author's right to express his opinion and his concerns about their future together are also important. The key is whether the author is forcing the decision on her or supporting her choice. Since the girlfriend ultimately decides not to proceed with the abortion and is consulting the author, it's a complex ethical dilemma. However, in many ethical frameworks, the woman has the autonomy to make the decision, and the partner's role is to support her choice rather than dictate it. The author's insistence might be seen as overstepping if it's not mutual. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but there are nuances."
