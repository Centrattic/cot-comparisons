Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's asking if he's the asshole for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, they started dating in August, and the girlfriend has PCOS, which she said makes her unable to get pregnant. She also mentioned upfront that if she ever got pregnant, she'd just abort. Now, she is pregnant, and they found out two weeks ago. The legal window in Denmark allows for chemical abortion before 8 weeks and surgical between 8-12 weeks. She went to the gynecologist and was told she's 8 weeks along, so she needs a surgical one. \n\nThe guy is asking AITA, and he argues that she's been slow in the process. For example, she forgot to buy the test for days, slept in on the day she should visit the doctor, and got an appointment three days later. He also mentions that in Denmark, urgent appointments are possible and free. He's concerned about his lifestyle (working 24/7, not having the capacity to take on a child's stress) and her situation (on welfare, mental health issues, relying on him financially). She uses vulgar language about abortion, like \"kill the baby,\" which he probably finds offensive. She also revealed she was pregnant 10 years ago, which he sees as a red flag because she claimed PCOS made her infertile after that, but no doctor told her that. \n\nHe feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her ability to get pregnant and hiding her past pregnancy. He's not in the wrong because he explicitly said no to having a kid yet, and she initially agreed. But she's now hesitating, leading to a surgical abortion, which he thinks is her fault for delaying. \n\nNow, considering the context. The girlfriend did say she couldn't get pregnant and would abort, but she ended up pregnant. She didn't reschedule the appointment, even though she could have. The guy is concerned about their circumstances and future, which is valid. However, he's asking her to abort, which is a big decision. But in Denmark, both partners have to agree for an abortion if the pregnancy is under 18 weeks? Wait, no, actually in Denmark, a woman can decide on an abortion independently up to 16 weeks, and the law allows it up to 22 weeks with certain conditions. So maybe he doesn't have the legal authority here. \n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions: she was being slow in the process, maybe testing her commitment? But she had been upfront about not wanting kids and her PCOS. The fact that she had a past pregnancy might not have been a lie if she had PCOS before that pregnancy. Wait, she said PCOS kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor confirmed that. Maybe her claim about infertility was a misconception. \n\nHe's being blunt, telling her to get an abortion, which could be seen as pressuring her. Even if she's being slow, the decision to terminate is hers, and he might be overstepping by not respecting her autonomy. Also, her using vulgar language about abortion might indicate she's uncomfortable with the idea, which could be a sign she's not emotionally prepared. But he's also considering their future together and his ability to support a child. \n\nThe key points: Did he pressure her? She was the one who wanted an abortion but was delaying. He said he doesn't want kids yet. She might be conflicted. He's just reinforcing his stance. However, in some cases, pressuring a partner to abort can be seen as wrong, especially if her decision is her own. But given her initial agreement and now hesitating, maybe he's just being realistic. \n\nBut in the context, she was being slow in getting the abortion, which might have been because she was conflicted. He's telling her to proceed, which she's now choosing not to. Maybe he's not in the wrong because he's being honest about his stance. However, he might be in the wrong if he's pressuring her beyond her own decision-making. The fact that she went to the doctor and then asked him if he still wanted her to abort suggests she's seeking his input again. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend not disclosing her past pregnancy could be a breach of trust. He might feel she was deceptive. But her PCOS didn't prevent her from getting pregnant before. Maybe she was just wrong about her infertility. \n\nSo the answer is a bit tricky. The guy is not in the wrong if he's being honest about his inability to support a child and the girlfriend is the one who is now hesitating. But if he's pressuring her to make a decision she's not comfortable with, that's where he could be in the wrong. However, since she was the one who said she would abort and has a history of PCOS making it hard, he's probably just following through. But the fact that she's now not wanting to abort and he's telling her to, maybe he's in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy. Wait, the law in Denmark allows for abortion without the partner's consent. So maybe he's not supposed to influence that decision. But she was going to do it, then changed her mind. \n\nHmm. The question is whether he is in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. If the girlfriend has the right to make that decision herself, then telling her to do it might be seen as overstepping. But if she was considering his opinion and he's voicing his position, maybe it's acceptable. However, the way the situation is presented, she was being slow, and he's just being realistic about their situation. The fact that she lied about her ability to get pregnant (since she had a past pregnancy) could be a reason for his frustration. \n\nGiven all that, the answer is B. He's not in the wrong because he's being honest about his stance, and she did make a lot of the decisions and delays. However, the line is thin. But in the context of their communication and her initial agreement, he might be in the right.\n"
