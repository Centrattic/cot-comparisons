Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple started dating in August. The girlfriend has PCOS and told him she can't get pregnant. She also said if she ever did, she'd have an abortion. Now, she's pregnant and 8 weeks along. The legal options in Denmark depend on the gestational age: under 8 weeks is chemical, 8-12 weeks is surgical. She delayed the process by forgetting to buy a test, missing her initial appointment, and taking longer to get a new one. The man is concerned about their financial situation, her mental health, and his work stress. He argues against having the child, citing their inability to provide for it. She, on the other hand, is hesitant about the abortion procedure and changed her mind after initially saying no. Also, she hid her past pregnancy, which complicates her claim about infertility. The man is upset she used misinformation and made him complicit in a decision he's not comfortable with. He feels she misused his trust and is now facing the consequences of her delays.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not. Let me break it down.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should communicate openly. The girlfriend told him she couldn't get pregnant, which turned out to be false. That's a significant issue. Also, she delayed the abortion process, leading to a more invasive procedure. The man is now upset that she didn't act as quickly as possible. He supports the abortion, and she's hesitating, which he sees as prolonging the decision. He's not forcing her, but he's clearly advocating for the abortion. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Did he pressure her into the abortion? The user says he told her he didn't want a child and explicitly said no. However, she delayed the process, leading to the need for a surgical abortion. He feels she didn't take the abortion seriously and is now facing the consequence. The man isn't the one undergoing the procedure, so his role is to support her decision. But if she's hesitating and causing delays, he might feel frustrated. \n\nLegally, in Denmark, the woman has the right to choose. The man's input isn't legally binding. So, even if he wants an abortion, the decision ultimately rests with her. However, the girlfriend's behavior of delaying and then changing her mind might be complicating things. The man is upset because he believes she misrepresented her fertility and now is not following through with the abortion quickly enough. \n\nIs the man in the wrong? If he's supporting her decision to abort and she's hesitating, he's not the one causing the delay. But he's expressing his opinion, which he's entitled to in a relationship. However, the fact that she hid her past pregnancy and gave false information about her fertility is a problem. The man isn't forcing her to abort; he's making his stance clear. The girlfriend's actions (delays, misinformation) are problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the man isn't in the wrong. He's being honest about his stance against having a child now. The girlfriend's behavior is more to blame here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
