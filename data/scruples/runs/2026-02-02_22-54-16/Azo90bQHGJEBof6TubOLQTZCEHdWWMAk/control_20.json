Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who asked the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant and they're discussing abortion. The author, who's 22, is questioning if he was right to tell her to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant. They were told she was 8 weeks pregnant. The author is concerned about their financial stability and future readiness for a child. The girlfriend delayed the process, leading to a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. She also mentioned a past pregnancy and used vulgar language about abortion.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual decision-making. The author didn't want the child and made that clear. However, pressuring someone to get an abortion can be a red flag. The girlfriend's actions, like delaying the process and hiding her past pregnancy, show poor communication and possible manipulation. But the author's role in telling her to abort might be problematic because the decision should be mutual. Even if the girlfriend made mistakes, the author shouldn't unilaterally decide for her. \n\nAlso, the author's reasons (not being ready, work stress) are valid, but they shouldn't overrule her autonomy. The girlfriend's responsibility to be honest is important, but the author's decision to push for abortion might infringe on her rights. In many places, both partners have a say, but ultimately, the decision is the woman's. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing his stance, but pressuring her could be. However, considering the girlfriend's actions and lack of commitment to moving forward, the author's frustration is understandable. It's a complex situation where both parties have some responsibility.\n"
