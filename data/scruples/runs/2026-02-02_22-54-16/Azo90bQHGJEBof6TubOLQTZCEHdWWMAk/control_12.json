Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who asked the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the person (22) is the boyfriend of their girlfriend (23), and she got pregnant. He told her to get an abortion. She had PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant, but now he finds out she was pregnant before 10 years ago and maybe the PCOS diagnosis wasn't confirmed. She delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical one instead of a chemical one. He's upset because she didn't reschedule, used vulgar language about killing the baby, and hid her previous pregnancy. He's arguing she misused his trust and that he's not in the wrong for suggesting the abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context in Denmark. Abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, and at 8 weeks, it's surgical. The girlfriend delayed, so she went past the 8-week mark. The boyfriend is 22, which is young, and they've only been dating since August. The girlfriend is on welfare, has mental health issues, and relies on him financially. He's working a lot and can't take on more stress. She's been hesitant about the abortion process, leading to delays.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The boyfriend is making a decision about her body. Even though they're in a relationship, she has the right to her own medical decisions. He's pressuring her to abort, which might be controlling. Also, she delayed the process, which he's critical of, but maybe he's not considering her mental state or the reasons for her delays. She's using vulgar language, which is concerning, but that's her choice. The fact that she previously had a pregnancy and PCOS might not have been confirmed as infertility, but that's her medical history.\n\nHe's arguing she's in the wrong for hiding her past pregnancy and not being upfront. However, she might not have considered that her previous pregnancy was a red flag for him. The question is whether he's overstepping by telling her what to do. In most cases, the woman has the autonomy to decide about her own pregnancy. The boyfriend's involvement might not be appropriate. He's also making assumptions about her ability to have a child in the future and her financial situation. His stress about not being able to support a child is valid, but it's not his decision to make. The delay in the process leading to a surgical abortion is her choice, and he's blaming her for that, which might be unfair. She might have had personal reasons for the delay, like anxiety or fear.\n\nSo, considering all that, the boyfriend is suggesting an abortion, which is a significant decision. Even if he has concerns about their future, he's not the one who has to carry the pregnancy. The key issue is that he's pressuring her, which is a violation of her autonomy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
