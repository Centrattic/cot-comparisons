Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me start by going through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the couple is in Europe, specifically Denmark, and the legal framework there allows for abortion up to 12 weeks. The girlfriend is 8 weeks pregnant, so a surgical abortion is required. The man, who's 22, and the girlfriend, 23, started dating in August. The girlfriend had mentioned she has PCOS and couldn't get pregnant. She also stated that if she did get pregnant, she would get an abortion. However, when she became pregnant, the process was delayed because she was slow in getting a test, missed her doctor's appointment, and took longer than necessary to get a new one. The man is concerned about their readiness for a child, citing his work stress, her financial situation on welfare, and her mental health. The woman uses vulgar language about killing the baby and later revealed she had been pregnant before, which contradicted her earlier claims about not being able to get pregnant. The man feels she misrepresented her ability to have children and didn't act swiftly enough to terminate the pregnancy, leading to the need for a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one.\n\nThe main question is whether the man is at fault for advocating for the abortion. Let's break down the key points. The woman was upfront about her stance on abortion if pregnant, but she later hesitated, leading to delays. The man is concerned about their circumstances, which seems reasonable. However, the woman's actions\u2014like delaying the appointment and using harsh language\u2014might indicate her own ambivalence or lack of consideration for the man's concerns. The man's decision to encourage the abortion seems to be based on practical reasons, which could be seen as valid given their situation. However, the woman's initial misrepresentation about her fertility and her past pregnancy might have contributed to the man's decision, but does that make him in the wrong?\n\nFrom a legal perspective in Denmark, abortion is legal, so the act of suggesting an abortion isn't illegal. Ethically, the situation is more complex. The woman's delays led to a more complicated procedure, which the man feels she could have avoided. The man's concerns about their readiness for a child are legitimate, especially considering their ages, financial situations, and future plans. The woman's use of vulgar language about the pregnancy might indicate a lack of respect for the man's feelings or the process. However, the man's role in the decision might be influenced by his own stress and responsibilities, which are valid considerations.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of consent and shared decision-making in a relationship. While the woman made the initial decision to pursue an abortion when pregnant, her delays complicated things. The man's insistence on the abortion might be seen as not respecting her autonomy, especially if she's now hesitant. However, the woman's initial stance was clear, and the man's position aligns with her original plan. The woman's hidden past pregnancy and misrepresentation about her fertility could be factors that the man is reacting to, which might affect his trust.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the man's suggestion isn't inherently wrong given their circumstances, but the dynamic of their relationship and communication issues might play a role. The man's primary concern is their ability to handle a child, which is a common issue in such situations. The woman's delays led to a more invasive procedure, which the man feels she could have avoided. However, the woman's hesitation and the man's push for termination might both be responses to the same underlying stress about their readiness for parenthood.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the man's actions seem to be a response to the woman's initial stance and their shared concerns about raising a child. His decision to advise an abortion isn't necessarily wrong from a practical standpoint, but it's important to consider mutual respect and communication in their relationship. The woman's delays and misrepresentation might have contributed to the man's decision, but the core issue is whether suggesting an abortion is wrong, which in this context, given their circumstances, might not be. However, the way the man communicates his stance and the woman's reaction are also important. The user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong, and based on the analysis, I tend to agree. So the answer would be B.\n"
