Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising his girlfriend to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is young, in their 20s, in Europe. The girlfriend has PCOS and claims she can't get pregnant. She told him she'd abort if she ever got pregnant. They found out she's pregnant, and she's been delaying the process by missing appointments and not acting quickly. Now, she's at the point where it's surgical instead of chemical. The author argues against the pregnancy, citing their inability to handle a child financially and emotionally. She then reveals she was pregnant before 10 years ago, which contradicts her previous claims. The author feels she lied about her infertility and hid past pregnancies, leading to his decision to suggest an abortion.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\n1. **Communication and Trust**: The girlfriend provided false information about her fertility and past pregnancy. If she knew she couldn't get pregnant, why was she pregnant now? Also, hiding a past pregnancy might be a breach of trust. The author's frustration here is understandable.\n\n2. **Shared Decision-Making in Abortion**: In many places, abortion is a woman's right, and the decision should be mutual. But the author is suggesting she abort the pregnancy, which she's hesitant about. The girlfriend's use of vulgar language (\"kill the baby\") might be harsh, but her hesitation in proceeding could be her own internal conflict. The author's role in pressuring her for the abortion might be contentious.\n\n3. **Responsibility and Timing**: The girlfriend delayed the process, leading to a more invasive procedure. The author feels she's responsible for that delay. However, if she's hesitant, forcing the decision on her could be problematic. The author's stance could be seen as taking control of her reproductive choices, which is a sensitive area.\n\n4. **Financial and Emotional Factors**: The author cites financial instability and stress. While valid concerns, they might be using them to justify his position without fully respecting her autonomy. The girlfriend is on welfare, and he mentions helping her financially, but that's conditional on her working towards a future.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: The author might be in a position where he's not ready for parenthood, but pushing for an abortion could be seen as prioritizing his own needs over her autonomy. Conversely, she's making decisions that could affect both of their futures without full agreement.\n\n6. **Legal Context in Denmark**: The law allows for abortion up to 12 weeks. The girlfriend's delay meant she had to opt for a surgical procedure, which the author points out. However, her hesitation might stem from her own fears or pressures, not just delay.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he's honest about his stance and her actions led to complications. On the other, he's taking a position that affects her reproductive rights. The key issue is whether advising an abortion, especially when she's hesitant, infringes on her autonomy. The girlfriend's delays and hidden past might justify his frustration, but the decision to abort is hers to make. The author's role in pressuring her could be seen as overstepping, especially if he's not willing to support her choice. \n\nGiven that, the answer might lean towards the author being in a complex situation but not necessarily in the wrong, especially if the girlfriend's actions were deceptive. However, pushing for a decision that she's reluctant about could be problematic. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because of the girlfriend's dishonesty and the author's right to his opinion, but it's a nuanced case.\n"
