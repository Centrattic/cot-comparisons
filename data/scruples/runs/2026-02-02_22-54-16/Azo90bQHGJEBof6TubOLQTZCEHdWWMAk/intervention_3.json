Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation involves a lot of details about their relationship, her medical history, and their communication.\n\nFirst, the guy is 22, she's 23, from Europe, specifically Denmark. They started dating in August. She told him she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. But now she's pregnant, which she had been told was possible because of PCOS but maybe not a certainty. She had also mentioned she would get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. \n\nNow, they found out she's pregnant and she's been delaying the process. She had a chance to get a chemical abortion before 8 weeks but delayed, leading to needing a surgical one. The guy is concerned about future plans, their financial situations, and her mental health. He wants her to abort, but she's hesitating and even questioned his reasons. She also used vulgar language when talking about the abortion. Additionally, she had a past pregnancy around 10 years ago, which she didn't mention, and she didn't have a doctor confirming her infertility from PCOS.\n\nThe guy feels she misrepresented her ability to get pregnant and hid her past pregnancy. He's upset about the delay causing a more invasive procedure. The user thinks the guy isn't in the wrong. \n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In many places, including Denmark, abortion is legal, but the procedures vary. The guy is advising her to have an abortion, which she's now hesitant about. But she had previously said she would get one. Now she's changing her stance, possibly due to her own hesitations. \n\nThe guy's reasoning includes not being ready for a child financially and emotionally, which are common considerations. However, the key points are whether he's in the wrong for pressuring her. In many countries, especially in Europe, women have reproductive rights, and a partner pressuring them to terminate a pregnancy can be seen as overstepping. The woman has the right to make her own decisions about her body and her pregnancy, even if the partner disagrees.\n\nAdditionally, the woman's hesitation and the delay in the process might indicate she's not as sure about the abortion as she initially claimed. The guy's pressure could exacerbate her stress. The fact that she didn't reschedule the appointment and waited to talk to him might be her way of processing the decision, but the guy is frustrated because he feels she's responsible for the delay leading to a more complicated procedure.\n\nAlso, her initial misrepresentation about her fertility history\u2014saying she can't get pregnant when she actually could, and hiding a past pregnancy\u2014could be a factor. But even if she did mislead, does that justify the guy pressuring her to abort? Maybe not. The woman's autonomy is paramount. Even if there were red flags, the decision to have an abortion is hers alone. The guy's role is to support her decision, not dictate it.\n\nMoreover, using vulgar language about the abortion is concerning. It might indicate a lack of respect for the decision and her experience. The guy's frustration is understandable given the circumstances, but ultimately, the choice is hers. Pressuring her could be seen as controlling, regardless of his reasons.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the guy is in the wrong for pressuring her into an abortion, even if he has valid concerns. The woman has the right to make her own reproductive choices, and his insistence might infringe on that right. Therefore, the correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but wait, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Need to double-check.\n\nWait, in Denmark, the abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. The woman had the opportunity to get a chemical abortion before 8 weeks but delayed. The guy's argument is that if she had acted faster, it would be easier. However, the woman's hesitation might be valid. The guy's pressure might not consider her emotional state. Even if he's concerned about future plans, he can't force her decision. So, the answer could be A (Yes) because he's pressuring her, but maybe B (No) if the user's reasoning is correct. But the key point is the woman's autonomy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for pressuring her. So the answer is A.\n"
