Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. They started dating in August, and from the beginning, the girlfriend mentioned she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. She also said if she ever does get pregnant, she'll just get an abortion. Now they found out she's pregnant. The guy wants her to abort it because they're not in a position to have a kid. But the girlfriend is hesitating, taking longer than necessary to get the process done, which delays the abortion from being chemical to surgical. She also lied about not being pregnant before and her ability to conceive.\n\nThe guy is frustrated because he feels she's misusing his trust by not being honest. He's concerned about their financial situations, his work, and her mental health. He's not ready for a child and communicated that clearly. The girlfriend's actions seem to contradict her initial statements, showing inconsistency. \n\nLegally in Denmark, abortion is available up to 12 weeks, but the earlier the process, the better. She delayed, which caused her to go for surgery. The guy is upset that she didn't act faster, leading to a more complicated procedure. Her using vulgar language about the abortion and hiding her past pregnancy are also red flags for him.\n\nNow, considering the AITA angle. The guy isn't the one who caused the pregnancy. The girlfriend made a mistake in her actions or maybe in the timing. He's being honest about his inability to support a child and is advising her to abort, which is a personal decision. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nBut in this case, the guy is making a decision based on his current life circumstances. He's not forcing her, but he's expressing his position. The girlfriend's actions (delaying, lying) are her own choices. So, the guy isn't in the wrong here. He's being honest about his stance, which he made clear from the start. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue, not his response to it.\n"
