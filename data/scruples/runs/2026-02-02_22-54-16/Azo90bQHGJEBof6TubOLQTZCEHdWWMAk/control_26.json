Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author pressuring their girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The girlfriend has PCOS and told him she couldn't get pregnant. She also said she'd get an abortion if she ever did. They found out she's pregnant, 8 weeks along, and there's a timeline issue because she delayed getting an appointment, leading to needing a surgical abortion instead of a medical one. The author is concerned about the stress and financial aspects, and now she's hesitating, leading him to feel she's misused his trust.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend had told him about her past pregnancy and her condition, but maybe she didn't get a doctor's confirmation that she can't get pregnant. The author is pressuring her to abort, but she's now hesitating. The author is upset she delayed, leading to a more complicated procedure. \n\nIn terms of ethics, pregnancy decisions are personal and the woman has the right to make choices about her body. The author is expressing his opinions, but forcing her to make a decision against her will would be wrong. However, the girlfriend's delay might be a factor, but the author is now criticizing her for that. \n\nThe author's question is whether he's at fault for telling her to abort. Since the decision should be hers, if he's pressuring her or not respecting her autonomy, that's problematic. Even if he has valid concerns about their life situations, he can't override her choice. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy and is pressuring her to abort, which is her decision to make. His criticism of her process and decisions invades her right to choose, regardless of his reasons.\n"
