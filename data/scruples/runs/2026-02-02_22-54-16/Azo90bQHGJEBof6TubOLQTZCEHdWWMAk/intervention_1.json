Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend are in a relationship that started in August. She had PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant, but now she's pregnant. She mentioned before that if she got pregnant, she'd just get an abortion. But when she did get pregnant, she was slow in taking action, leading to a surgical abortion now. The author is concerned because he doesn't want a kid right now due to his work, their financial situations, and her mental health. He also found out she was pregnant before, which she didn't tell him.\n\nShe's been using harsh language about the abortion, like calling it killing the baby. The author thinks she's being inconsistent because she said she can't get pregnant, but now she's pregnant and delaying the process. He feels she took advantage of his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and current hesitancy.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know the assistant's opinion. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The author is supporting his partner to get an abortion based on their current life circumstances. He's not forcing her, but encouraging her to do what he thinks is best. However, the situation is complicated by her delays, dishonesty about her medical history, and her own hesitation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is making a decision based on their shared future. But in a relationship, both partners should have autonomy over their bodies. The author isn't forcing her, but he's expressing his opinion. However, the fact that she didn't get tested quickly and delayed the process might be her own responsibility. \n\nThe author also discovers she had a past pregnancy, which she didn't disclose. That could be a breach of trust, but maybe he overreacted. The main issue is whether advising an abortion is wrong. In many contexts, seeking an abortion is a personal choice, and supporting it isn't inherently wrong. However, the way he frames it as being in her best interest and her not being responsible might raise questions about his intentions.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is respecting her autonomy and not forcing her, then he's not necessarily wrong. However, the way he dismisses her hesitation and calls her out for delays could be seen as judgmental. Also, the fact that she's making her own medical decisions, and he's pressuring her to proceed quickly, might be an issue.\n\nIn some cultures or legal systems, the partner's role in reproductive decisions is a hot topic. But in Denmark, it's the woman's choice. The author's influence might be overstepping if he's making her feel guilty or pressuring her. However, he's not forcing her, just advising based on their circumstances.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions might not be in the wrong if he's supporting her decision. But the ethical aspect is complex. However, based on the information, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's acting in their shared interests, even if the approach is flawed.\n"
