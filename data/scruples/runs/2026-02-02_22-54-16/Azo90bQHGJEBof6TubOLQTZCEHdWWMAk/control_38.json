Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant and wants to terminate the pregnancy, but she's been delaying the process. The author is upset because she told him she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS, but now he finds out she was pregnant before and didn't mention it. He's also frustrated with her delays leading to a surgical abortion and her use of vulgar language about the procedure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 22, the girlfriend 23. They've been dating since August. The girlfriend was told she can't get pregnant (PCOS), but now she's pregnant. She delayed testing, missed appointments, and is now considering the surgical option. The author feels she's been dishonest about her fertility history and is upset about the delays. He's also concerned about their readiness for parenthood given their circumstances.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the girlfriend misrepresented her ability to get pregnant (no doctor confirmed infertility) and hid a past pregnancy. He's angry because she's now hesitating about the abortion, leading to a more invasive procedure. He also feels she's not taking the situation seriously, given her welfare status and mental health issues.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is at fault. He asked her to get an abortion, but she's hesitant and delaying. The question is whether he's wrong for pressuring her. In many places, including Denmark, abortion is a legal and personal decision. The girlfriend has the right to make her own medical choices. The author's frustration stems from his belief that they're not ready for a child, but he's not the one carrying the pregnancy. Pressuring her to abort could be seen as controlling, especially if she's making her own decisions based on her circumstances.\n\nHowever, the author's concerns about their ability to support a child are valid. But the decision to terminate is hers. The fact that she delayed the process might be due to her own emotional conflict or other factors. The author's anger at her delays and what he perceives as dishonesty (not confirming infertility and hiding past pregnancy) adds to his frustration.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If she's legally allowed to make the decision and he's pressuring her against her will, that could be controlling. However, the context shows he's not forcing her but expressing his stance. Still, the fact that she initially said she couldn't get pregnant and now he's confronting her about it might be an issue. However, if she was lying about her fertility, that's her responsibility. The author's role is to communicate his stance but not control her decisions.\n\nThe key here is autonomy. The girlfriend has the right to decide about her body, even if her partner disagrees. The author's frustration is understandable, but pressuring her to abort could be seen as wrong, especially if she's conflicted. However, the author might not be the one at fault if he's being honest about his stance and not coercing her. The answer hinges on whether his actions cross into controlling behavior. Given that he's not forcing her but expressing his position, he might not be in the wrong. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014maybe not considering her autonomy and emotional state\u2014could be problematic.\n\nBut in the AITA context, the focus is on whether he's the asshole. If he's not forcing her but expressing his opinion, he might not be. However, if he's pressuring her beyond his right, he could be. Given that she's making her own decisions, and he's stating his position without coercion, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong, but there's nuance.\n"
