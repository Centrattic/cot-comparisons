Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if the person who posted this on Reddit (AITA = Am I the Asshole) is at fault for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is in Europe, Denmark specifically. The girlfriend has PCOS, which the author says makes pregnancy difficult. The GF has been clear from the start that if she does get pregnant, she'll abort. Now they are in a situation where she's pregnant, and the author is advising her to get an abortion. The GF is hesitant, slow in the process, and even went to the gynecologist but didn't proceed. The author points out her delays, her use of vulgar language when talking about abortion, and her hidden past pregnancy. The author feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her fertility and previous pregnancy.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The author is suggesting abortion because they feel unprepared financially and emotionally. The GF is dealing with her own issues (mental health, welfare, etc.) and maybe has mixed feelings. However, the author is pressuring her to make a decision, which might be a problem. The GF's delays might be due to her own anxiety or indecision, which is common in such situations. Also, the author's tone about her not being able to handle a child and her financial situation could be seen as dismissive of her capabilities. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about their future and the potential impact of having a child now. The GF's history of not being honest (past pregnancy, not confirming fertility issues with a doctor) adds to his frustration. But is it his place to make decisions about her body and her reproductive choices? The key issue here is autonomy. Even if the author has valid concerns, the decision to have an abortion is ultimately hers. Pressuring her to make that decision, especially in a relationship, can be seen as violating her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning includes judging her ability to parent based on her current situation and his own stress levels. While those are valid personal concerns, they might not be fair to project onto her. The GF might have different views on her ability to handle motherhood. The author's insistence on an abortion could be seen as controlling, especially if she's not fully on board with the decision.\n\nIn terms of the delays, the author is upset she took longer than necessary, leading to a surgical abortion. But maybe she was dealing with emotional turmoil or other factors. The author's frustration is understandable, but the responsibility for the timing might not be entirely hers. The system's scheduling could be part of the issue. Also, the author's use of \"killing the baby\" language from her might be causing him distress, but that's her choice of words, not his.\n\nThe fact that she withheld her past pregnancy could be a breach of trust, but it's unclear if that's a major factor. The author's main point is about her not being honest about her fertility. However, even if she lied, the decision about the pregnancy is hers. The author's role here is as a partner, but reproductive decisions are personal. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about their readiness for parenthood, pressuring his partner to abort against her hesitation might cross the line. The core issue is the autonomy in decisions about one's own body. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and for making the decision for her. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). Wait, but the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm. Need to recheck.\n\nWait, another angle: in the post, the author says he told her to get an abortion, but she was already planning to do so. However, her delays led to a surgical abortion. The author is upset she didn't act faster, leading to a more invasive procedure. His frustration is about her not acting promptly, and he's not forcing her\u2014it's her decision. But he's expressing that he's not feeling bad about her not getting the abortion quickly. However, the key is whether he's in the wrong for advising her to have the abortion. Since it's her body, he might be overstepping if he's making the decision for her. But he's stating his reasons, which are about their future. But if she's the one who initially didn't proceed because she was hesitant, then his advice might be valid. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. In many contexts, advising someone to have an abortion is a personal choice, but if he's pressuring her when she's hesitant, that could be problematic. The AITA dynamic often looks at if the person is being controlling or dismissive. The author's frustration with her delays and his insistence might come off as controlling. So maybe A (he is in the wrong). Alternatively, if he's just stating his position and she's the one who is indecisive, maybe B (not in the wrong). It's a bit nuanced. But considering the context of her autonomy and the pressure he might be exerting, I think the answer is A.\n"
