Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend gets pregnant, and the guy is suggesting she get an abortion. She ends up not getting the abortion, and the guy is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal context in Denmark. The law allows abortion up to 12 weeks, which is what the user mentioned. She was 8 weeks in when she went to the doctor, but there was a delay in getting the procedure. The guy is upset because she didn't act quickly enough, leading to a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. He's also concerned about her past pregnancy and the fact that she might have hidden it. She's been on welfare and has mental health issues, which he says make her unprepared for a child.\n\nThe guy's main argument is that she didn't follow through on the abortion quickly enough, leading to complications. He also feels she misrepresented her fertility due to PCOS. He's not in favor of having a child now and is frustrated that she didn't proceed with the abortion.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the decision to have an abortion is typically the woman's right. The man doesn't have the legal authority to make that decision for her. Even if they had discussed it, her right to choose is protected. So, if she decided not to go through with the abortion, he can't legally force her. \n\nHe's upset because she didn't act quickly, but the responsibility for the decision ultimately lies with her. Her delays might be due to personal reasons, mental health, or other factors he's not considering. The fact that she's been pregnant before and had PCOS might have contributed to her anxiety or decision-making process.\n\nHe also mentions her using vulgar language about abortion, which could indicate her own internal conflict. She might have been wrestling with the decision, and the delays could be signs of that struggle. His frustration is understandable, but he doesn't have the right to dictate her medical choices.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's decision to question the abortion is based on his own reasons about being unprepared. However, the final decision is hers. If she chose not to proceed, he can't be in the wrong for expressing his opinion, but he's wrong to pressure her or take responsibility for her decision. The key point is that her autonomy in medical decisions is paramount. He's not in the wrong for having his opinion, but he might have overstepped by not respecting her right to make a different choice than he wanted.\n"
