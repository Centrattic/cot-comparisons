Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, the situation: They started dating in August, and the girlfriend had PCOS and believed she couldn't get pregnant. She mentioned she'd get an abortion if she ever did. They found out she was pregnant, but she delayed getting a test and visiting the doctor, leading to needing a surgical abortion. The guy argues against having a child due to their situations\u2014his job stress, her welfare status, mental health, and financial issues. He also points out her past pregnancy and claims of infertility without a doctor's confirmation. She now wants to discuss continuing the pregnancy.\n\nThe author's main points are about responsibility and trust. He feels she misrepresented her fertility and delayed the process, leading to a more complicated procedure. He's concerned about their ability to care for a child now. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally and ethically, decisions about pregnancy involve both partners, but the final decision typically rests with the woman. However, the author is advocating for an abortion based on valid concerns. The girlfriend's delays and hidden past pregnancy might contribute to the situation. The author isn't forcing her but is expressing his stance based on their circumstances. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a decision based on their life situations. However, the complexity arises from her delays and the trust issues. But the core question is about his responsibility in advising an abortion, which he's entitled to do. So, the answer is B.\n"
