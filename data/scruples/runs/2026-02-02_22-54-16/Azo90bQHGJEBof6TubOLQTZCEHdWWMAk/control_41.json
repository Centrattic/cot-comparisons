Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe couple is in Europe, Denmark to be specific. The guy is 22, the girl is 23. They started dating in August. The girl had PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. She always said if she did get pregnant, she'd get an abortion. Now she is pregnant, 8 weeks along. The law in Denmark allows abortion up to 12 weeks, but after 8 weeks it's surgical. \n\nThe girl took time to process, like forgetting to buy a test, sleeping through her initial appointment, and getting a later doctor's appointment. The guy is concerned about their financial situations\u2014she's on welfare, he's stressed with work. She claims having a baby isn't stressful, but he points out parents he knows find it stressful. She uses vulgar language about killing the baby. She also mentions that surgical abortion might affect her fertility. The guy wants to have kids in the future but feels they aren't ready now. The girl then reveals she was pregnant 10 years ago, which she didn't mention before. She told the doctor she wanted to check with the guy before proceeding with the abortion. The guy feels she lied about not being able to get pregnant and hid her past pregnancy. He's upset she delayed the process, making it surgical instead of chemical.\n\nSo, the guy is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nLet me break this down. First, the girl had PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant, but now she is. That's unexpected. She mentioned she would get an abortion if pregnant, but when it happened, she hesitated. She delayed medical appointments, leading to a surgical abortion. The guy is concerned about their ability to support a child, both financially and emotionally. He points out her mental health issues and her reliance on his help. She uses harsh language about the abortion, which might indicate she doesn't take the decision seriously. \n\nHe also found out she was pregnant before, which complicates her claim about PCOS preventing pregnancy. She didn't mention this, so he feels she lied. The guy wants her to get the abortion, and he's frustrated she didn't act faster. The question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to proceed with the abortion.\n\nIn terms of ethics, a person has the right to make decisions about their own body. Even if the guy is concerned about their future, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is typically up to the pregnant individual. The girl's hesitation might indicate she's conflicted, and the guy is pressuring her to make a decision she's not ready for. However, he also points out her delays and maybe her lack of responsibility in handling the situation. But the fact that she's the one carrying the pregnancy means her bodily autonomy is central here. \n\nLegally in Denmark, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks. The girl is at 8 weeks, so she can still choose. The guy's role in pressuring her could be problematic. Even if they were in a relationship, the decision isn't his to make. However, he's sharing his reasons for wanting the abortion, which are valid concerns about their readiness. But the key point is whether he's in the wrong for advocating for her to proceed. If he's pressuring her to make a decision against her will, that's an issue. However, she did ask him if he wanted her to abort, so maybe he's responding to her request for his opinion. \n\nThe girl's behavior\u2014delaying the process, using vulgar language, hiding past pregnancy\u2014might make him feel justified in his stance. But the fact remains that the final decision is hers. If he's respecting her autonomy but expressing his concerns, then maybe he's not wrong. However, telling her she must abort could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's conflicted. The fact that she delayed the process might be due to her own emotional struggle, and his frustration could be misplaced. \n\nIn terms of trust, she may have misled him about her fertility and past pregnancy. That's a valid reason for him to feel hurt. However, his response to that information\u2014telling her what to do about the abortion\u2014could be the issue. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the guy's concerns are valid, but the decision to abort should be hers. Pressuring her might not be his to do. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But if he's supporting her autonomy while expressing his stance, maybe not. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if he's advocating for what he believes is best while respecting her choice. But if he's forcing her hand, then A. The situation is complex because the girl's actions led to the surgical abortion, and the guy's reasons are about their readiness. However, the legal and ethical right to decide the abortion is hers. So, the answer might be B, but I need to check again.\n\nWait, the guy says \"AITA for telling her to get an abort?\" So he's the one saying she should get the abortion. If the girl is the one who needs to make that choice, then telling her to do it could be seen as overstepping. Even if they discussed it, the final decision is hers. So, if he's pressuring her, that's a problem. Therefore, he's in the wrong (A). But maybe the answer is B because the situation is more neutral. Alternatively, the girl's actions (delays, hiding info) might make the guy's frustration understandable. But the core issue is about bodily autonomy. So, the answer is A (he's wrong) because he's not the one who can decide for her. Even if she asked for his opinion, the decision is hers. So, he's not in the wrong for expressing his opinion, but if he's pressuring her, he is wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get the abortion. In many ethical frameworks, the woman has the right to choose. Therefore, the answer is A. Wait, but in the scenario, he's not forcing her, just telling her what he thinks. But if she's the one who has to decide, his input isn't wrong. Maybe the answer is B. This is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIn the context of a relationship, partners should support each other's decisions. If the girl is conflicted and he's helping her make a decision, maybe it's okay. But if he's pressuring her, that's wrong. However, the fact that she asked him if he wanted her to abort suggests she wanted his input. In that case, his response isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer might be B. But the key is that the decision must be hers. If he's respecting her autonomy, then he's not wrong. If he's trying to control the decision, he is. The details show he's expressing his reasons, which he's entitled to do. So, the answer is B.\n"
