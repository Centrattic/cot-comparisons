Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the man telling his girlfriend to get an abortion after she became pregnant. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the couple is in a relationship that started in August. The girlfriend had PCOS and had always said she couldn't get pregnant, and if she did, she'd get an abortion. Now she's pregnant, and the man is pressuring her to abort. The woman delayed in getting tested and the abortion process, which led to needing a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one. She also revealed she was pregnant 10 years ago, which the man sees as a red flag. The man's main arguments are about financial stress, not being ready for a child, and her mental health and welfare status.\n\nThe woman's actions: she didn't get a test immediately, delayed the doctor's appointment, and hesitated in the process. The man feels she misused his trust by not being upfront about her past pregnancy and the PCOS diagnosis. He's not in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend made decisions that led to needing a more complicated abortion. However, she was hesitant and maybe conflicted. The man's pressure to abort could be seen as controlling if she's not in agreement. But the user says the author is not in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the man has the right to express his stance, but forcing her to make a decision might not be right. However, in this case, the girlfriend did agree to the abortion but delayed the process. The man is upset about her delays and lack of transparency. \n\nThe key points are mutual decisions and trust. The man's main issue is her not being truthful about her medical history and her delays. The woman, on the other hand, may have personal reasons for hesitating. The man's support for her financially is mentioned, but he's not comfortable with the idea of parenthood right now. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the girlfriend made her own decision to abort but the man pushed her, that could be an issue. But in this case, she wanted to involve him in the decision. The man's pressure might stem from his own reasons, but if she's conflicted and he's encouraging her, it's not clear if that's wrong. \n\nConsidering the delays and her past, the man may feel justified in his stance. However, pressuring someone into an abortion can be ethically questionable. But since she agreed to it, maybe it's not wrong. The answer hinges on whether his pressure is undue influence. Given the context, the man is not in the wrong because the decision was mutual, and the woman's actions contributed to the situation. So the answer is B.\n"
