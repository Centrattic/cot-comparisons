Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant, and the author is suggesting she get an abortion. But there's a lot of context here.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old guy in Europe, specifically Denmark. The girlfriend is 23. They started dating in August, and the GF has PCOS, which she claimed made her infertile. She also said she would get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. Now they found out she's pregnant. The author is pushing for an abortion, citing their current life situations\u2014she's on welfare, has mental health issues, he's stressed from work, etc. The GF is hesitant, took longer than necessary to get tests done, uses vulgar language about the abortion, and revealed she was pregnant 10 years ago. The author feels she misrepresented her fertility and is now causing unnecessary stress by delaying the process, leading to a more invasive procedure.\n\nNow, considering the legal context in Denmark: abortion up to 12 weeks is allowed. The GF is 8 weeks along, so she's at the threshold for a surgical abortion. If she had acted quicker, maybe she could have had the chemical one. The author feels she's being slow, which he believes is causing her more risk and a harder procedure. The GF's hesitation and delay are key points here.\n\nThe author is asking for validation that he's not the one in the wrong. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for suggesting the abortion. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the decision to have an abortion is the woman's right. The author is trying to influence her decision, which might not be the best approach. However, the GF's own actions (delaying the process, not being honest about her past pregnancy) could affect how this is viewed. \n\nBut ethically and morally, even if someone is pregnant and facing challenges, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal one. The author is pushing his own reasons (his inability to handle parenthood, her financial situation) onto her. The GF's hesitation and delays might be due to her own emotional or mental health struggles, which the author doesn't seem to consider. \n\nThe author's argument that she misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and fertility could be valid, but that doesn't necessarily make him right in pressuring her for an abortion. The fact that she's using vulgar language and is hesitant might indicate her own internal conflict, which he's not respecting. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should have discussed their future plans and whether they want children. The author's stance seems to stem from his current life situation, but he might not be considering her autonomy and her right to make her own decisions. \n\nSo, while the GF's actions are questionable, the author is also in a position where he's pressuring her for an abortion, which is her choice. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy despite her flaws.\n"
