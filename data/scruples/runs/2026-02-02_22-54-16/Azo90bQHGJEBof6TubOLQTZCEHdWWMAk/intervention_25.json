Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend got pregnant, and the guy suggested an abortion. The user initially thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy is 22, the girlfriend 23. They've been dating since August. The GF has PCOS and said she couldn't get pregnant. She also mentioned she'd get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. Now she's pregnant, and she's been delaying the process, leading to a surgical abortion. The author is upset because she didn't act quickly, used vulgar language about the abortion, and had a previous pregnancy she didn't mention. He's against the pregnancy due to their current life situations and feels she's being dishonest.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is making a decision that affects both of them. In many cultures and legal contexts, both partners should have a say in such matters. However, the author might feel that the pregnancy isn't viable given their circumstances. But the GF also has her own autonomy. She delayed the process, which led to a more complicated procedure, and the author is upset about that. Also, she misrepresented her fertility history by not disclosing a past pregnancy. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they aren't ready for a child, citing work and financial issues. That's a valid concern. However, suggesting an abortion can be a sensitive topic. If the GF is hesitant and the author is pressuring her, that could be problematic. But the author mentions she was slow in the process, leading to a surgical abortion. He's not in favor of the pregnancy and wants her to prioritize her health and future. \n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual decision-making. The author might be overstepping if he's dictating her medical decisions, but he's also concerned about their future. The GF's actions, like hiding her past pregnancy and delaying the abortion, might justify his frustration. \n\nIn many cases, reproductive decisions are personal and should be mutual. The author's role is to support and discuss, not to force a decision. However, if the GF is being irresponsible with the process, the author's concerns about the pregnancy being a burden are understandable. The fact that she didn't act quickly might have led to complications, and the author is upset about the potential risks she's taking. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is wrong for suggesting the abortion. If he's not pressuring her but stating his position, it's part of their discussion. However, if he's pressuring her into it, that's a different story. The user says the author is not in the wrong, but I need to weigh the nuances here. The author's actions are based on their current life situations and the GF's delayed response. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong because he's expressing his stance based on their circumstances, and the GF's actions have contributed to the situation. However, it's a complex issue where both parties need to communicate effectively. The answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
