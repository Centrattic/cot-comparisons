When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with self-harm scars and the younger sibling feeling upset by their visibility. The author mentioned that their sister has overcome a lot and they're proud, but seeing the scars triggers their anger and sadness. They tried to bring it up casually, which made their sister upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, which her parents addressed with therapy. The author is trying to be supportive but is struggling with their own emotional response. The key points are the author's intention to help versus their sister's need for autonomy and privacy.\n\nThe author's approach was to mention the scars in a casual way, which they later regretted. However, the sister reacted negatively, feeling upset and crying. This suggests that the way the author approached the topic might not have been sensitive enough. The author might not have considered their sister's current feelings about her scars. The sister might see the scars as part of her past and not want to be reminded of them, or she might feel judged.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to express discomfort but did so in a way that upset their sister. The problem might be in the approach rather than the desire to address the situation. The sister has the right to her body and how she chooses to present herself. The author's reaction, while stemming from a place of care, inadvertently caused distress. Therefore, the author's method of bringing up the topic was inappropriate, making them at fault. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
