When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe sister is four years older, just left university, and is looking for a job. She was bullied at 17, which led to self-harm. Her parents took her to therapy, and it stopped, but she still has noticeable scars. The author is upset seeing the scars because it makes them angry about the bullying. They mentioned this to the sister, who got upset and cried. Now the author is worried they're being selfish and affecting their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's feelings vs. the sister's autonomy. The author isn't telling her to cover up for any reason other than their own emotional reaction. They acknowledge they're not in the right position to tell her what to do. The sister's scars are a part of her history, and she's come a long way. Covering them up is her personal choice, and the author's request might be seen as invalidating her experience or her recovery.\n\nThe author's intention is to avoid distress, but the sister is upset because her scars are a part of her healing journey. She might view the request as a reminder of the trauma or as pressure to hide her past. The author's comment, even if made casually, triggered a strong emotional response. They might be in the wrong because they're imposing their feelings onto the sister's body and choices without considering her perspective fully. The author should have focused on managing their own emotions rather than asking the sister to change her appearance.\n\nAlso, the sister's autonomy is important. Unless there's a medical reason to cover the scars, it's her right to choose. The author's selfishness here lies in not respecting that boundary for their own comfort. The correct answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
