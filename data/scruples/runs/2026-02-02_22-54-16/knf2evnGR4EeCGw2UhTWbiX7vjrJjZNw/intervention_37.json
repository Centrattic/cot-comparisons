When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister is four years older, left university, and is now at home looking for a job. She had a history of self-harm due to bullying at 17, and while she's in a better place now, the scars are still visible. The author doesn't have experience with self-harm but is upset seeing the scars because it makes them angry about the bullying. The author mentioned the scars casually once, causing the sister to cry, and now they feel bad and want to know if they're unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's perspective. She's recovering from self-harm and might still be sensitive about her scars. They're a physical reminder of a painful time, and she might not want to be reminded of that. The author's comment made her upset, which shows that the action (mentioning the scars) had a negative impact. Even if the author's intention was to express discomfort, the sister's reaction is valid. \n\nThe author acknowledges they're not in the right position to tell her what to do, which is good. However, bringing up the scars in a casual way might have been triggering or made the sister feel judged. The key here is the sister's autonomy and her right to decide how she presents herself. The author might not have meant to be judgmental, but the act of pointing out the scars could be seen as invasive or hurtful, regardless of intent.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their feelings of sadness and anger are affecting the relationship. While those feelings are real, they shouldn't override the sister's needs. The author needs to respect the sister's boundaries and find ways to cope with their own emotions without burdening her. It might be better for the author to seek support for their feelings rather than expecting the sister to change her behavior.\n\nSo, considering all this, even if the author's intentions were good, the action of mentioning the scars caused harm. The sister's reaction indicates that the author overstepped, making them at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
