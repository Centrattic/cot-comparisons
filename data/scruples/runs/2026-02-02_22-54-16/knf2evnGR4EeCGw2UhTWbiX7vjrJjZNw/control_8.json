When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm, now lives at home, and the author feels upset seeing them, leading to a conversation where the sister became upset.\n\nFirst, the author acknowledges their sister's history and the sister's progress. They admit they're not the right person to tell her what to do because they haven't experienced self-harm. The author's main issue is that seeing the scars makes them feel sad and angry about the bullying, even though they recognize it's not about them. They tried to mention it casually but it hurt the sister's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The author's intention was to express discomfort, but they approached it in a way that hurt their sister. The sister's reaction shows that the comment was painful, even if the author didn't mean to be critical. The author might not realize how their words could be perceived as judgmental, even if they were just trying to share their feelings. However, the author did apologize and felt bad about it. \n\nIn such cases, it's important to consider that self-harm scars are a sensitive topic. The sister might feel that being asked to cover them implies that her body is a problem or that her past is something to hide. The author's approach might not have been the best, but it's also possible they meant well. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSince the sister got upset and the author's comment affected their relationship, the impact is clear. The author should have considered how their words might be received and perhaps found a different way to express their feelings, maybe focusing on their own emotional response rather than implying the sister should cover up. However, the author's intention wasn't to criticize but to share their feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author's approach hurt the sister's feelings, even if unintentionally, it's more likely that the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with enough sensitivity. The answer is probably A (Yes), because the author's actions, while perhaps well-meaning, caused harm without considering the sister's perspective adequately.\n"
