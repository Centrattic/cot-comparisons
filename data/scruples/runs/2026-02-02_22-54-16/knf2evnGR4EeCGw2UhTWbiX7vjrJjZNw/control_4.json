When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author's sister has self-harm scars from being bullied, and the author feels upset seeing them, which is affecting their relationship. The sister got upset when the author mentioned the scars.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to process their own emotions here. They admit they might be being selfish because the scars are not about them. But why is the author upset? It's because they're angry about the bullying that led to the self-harm. They\u2019re emotional about their sister's past. However, bringing up the scars directly might not be the right approach. The sister is already in a sensitive situation, having recovered from self-harm, and the author's comment caused her distress.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The sister may not want to discuss or cover her scars. The author's intention was to express their feelings, but they didn't consider the sister's current emotional state or her boundaries. Even if it's to show support, the way they approached it was intrusive. The sister's reaction shows that the topic is still sensitive for her.\n\nThe author is not in the right because they didn't handle it in a supportive way. Instead of addressing their own feelings of sadness and anger, they brought up the scars in a way that upset the sister. The right approach would be to talk about their feelings without making the sister feel judged or re-traumatized. They need to respect the sister's autonomy and her journey, maybe seeking professional help or support groups themselves if they're struggling with their emotions.\n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with the necessary sensitivity and respect for their sister's feelings and boundaries.\n"
