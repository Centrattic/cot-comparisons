When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, the situation: the sister has old scars from self-harm due to past bullying. She's doing better now but still has visible scars. The author is upset seeing them because it triggers sadness and anger about the bullying. They mentioned it once, and the sister got upset and cried.\n\nThe author feels they're being selfish but are concerned about their relationship. They're unsure if they're overstepping.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's scars are a part of her history, and she might have come to terms with them. The author, being younger and not having experienced self-harm, might not fully understand the sister's perspective. \n\nSelf-harm scars are sensitive. Even if they're old, they can be a trigger for the person who self-harmed. The sister might feel judged or reminded of painful times. When the author mentioned it, the sister's emotional reaction was immediate, showing that the topic is still sensitive.\n\nThe author's intention was to express discomfort, but how it was done matters. Bringing it up casually might not have been the right approach. The sister might feel that the author is prying or not respecting her boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author is also expressing concern from a place of caring. They mention feeling sad and wanting to support the sister. The key issue is whether the author has the right to ask the sister to cover her scars, especially since they acknowledge they're not the sister's therapist or in a position to tell her what to do.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, the sister has the right to decide how to present her body. The author's request could be seen as an overreach, even if well-intentioned. The sister's reaction indicates that the topic is personal and possibly hurtful. \n\nThe author might be projecting their own feelings of anger and sadness onto the situation, not realizing that the sister might prefer to keep the scars visible as a reminder of her past or as a way to cope. Also, the author's mention of the scars could inadvertently make the sister feel like her past is a burden or a topic of discomfort in her own home.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to communicate their feelings, which is a valid step in maintaining a healthy relationship. The problem might be in how it was communicated rather than the act of communicating itself. The author might not have considered the sister's emotional state when bringing it up.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are good, the way they approached the issue might have been inappropriate, leading to hurt feelings. The sister's right to autonomy over her body and emotional response to her past is important. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's boundaries, even if unintentionally.\n"
