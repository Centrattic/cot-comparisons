When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister having self-harm scars that the author finds upsetting to see, leading them to mention it in a casual way, which upset the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying and has overcome it with therapy. The author mentions that they didn't want to tell her what to do, showing some awareness of her autonomy. However, the author's reaction is rooted in their own emotional response\u2014feeling sad and angry when seeing the scars. The key issue is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the scars in a way that caused distress.\n\nThe author approached the conversation casually, which might have been too abrupt or not sensitive enough. They didn't set up a proper, empathetic discussion to check in with their sister, which is important when dealing with such a sensitive topic. The sister's emotional reaction suggests that the way the author brought it up was hurtful. Even though the author's intention might have been to address their own discomfort, they didn't consider how the sister might feel about her scars being mentioned.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author admitted they aren't in the right position to dictate what the sister should do, which is correct. The sister's scars are part of her past, and she might have chosen to be open about them as a way of coping or showing her progress. The author's focus on their own feelings without fully understanding the sister's perspective could be seen as selfish, as they acknowledge.\n\nHowever, the author's intention wasn't to criticize or judge but rather to express their own emotional struggle. The mistake here is more about the approach and communication style rather than the intention itself. The author didn't frame it as a request for the sister's comfort but as their own emotional need, which might not have been the right way to handle it.\n\nIn terms of whether they're in the wrong, the answer likely hinges on the method of communication. Since the sister was hurt by the casual mention, the author didn't handle it sensitively. They should have had a more thoughtful conversation, considering the sister's feelings first. So while the author's feelings are valid, the way they expressed them was inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their concerns in a way that prioritized the sister's well-being and feelings.\n"
