When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author feeling upset by their sister's visible self-harm scars and mentioning it, which then upset the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider each side. The author's intention was to address their own emotional discomfort. They mentioned the scars in a casual way, not to criticize but because it made them feel sad and angry about the sister's past bullying. However, the sister took it as a request to cover the scars, leading to her emotional response. The author is worried they were selfish and affected the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's scars are a result of trauma and she's made progress in her recovery. Her reaction to the comment might stem from a desire to not be reminded of her pain, or perhaps she feels judged. The author acknowledges not being in the right position to dictate her actions, which is a good point. But the act of mentioning the scars, even if done casually, could be seen as intrusive or triggering for the sister, depending on her current mental state. \n\nThe key factors here are the intent behind the author's words and the impact they had. The author didn't mean to hurt their sister but wanted to manage their own feelings. However, the sister's reaction shows that the mention was hurtful. The challenge is that the author's actions, while well-intentioned, didn't take into account how the sister might perceive it. Even if it's not about the author, their words can still affect the sister's feelings. The author might have been better off expressing their own emotions without focusing on the physical scars. \n\nBut the author's intention wasn't to shame or criticize. They felt it was necessary to address their own emotional state to prevent it from affecting their relationship. However, the sister might feel that the author is not respecting her boundaries by bringing up the scars. It's a delicate balance between self-expression and respecting others' trauma. \n\nIn similar situations, often the right approach is to address the underlying emotions without making the other person feel responsible. For example, the author could have talked to the sister about their sadness regarding her past without pointing out the scars. The sister's reaction indicates that the scars are still a sensitive topic for her, even if she's recovered. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't have ill intent, but the impact of their words caused harm. It's a case where the intention vs. impact is debated. Some might say the author is in the wrong because the action affected the sister's feelings, even if unintended. Others might say they were trying to communicate their own pain and the sister's reaction was unexpected. \n\nI think in this context, the author's approach might have been tactless. Instead of directly mentioning the scars, they could have sought a different way to express their concern. The answer might lean towards A (yes), because the author's action, though not malicious, did cause distress and could have been more considerate. However, the author was trying to be honest about their feelings, which is a valid approach. The answer might be B (no) if the focus is on the author's intent and their own emotional struggle. But the sister's trauma and the resulting sensitivity of the issue make the impact significant. \n\nI need to decide based on the principles of empathy and respect in relationships. The author should have considered that the scars might still be a trigger for the sister and found a more supportive way to express their feelings. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
