When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The author mentions that the sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying. The author feels upset seeing the scars because it reminds them of the bullying and makes them sad. They tried to mention it casually but it upset the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is in recovery and has come a long way, which is positive. The author's intention might be to avoid emotional distress, but the way they approached it was direct and led to the sister being upset. The key here is the sister's reaction. When the author mentioned the scars, the sister cried, indicating that the comment was hurtful or triggered bad memories. \n\nThe author acknowledges their own potential selfishness, which is a good sign, but the act of bringing up the scars without knowing the sister's current feelings about them might be the issue. The sister might want to show the scars as a way of coping or as a reminder of her strength, and the author's request to cover them could be perceived as invalidating her experience. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, the author might not have the right to dictate how their sister presents her body, even with good intentions. The sister's autonomy is important here. While the author's feelings are valid, they should also respect the sister's wishes and emotional state. The fact that the sister was upset suggests that the author's approach wasn't sensitive enough. \n\nSo, even though the author's intentions are good, the way they expressed their feelings might have been inappropriate. The answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's feelings and boundaries adequately, leading to a negative reaction. They should have approached the situation more gently, perhaps by discussing their feelings without directly asking her to cover up the scars.\n"
