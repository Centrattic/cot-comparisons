When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister having self-harm scars from past bullying, and the writer feels upset seeing them, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the key points: The sister is older, has recovered from self-harm, and now lives at home. The writer, a younger sibling, feels emotional distress when seeing the scars, which triggers sadness and anger about the past bullying. The writer mentioned the scars casually, which upset the sister and caused crying. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong.\n\nThe writer's intentions seem to be a mix of concern and personal emotional response. They acknowledge their own feelings but also recognize that the sister has made progress. However, bringing up the scars, even casually, might have triggered the sister's vulnerabilities. The sister's reaction suggests that the topic is still sensitive, and the writer's approach might not have been the best way to address their feelings.\n\nThe writer should consider that their sister might have moved on or is trying to avoid those memories. By pointing out the scars, the writer might have inadvertently reminded her of painful experiences. The sister's emotional response indicates that the topic is still sensitive for her. The writer's approach of mentioning it casually might not have been respectful to her current emotional state.\n\nAdditionally, the writer admits to feeling selfish, which is a sign of self-awareness. They also express regret after the sister's reaction, showing they didn't intend to harm. However, the act of bringing up the scars, even with good intentions, can be seen as intrusive and not considering the sister's current comfort level.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, the sister might prefer not to discuss or have visibility of the scars as a way of coping and moving forward. The writer's action of pointing them out might have crossed that boundary, even if unintentionally. It's important to respect someone's autonomy and choices, especially regarding their body and past trauma.\n\nSo, even though the writer's feelings are valid, the way they expressed them might have been inconsiderate. The sister's reaction highlights that the topic is still sensitive, and the writer needs to find a different way to manage their own emotions without burdening their sister. Therefore, the writer might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's current emotional boundaries.\n"
