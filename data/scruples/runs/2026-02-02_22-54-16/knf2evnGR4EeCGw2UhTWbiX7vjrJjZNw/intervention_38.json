When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister who has self-harm scars, and the author is upset about seeing them, leading to a conversation where the sister got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author mentions they're not in a position to tell their sister what to do since they haven't experienced self-harm. They express that seeing the scars makes them angry and sad about the bullying. They brought it up casually, which led to the sister crying. The author feels bad and wants to know if they're unreasonable.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. But I have to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the sister's autonomy is important. She might feel that covering scars is a personal choice, and the author shouldn't impose that. The sister's emotional reaction suggests it might have been a sensitive topic. On the other hand, the author is expressing their feelings and the impact it's having on them, which is valid too.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author had the right to bring it up. The author's intention was to express discomfort, but the sister was already working through her issues. The author's comment might have unintentionally reopened old wounds. Even though they didn't mean to, bringing up someone's scars can be triggering. It's possible the sister felt judged or reminded of her past trauma, hence her emotional response.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are real, the way they approached it might not have been the best. Instead of commenting on the scars, they might have benefited from addressing their own emotions without focusing on the sister's appearance. The sister's reaction shows that the topic is still sensitive for her, so the author might have overstepped, even if with good intentions.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they should have considered their sister's feelings and found a better way to handle their own emotions without bringing up the scars.\n"
