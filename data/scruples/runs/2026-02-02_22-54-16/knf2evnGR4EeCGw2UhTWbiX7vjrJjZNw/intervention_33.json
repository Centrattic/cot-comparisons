When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister having self-harm scars that the author is uncomfortable seeing, leading to a conversation that upset the sister. The author is wondering if they did the wrong thing by bringing it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, which was addressed with therapy. The scars are still visible. The author, who hasn't experienced self-harm, feels sad and angry when seeing the scars and mentioned it to the sister, causing her to cry. The author is questioning their approach, realizing they might be selfish by bringing it up.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions versus the impact. The author didn't intend to hurt their sister but was struggling with their own emotions. However, the sister's reaction indicates that the topic is sensitive. The author's mention of the scars, even if well-meaning, might have been a trigger for the sister. The question is whether the author overstepped by discussing the scars.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, self-harm scars can be a sensitive and painful reminder for someone who has experienced trauma. Even if the author's intention was to express concern, the sister might feel that the author is focusing on the scars rather than her progress. The author's approach might not have been empathetic enough, not considering how bringing up the scars could affect the sister emotionally.\n\nAdditionally, the author acknowledges that they are not in the right position to tell the sister what to do, which shows self-awareness. However, the act of mentioning the scars in a casual way without preparing for the emotional response could be seen as careless. The sister's reaction of crying suggests that the author's words were hurtful, even if unintended.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author's motivation is to feel less sad and angry, which is understandable, but the solution of asking the sister to cover the scars isn't feasible or respectful. The author needs to find a way to manage their own emotions without burdening the sister. The sister's autonomy over her body and her right to not cover up her scars is significant here.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be good, the method of addressing the issue was inappropriate. The author should have approached the sister with more sensitivity, maybe discussing their feelings without directly commenting on the scars. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their actions, although stemming from a place of concern, caused harm due to a lack of consideration for the sister's feelings and autonomy.\n"
