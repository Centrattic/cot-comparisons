When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe sister, who's older, had self-harmed in the past due to bullying. Now she has noticeable scars. The author, the younger sibling, feels upset seeing them because it reminds them of the bullying and makes them angry. They mentioned the scars casually, which upset the sister, leading to crying. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's scars are a sensitive topic. Self-harm is a serious issue, and scars can be a visible reminder of past trauma. The author is not in a position to judge or tell her what to do, as they haven't experienced self-harm themselves. However, the author is also a person with their own feelings, feeling sad and angry when seeing the scars. They mentioned it casually, which might have been a mistake.\n\nNow, the key points are: 1) The author's intention was to address their own emotional discomfort, but they didn't consider how bringing it up might affect their sister. 2) The sister got upset, indicating that the topic is still sensitive for her. 3) The author is struggling with guilt and wants to know if their approach was wrong.\n\nIn similar situations, it's often advised to approach sensitive topics with care and empathy. The author might have acted out of their own feelings without considering the sister's current emotional state. Even though their intention wasn't to hurt, the way they brought it up caused distress. The sister might feel that her scars are a part of her past and that being reminded of them is intrusive or invalidating of her progress.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but they are in the wrong for how they expressed those feelings. The mistake was not approaching the sister with support and understanding but instead mentioning it in a way that led to her emotional reaction. The author needs to focus on supporting their sister rather than making her feel she needs to hide her scars. The right approach would be to discuss their own feelings in a non-judgmental way, perhaps seeking to understand her feelings first and offering support instead of making a request to cover the scars.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't handle the sensitive topic with the necessary care and consideration for their sister's feelings, leading to unintended hurt.\n"
