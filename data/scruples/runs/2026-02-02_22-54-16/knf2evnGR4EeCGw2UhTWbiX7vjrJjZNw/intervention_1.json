When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their sister to cover self-harm scars, which upsets the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and now has visible scars. The author feels upset seeing them, but they acknowledge it's not about them. They tried to mention it casually, but the sister got upset and cried. The author feels bad and is questioning their actions.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's intention was to express discomfort, but they might not have realized how sensitive the topic is. The sister's emotional reaction is significant. The author admits they might be being selfish, which shows self-awareness. However, bringing up the scars in a casual manner might have been triggering for the sister, even if the author's intention was to address their own feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider boundaries and empathy. The author is trying to manage their own emotional response, which is valid, but in doing so, they may have crossed a line by making the sister feel pressured to cover her scars. The sister's scars are a part of her past, and she might be working on her recovery, so any comment about them could be perceived as invalidating her experience.\n\nThe sister's reaction\u2014crying\u2014indicates that the author's comment was hurtful, even if unintentionally. While the author wasn't trying to be malicious, the impact on the sister is what matters. The author needs to respect the sister's autonomy and her process of dealing with her trauma. It's possible that the author should focus on their own emotional response rather than asking the sister to change her appearance.\n\nSo, considering the intent and the impact, the author might be in the wrong because their actions, though perhaps well-meaning, caused emotional distress to their sister. The right approach would be to support the sister and seek ways to manage their own feelings without imposing on her. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
