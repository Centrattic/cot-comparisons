When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm, which the author finds upsetting. The author mentioned the scars once, and the sister got upset and cried. The author now feels bad and is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is younger, and the sister is older. The scars are from past self-harm, which has stopped. The author isn't in a position to tell the sister what to do, as they haven't experienced self-harm. They mentioned it casually, but that caused the sister emotional distress. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intention was to feel less upset by covering the scars, but their approach might not have been the best. The sister's reaction shows that the comment was hurtful. The author acknowledges their own potential selfishness. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the sister has the right to her body and how she presents herself. The author's request could be seen as intrusive or invalidating. On the other hand, the author is struggling with their emotions and trying to communicate their feelings. However, bringing up the scars in a way that caused the sister to cry might not be the right approach. The author should have considered the sister's feelings and perhaps approached it more sensitively, maybe by expressing their own feelings without making a direct request. \n\nAlternatives could include talking to a parent or a counselor, or finding ways to handle their own emotions without asking the sister to alter her appearance. Since the sister's scars are part of her past and she's done with therapy, the author's request might not be necessary. The sister might feel that the author is reminding her of a painful past. \n\nTherefore, the author's intention might be good, but the method was flawed. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional impact of their words on their sister. They didn't frame it as a personal struggle but instead as a request that the sister cover the scars, which could be seen as a demand. The right approach would be to express their own feelings without placing the burden on the sister. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. Let me check again. The author says they know they're being selfish, but they're asking if they're in the wrong. The sister's reaction indicates that the author's comment was hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to help, the action caused harm. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more carefully. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
