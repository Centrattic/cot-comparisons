When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has scars from self-harm due to past bullying. The author, who's younger, finds seeing the scars upsetting and brought it up, causing the sister to cry. The author is now worried they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom what I know, self-harm scars are a sensitive topic. The sister might be doing her best to cope and move on, and having someone point out the scars could be triggering or hurtful. The author mentions they don't want to judge but are struggling with their emotions. However, the sister's autonomy is important here. The scars are a part of her body, and unless there's an active risk, she should have the choice on how to present herself. The author's intention might be to avoid their own discomfort, which isn't a valid reason to ask someone to cover up. It's about respecting her boundaries and her healing process.\n\nThe sister's reaction suggests that the topic is still sensitive. The author's comment might have unintentionally invalidated her experience or made her feel like she's causing discomfort. It's possible the author isn't in the wrong in terms of intention, but the action of bringing it up could be seen as crossing a line. The key here is whether the author had the right to make that request. Since it's the sister's decision and the author's own feelings shouldn't override that, the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong. They should focus on managing their own emotions rather than asking the sister to change her behavior.\n"
