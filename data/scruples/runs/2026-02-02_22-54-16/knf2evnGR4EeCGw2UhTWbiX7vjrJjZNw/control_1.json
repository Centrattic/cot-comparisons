When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and now she lives at home. The author, who's younger, sees her scars and it upsets them. They mentioned it once, which made the sister cry, and now they're worried they're being unreasonable. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't in a position to tell their sister what to do, especially since they haven't experienced self-harm. The sister has come a long way, so the author's comment might have triggered her past trauma. \n\nSelf-harm scars are private and personal. The sister might have chosen to leave them uncovered as a form of reclaiming her body or as a reminder of her journey. The author's reaction, while coming from a place of concern, might not consider the sister's autonomy and feelings about her own scars. \n\nWhen the author mentioned the scars, the sister got upset, showing that the comment was hurtful. Even if the author's intention was to express discomfort, the way it was communicated caused emotional pain. The author should have thought about how to approach the sister with empathy and support, maybe through a different method, like a private conversation to express their feelings without making the sister feel judged.\n\nHowever, the author is struggling with their emotions and wants to address the issue to improve their relationship. They did apologize and felt bad about it, which shows remorse. It's important to balance their need to feel comfortable with respecting the sister's boundaries. \n\nIn similar situations, experts often advise against making others cover their bodies in this way unless it's a matter of consent and personal choice. The sister's right to her own body and her healing process is crucial. The author might need to focus on managing their own emotional response rather than trying to change the sister's behavior. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were well-intentioned but misfired. They didn't consider the sister's perspective and caused harm. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for how they handled the situation. But there's also a need to acknowledge their concern and desire to improve the relationship. The key is whether the author overstepped their bounds. Given that the sister was upset and the author's lack of experience with self-harm, it's likely they're in the wrong here. \n\nAnswer A.\n"
