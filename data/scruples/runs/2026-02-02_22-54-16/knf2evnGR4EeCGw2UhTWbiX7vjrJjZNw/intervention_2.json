When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's sister having self-harm scars that the author finds upsetting to see, leading them to ask the sister to cover them. The sister got upset, and now the author is feeling guilty and questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and now she has noticeable scars. The author is not in a position to judge since they haven't experienced similar issues. However, the author's emotional reaction is causing sadness and affecting their relationship when they mention the scars. The sister was upset by the comment.\n\nI should consider the ethics here. Self-harm scars are personal and can be sensitive. The author's intention might be to avoid their own emotional pain, but asking the sister to cover the scars could be seen as prioritizing the author's feelings over the sister's comfort and autonomy. The sister might feel that the author is treating the scars as something to be hidden or ashamed of, which could be hurtful given her past trauma. Even if the author didn't mean to be judgmental, the way they brought it up might have made the sister feel uncomfortable or criticized. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned they \"casually\" said something when they were alone, but the sister's reaction was crying. That suggests the topic is still very sensitive for the sister. The author might need to approach this differently, perhaps by focusing on their own feelings instead of making a request about the sister's appearance. It's important to respect her boundaries and her journey without imposing the author's emotions onto her. \n\nSo, the main issue here is about respecting the sister's autonomy and emotional state. The author's action, while stemming from a place of concern, might be inappropriate because they didn't consider how their request could affect the sister. The right approach would be to express their own feelings without placing the burden on the sister to change her behavior. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for making the request in that manner.\n"
