When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister's self-harm scars and the author's reaction to them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is the younger sibling, and their older sister has visible scars from past self-harm due to bullying. The author says it upsets them to see the scars, which makes them feel sad and angry about the bullying. They mentioned the scars once in passing, and the sister got upset and cried. Now, the author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the key points here: The sister has a history of self-harm but has recovered with therapy. The author's emotional response is valid because they care about their sister, but they didn't confront her about the scars directly. They just mentioned seeing them, which triggered the sister's emotional reaction. The author feels bad for bringing it up and is confused if they did wrong.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective: she might be sensitive about her scars. Even though they're from the past, they can be a reminder of trauma. The sister might not want to talk about it, or she might feel embarrassed. The author's mention, even if casual, could have reminded her of painful memories or made her feel judged.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to express their feelings without being intrusive. They acknowledged not being in the right place to tell her what to do, which shows they respect her autonomy. However, they didn't consider that bringing up the scars might trigger negative emotions in their sister. \n\nThe problem here is about emotional sensitivity. While the author had good intentions, the way they approached it might not have considered their sister's current emotional state. The sister's reaction (crying) indicates that the mention was hurtful. The author might not have realized the emotional weight of the scars on their sister. Even if it was a casual comment, the sister might feel that her past is being highlighted in a negative way, or that her recovery isn't being respected. \n\nIn relationships, especially within family, it's important to communicate in a way that considers the other person's feelings. The author's own feelings are valid, but they need to balance them with their sister's well-being. The sister might be doing well, but the scars could still be a sensitive topic. The author's mention could be seen as prying or retraumatizing, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot here. They care about their sister's well-being but also have their own emotional reactions. However, the sister's reaction suggests that the author's comment was not the right approach. The author should have found a better way to express their feelings without bringing up the scars directly. Maybe discussing their own feelings of sadness and anger in a way that doesn't focus on the scars themselves. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they brought up a sensitive topic that upset their sister, even if unintentionally, without considering her current emotional state. They need to be more mindful of how their words affect others, especially when dealing with past trauma.\n"
