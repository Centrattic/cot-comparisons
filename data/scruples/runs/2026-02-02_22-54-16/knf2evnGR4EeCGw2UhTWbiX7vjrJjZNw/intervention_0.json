When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's older sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied at 17. The sister is now doing better, but the author feels upset seeing the scars, which triggers sadness and anger because they can't believe someone bullied her so badly. The author mentioned the scars casually, and the sister got upset and cried. Now the author is questioning if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to talk about the scars, but maybe in a way that was insensitive. The sister has a history of self-harm and therapy, so she might be very sensitive about the topic. The author's sister might feel that bringing up the scars is prying or makes her relive the trauma. Even if the author's intention was to express concern, the sister might perceive it as a criticism or an unwanted focus on her past pain. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their emotions and wants to support their sister but is finding it hard. They didn't force the sister to cover up, just mentioned that they can see the scars. However, the sister's reaction was strong, which suggests that the topic is a trigger for her. The key here is how the sister feels. The author should respect her boundaries and feelings, even if they didn't mean to hurt her. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, communication is crucial. If the author wants to address their feelings, they need to approach the sister with empathy and ask how she feels about the scars, rather than making the sister responsible for covering them. The sister's autonomy and emotional well-being should take precedence. The author's action, even if well-intentioned, might have been a breach of trust or an invasion of the sister's personal space. So, the answer might be A, but I need to check if the author's approach was appropriate. The sister might not want to talk about it, and the author should have considered that before bringing it up. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't approach the situation with enough sensitivity, possibly causing the sister distress. The right approach would be to seek understanding and support without making the sister feel judged or uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
