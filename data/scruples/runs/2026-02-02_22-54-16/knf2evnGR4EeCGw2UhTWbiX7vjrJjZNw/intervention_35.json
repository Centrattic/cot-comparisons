When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with self-harm scars that the author finds upsetting.\n\nFirst, the author's sister had a history of self-harm due to bullying, which stopped after therapy. Now, she has noticeable scars. The author mentions the scars, which upsets the sister. The author is struggling with their feelings and the impact on their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the sister's reaction. The author didn't criticize or judge the sister but mentioned the scars in a casual way. However, the sister got upset and cried. The author is concerned about being selfish because they're focusing on their own emotional response.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention wasn't to hurt. They tried to express their feelings but didn't do so in a way that was confrontational. However, the sister's reaction shows that the mention triggered painful memories. The author might not have considered how the mention could affect the sister emotionally. But they also expressed support and pride for her recovery.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong by mentioning the scars. Since the author intended to be supportive and the sister's reaction was emotional, it's possible that the author didn't handle it the best way, but they might not be entirely wrong. The sister might need space, and the author should approach the situation with more sensitivity in the future. However, the initial mention wasn't malicious. So, the answer might be B, but there's nuance. The author isn't in the wrong, but could improve communication.\n"
