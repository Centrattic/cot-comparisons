When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, the context: the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, now has therapy and has improved. The author is upset seeing the scars, feels sad and angry, and mentioned it to her sister, causing her to cry. The author is unsure if they were wrong to bring it up.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author's intention was likely to express their feelings, but the sister was upset by the comment. The key points are the sister's past trauma and the author's reaction. The author acknowledges they're not the one who self-harmed and that it's not about them. However, bringing up the scars might have triggered the sister, even if the intention was not to hurt her.\n\nIn these situations, it's important to consider the impact on the person with the trauma. Even if the author's intent was to cope with their own emotions, the sister's emotional response is significant. The author's comment, even if casual, led to the sister crying, which suggests that the author's words were hurtful. \n\nThe author might not have realized how sensitive the topic is for the sister. The sister might feel that her scars are a personal and painful reminder of her past, and the author mentioning them could make her feel exposed or judged, even unintentionally. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their own feelings of sadness and anger, which is understandable given the knowledge of the sister's past. However, the way to address that might involve supporting the sister without making her feel that her scars are an issue. \n\nThe author's approach might need to be more empathetic and considerate of the sister's feelings. Instead of focusing on covering the scars, the author should perhaps seek support for themselves or find ways to address their own emotional response without imposing on the sister. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be rooted in concern or their own emotional struggle, the act of bringing up the scars likely caused harm. The sister's well-being and comfort are paramount here, so the author's approach might be seen as insensitive, even if unintended. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
