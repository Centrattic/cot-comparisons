When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault (AITA) for telling their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister is older, has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and has scars that the author finds upsetting. The author mentioned the scars casually, and the sister got upset, crying. Now the author is feeling guilty and wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's feelings and the context. Self-harm scars can be a sensitive topic. The sister went through a traumatic experience, and the scars are a physical reminder of that. The author admits they don't have experience with depression or self-harm, so they might not fully understand the sister's perspective.\n\nThe author's motivation is that seeing the scars makes them angry and sad about the sister's past. But the sister's feelings about her own body and scars might be different. The author brought up the topic in a casual way, which the sister reacted to with distress. That suggests that the sister might not be comfortable discussing the scars or being told to cover them, even if the author's intention was to express concern.\n\nI should think about boundaries. The sister has the right to decide how she wants to present her body. Unless there's a risk of further harm, the author shouldn't impose their feelings onto the sister. The author's reaction is based on their own emotions, which isn't the sister's responsibility to manage. \n\nAlso, the author's comment affected their relationship negatively. The sister was upset, so the approach might have been inappropriate. Instead of asking her to cover the scars, the author might have benefited from expressing their feelings in a more supportive way, perhaps focusing on wanting to support the sister rather than making her alter her appearance.\n\nBut then again, the author's intention was to avoid seeing something that distressed them. However, the sister's autonomy is important. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of having strong feelings, but they are in the wrong in how they expressed it, by making a request that's based on their own emotional needs rather than respecting the sister's autonomy and past.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong). They tried to impose their own emotional response onto the sister without considering her feelings about her own body and scars.\n"
