When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again.\n\nThe author has a sister who self-harmed in the past due to bullying. The sister now has visible scars on her arms. The author is upset seeing these scars because it makes them angry about the bullying their sister went through. They mentioned it once, and the sister got upset and cried. Now the author feels bad and is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries, empathy, and how to support a sibling with a history of self-harm. The author acknowledges they aren't in the right position to tell their sister what to do, which shows some self-awareness. But they're struggling with their own emotional reaction to the scars. \n\nSelf-harm scars are a sensitive topic. For the sister, they're a reminder of a painful past, even if she's recovered. The author's comment might have unintentionally triggered her. The fact that she got upset and cried suggests that bringing up the scars was hurtful, even if the author's intention was to express their own feelings of sadness and anger. \n\nIn relationships, especially between siblings, it's important to consider how our actions and words affect others. The author's reaction is rooted in their own emotions, but they need to balance that with respecting their sister's feelings and boundaries. The sister might have chosen to be open about her arms as a way of coping or being comfortable, and the author's comment might have made her feel judged or reminded of her trauma. \n\nThe author tried to address it casually, but maybe they should have found a different way to express their feelings without directly pointing out the scars. Maybe they could have expressed their sadness about her past without focusing on the physical scars. It's possible that the sister doesn't want to discuss it or doesn't want to be reminded of her self-harm in front of others. \n\nSo, even though the author's intention wasn't to hurt, the action did cause harm. The question is whether that makes them in the wrong. The author is in a difficult position, trying to manage their own feelings while not wanting to upset their sister. But the way they approached it might not have been the best. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't anticipate the emotional impact on their sister. However, it's also possible that they acted from a place of concern. But in this context, the sister's emotional response is significant. The author should consider not bringing up the scars again and finding another way to support each other without triggering negative emotions. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their comment, even if well-intentioned, caused distress and they need to take responsibility for that. They should focus on supporting their sister without making her feel uncomfortable or judged.\n"
