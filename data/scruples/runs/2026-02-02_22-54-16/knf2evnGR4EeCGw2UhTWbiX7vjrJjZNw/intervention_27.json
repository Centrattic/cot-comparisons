When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let's read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is talking about their sister who used to self-harm due to bullying and now has scars. The sister lives at home and often leaves her arms bare. The author says that seeing the scars makes them feel angry and sad, and it's affecting their relationship. They mentioned the scars casually, and the sister got upset. Now the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The sister has a history of self-harm, which is a serious issue. The author isn't in a position to judge or tell her what to do, as they haven't experienced that. The author's feelings are valid\u2014they feel sad and angry when they see the scars, which is a natural reaction to thinking about the sister's past trauma. However, bringing up the scars, even casually, might have been unintentionally hurtful. The sister reacted emotionally, so maybe the author's comment, even if well-intentioned, was sensitive.\n\nBut the author tried to handle it by just mentioning it when they were alone. They didn't confront the sister or demand anything, just mentioned that they could see the scars. The problem is that the sister got upset, and the author feels bad about it. The key here is whether the author had the right to bring up the topic. Since the scars are a part of the sister's past and current identity, she might feel that covering them is a personal choice. The author's desire to avoid seeing them might be a personal preference, but it's important to respect the sister's autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't asking the sister to cover up for any judgmental reason; they're just trying to protect their own mental state. However, the sister's comfort and emotional state should also be considered. The author might not have realized how sensitive the topic is for the sister. Even if the intention was good, the sister's reaction suggests that the topic is still painful for her.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they expressed their feelings in a non-confrontational way and apologized when they realized it upset the sister. However, they might not have considered the sister's perspective enough. The sister might feel that her scars are a part of her healing journey and that being asked to cover them could be seen as dismissive of her past. The author's reaction, however, is also valid because they're struggling with their emotions. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid feelings. The answer might depend on whether the author's request was made in a respectful and understanding manner, which it seems they did. So maybe the answer is B (they aren't in the wrong), but there's room for the author to approach the situation more sensitively in the future.\n"
