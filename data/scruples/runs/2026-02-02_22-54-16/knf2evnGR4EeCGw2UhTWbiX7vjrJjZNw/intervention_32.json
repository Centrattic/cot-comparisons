When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars, which is causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying and has scars. The author mentions that seeing the scars makes them sad and angry, leading to emotional discomfort. However, when the author casually mentioned the scars, the sister became upset and cried. The author feels bad about bringing it up and is now questioning their actions.\n\nFrom what I know, self-harm is a sensitive topic. The sister might feel that her scars are a private matter or a reminder of her past trauma. The author's intention was to avoid seeing the scars because it affects their emotional state, but they might not have considered how bringing it up could retraumatize the sister or make her feel self-conscious.\n\nThe key points here are the author's motivation and the sister's reaction. The author isn't telling the sister to hide her scars for control but because it upsets them. However, in doing so, they might be imposing their feelings on someone else who has already endured significant pain. The sister's emotional response indicates that the topic is still sensitive for her.\n\nEven though the author acknowledges their potential selfishness, the act of bringing up the scars could be seen as invalidating the sister's experience. It's important to respect someone's autonomy and their journey with their scars. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of having those feelings, but how they expressed it\u2014by mentioning the scars directly\u2014could be hurtful. The sister's distress suggests that the author's approach was inappropriate, even if their intention was to protect themselves from emotional pain.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation carefully and inadvertently caused more harm. The right approach would be to manage their own emotions without imposing on the sister's comfort. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
