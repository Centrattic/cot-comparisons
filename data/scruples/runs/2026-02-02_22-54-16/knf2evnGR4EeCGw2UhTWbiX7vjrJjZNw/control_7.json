When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying. The author mentions that seeing the scars makes them upset and angry because of the bullying their sister endured. They tried to bring it up casually but it made their sister cry, which made them feel bad.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister's autonomy, the author's emotional reaction, and how they approached the situation. Self-harm scars are a sensitive topic. Even though the author's intention might be to protect their sister's feelings or their own emotional well-being, approaching it by asking to cover them could be seen as invalidating the sister's experience. The sister might feel that the scars are a part of her journey and that covering them is unnecessary unless it's her own choice. The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto the sister, not considering that the sister might be okay with showing them now. Also, bringing it up in a casual way might not be the best approach. It's possible that the sister is sensitive about the topic, and the author's mention of the scars triggered her, leading to her emotional reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't asking to hide the scars for their own sake but because it's affecting their relationship and causing them sadness. However, the sister's autonomy in how she presents her body is important. The author should respect that unless there's a health or safety concern, which there isn't here.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're coming from a place of caring, but their approach was problematic. They should have focused on their own feelings without making the sister feel like she needs to cover up. The better approach would be to seek support for their own emotions rather than asking the sister to change her behavior. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but with the caveat that their method was inappropriate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether their approach was good. Since they expressed concern in a way that upset the sister, maybe they are in the wrong. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking. If the sister has the right to show her scars, then the author's request could be seen as overstepping. So maybe A (Yes). But the author is trying to manage their own emotions, which isn't the sister's responsibility. So, the answer might be A. Hmm, conflicting thoughts here. Let's see examples. If someone has scars from past trauma and someone else asks them to cover them up, that could be seen as invalidating. The author's action might be considered wrong because it's the sister's choice. But the author isn't forcing, just asking. However, even that can be hurtful. The answer might be A because the author's request is imposing their feelings on the sister, which is not appropriate. So, the answer is A.\n"
