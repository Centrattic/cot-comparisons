When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars, and the sister got upset. The author is worried they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The sister has a history of self-harm from being bullied, which the parents caught and she got therapy. Now, the scars are visible. The author, who hasn't experienced this themselves, says that seeing the scars makes them angry and sad, which affects their relationship. They mentioned the scars once, and the sister cried. The author feels bad for bringing it up but is unsure if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister's autonomy and emotional state, the author's feelings, and the impact of their comment. \n\nSelf-harm scars are a sensitive issue. Even if the sister has recovered, those scars are part of her body and her past. The author is trying to protect themselves emotionally by asking her to cover them. But is that the right approach? \n\nFrom one angle, the author isn't in the sister's shoes, so they might not understand how covering up the scars affects her. Maybe the sister is proud of her recovery, or maybe she's okay with showing them as a reminder. On the other hand, the author's feelings are valid too; they're upset by the sight of the scars because they remind them of the bullying and the sister's suffering. \n\nHowever, the problem is that the author is asking the sister to change her behavior (covering her arms) to accommodate the author's emotions. That could be seen as placing the author's needs on the sister, which might not be fair. The sister's comfort and autonomy should be a priority. The author's comment made the sister upset, which indicates that the way the author approached it was hurtful, even if their intent was to express their own discomfort.\n\nBut the author didn't force the sister to cover up; they just mentioned seeing the scars. The sister's reaction was immediate, so maybe the author's way of bringing it up wasn't the right approach. The author should have considered how their words might be received and perhaps found a more supportive way to express their feelings without making the sister feel blamed or judged.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to express their feelings. However, the way they did it without considering the sister's perspective could be problematic. The key is whether the author had the right to ask the sister to cover the scars. Since the scars are a part of the sister's body and her history, the author doesn't have the authority to request that. The author should respect the sister's choice to show or hide the scars as she wishes. Instead of asking her to cover them, the author might need to work on their own emotional response, perhaps through therapy or setting personal boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they asked the sister to alter her appearance for the author's emotional comfort, which is a matter of the sister's autonomy. However, there's a nuance here since the author's intent was not malicious but stemmed from their own feelings. Still, the impact on the sister is significant, so the author's action, though perhaps well-meaning, was inappropriate."
