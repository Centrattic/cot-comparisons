When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the sister who asked her older sister to cover her self-harm scars is in the wrong. The context is that the older sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying, and the younger sister finds it upsetting to see them, which affects her emotionally. The older sister got upset when the younger sister mentioned the scars.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional states of both sisters. The older sister has a history of trauma and self-harm, which is a serious mental health issue. The younger sister is trying to express her feelings about seeing the scars, but it's clear she's not in a position to dictate how the older sister should present herself. The key here is whether the younger sister overstepped by asking her sister to cover the scars.\n\nThe younger sister mentions she's not in the right position to tell her what to do, which shows she's aware of her sister's autonomy. However, bringing up the scars in a way that caused her sister to cry might have been done without considering the emotional impact. The younger sister's intention might have been to express her feelings, but the method could have been more empathetic.\n\nOn the other hand, the older sister might feel that her scars are a private matter, and the younger sister's reaction could be seen as intrusive. The fact that the younger sister's comment affected their relationship suggests that the approach was problematic. The main issue here is the younger sister's handling of the situation rather than the request itself. It's about how she communicated her feelings without considering her sister's sensitivity around the topic.\n\nSo, the younger sister is trying to manage her own emotions, which is valid, but the way she addressed it might have been inappropriate. The answer would likely be that she's in the wrong because she didn't approach the conversation with sufficient care and understanding of her sister's trauma. They should find a way to support each other without imposing their feelings on each other.\n"
