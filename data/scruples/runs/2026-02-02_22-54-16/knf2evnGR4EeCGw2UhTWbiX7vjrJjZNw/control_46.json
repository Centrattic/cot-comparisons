When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation. The sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied. The author, their sibling, is upset seeing the scars because it makes them angry and sad about the bullying. They mentioned the scars casually, which upset the sister and caused her to cry. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to bring it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has a history of self-harm, which is a serious issue. The author isn't telling her to cover up the scars permanently, just to cover them when at home. But the sister's reaction was emotional, so the author's comment clearly hurt her. \n\nThe key points are: the author's intent was to express their feelings, but they might not have considered how their words would affect the sister. The sister's scars are a sensitive topic, and bringing it up could trigger negative emotions. Even if the author's intention was to seek a solution (like covering the scars), the way they approached it was probably too direct or unconsidered. \n\nThe author acknowledges their possible selfishness and that it's not about them. That shows some self-awareness. However, the sister might feel that her past is being highlighted in a way that's uncomfortable, especially in a private setting. The author's comment, even if well-meaning, might have been a violation of the sister's boundaries. \n\nIn situations involving trauma, it's important to approach with empathy and understanding. The author might have thought they were helping, but without the sister's consent or prior discussion about the topic, it's easy to cause harm. The sister's emotional response indicates that the author's actions were inappropriate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were likely inconsiderate and crossed a boundary, making them at least partially in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes) because the author's comment upset the sister and didn't consider her feelings adequately.\n"
