When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The scenario involves the sister having a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the author is upset seeing the scars. The author mentioned it once, and the sister got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of self-harm, which is a sensitive issue. The author is not in a position to dictate what the sister should do with her body, especially since she's older and has been through a lot. The author's intention might be concern, but the way it was approached led to a negative reaction. \n\nThe key points here: The author expressed their discomfort in a casual manner, which upset the sister. Even though the author's intent was to protect their feelings, it's important to respect the sister's autonomy. The sister might feel that the author is judging her or bringing up past trauma unnecessarily. The author also acknowledges their own limitations in understanding the sister's experience, which shows some self-awareness.\n\nHowever, the sister's well-being is the priority. If the scars are a result of past issues that are now resolved, the sister might have a right to decide how she wants to present herself. The author's emotional reaction is valid, but the approach to address it needs to be more considerate and supportive. Maybe the author should focus on their own emotional response rather than asking the sister to cover up, which could be seen as invalidating her healing process.\n\nSo, the author's action might not be malicious, but the method was inappropriate. The sister's feelings are valid, and the author's comment caused distress. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not approaching the situation in a more supportive and understanding way.\n"
