When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars.\n\nSo the situation is that the sister has scars from self-harm due to past bullying. She's now doing better but the author sees the scars and gets upset, which makes them feel sad and angry. The author mentioned it once, and the sister was upset. Now the author is worried they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She's the one who went through the trauma and has the scars. She might feel that her body is her own, and others shouldn't comment on it. The author's comment might have made her feel judged or like her past is being brought up again, which could be triggering.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't telling her what to do, just expressing their feelings. They mentioned it casually, not in a confrontational way. But even so, the sister's reaction was strong. Maybe the author should have been more cautious or found another way to handle their feelings without bringing it up.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author isn't asking the sister to cover them in public or anything. It's about their own emotional response when they're at home. The author might be struggling with the emotional impact of seeing the scars, which is understandable. However, the sister's autonomy and her right to feel comfortable in her own home with her family are important too.\n\nThe key here is that the author's comment led to the sister being upset, which is a clear sign that the approach might not have been the best. The author admits they feel selfish for being upset, which shows they recognize the sensitivity. But by bringing it up, they might have invaded the sister's personal space and triggered her.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is not necessarily malicious. They want to support their sister but are struggling with their emotions. However, the way they expressed their feelings caused harm. It's possible the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how the sister might react and didn't handle it in a more supportive way, like talking about their own feelings without making the sister feel criticized.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they expressed their feelings in a way that upset their sister, even if their intent was to be concerned. They should have found a better way to manage their emotions without affecting the sister's well-being.\n"
