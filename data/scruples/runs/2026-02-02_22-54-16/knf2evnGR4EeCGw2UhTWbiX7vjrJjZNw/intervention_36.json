When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars, which makes them upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and now she has visible scars. The author, who's younger, is uncomfortable seeing them because it makes them sad and angry about the past. The sister got upset when the author mentioned the scars.\n\nThe author is trying to navigate their feelings without being judgmental. They acknowledge that it's not their place to tell her what to do, which shows some awareness. But they're struggling with their own emotional response.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, self-harm is a serious issue, and the sister's scars are a part of her past. The author's intention might be to avoid triggering their own sadness, but bringing up the scars could inadvertently make the sister feel vulnerable or judged. Even if the author didn't mean to, the sister's emotional reaction is valid. \n\nThe author's approach was to mention it casually, but maybe they didn't consider how it might affect the sister. The sister might feel that covering the scars is a reminder of her trauma, and the author's request could be seen as a demand for her to hide her history, which isn't fair. The author's feelings are valid, but the way they approached it might not be respectful of the sister's autonomy and healing process.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's feelings and how their request could be perceived. The key here is that the author prioritized their own discomfort over the sister's well-being and autonomy. Even if the author's intent was good, the impact was harmful. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
