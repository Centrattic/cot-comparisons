When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break it down. The situation is about the author's sister having self-harm scars from being bullied, which the author finds upsetting to see. The author mentioned the scars to her sister, who got upset and cried. Now the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and it's resolved now with therapy. The author is struggling with seeing the scars, feeling sad and angry about the past. The sister is now an adult living at home, and the author feels conflicted about bringing it up.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's intention was to ask the sister to cover the scars, but they mentioned it casually, leading to the sister's emotional reaction. The author acknowledges they're not in the right position to tell her what to do, which shows some self-awareness. However, bringing up the scars might have triggered the sister's past trauma. The sister's reaction indicates that the topic is still sensitive for her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action might be seen as well-meaning but poorly executed. The sister's autonomy and emotional well-being are important. By mentioning the scars, the author might have unintentionally invalidated the sister's experiences or made her feel self-conscious again. The author should have considered the sister's feelings and perhaps approached it more sensitively, if at all necessary. However, the author's motivation wasn't malicious, so it's not a clear-cut case of being wrong. But in terms of being in the wrong, since the sister was hurt, the author might have overstepped, even with good intentions. So the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they brought up a sensitive topic without considering the sister's feelings, leading to a negative reaction.\n"
