When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from when she was bullied and self-harmed as a teenager. The author, who's younger, feels upset and angry when they see the scars, which affects their relationship. They mentioned it casually, and the sister got upset and cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. Self-harm scars can be a sensitive topic. The sister might not want to be reminded of her past trauma, or she might feel that others are judging her. The author's motivation is concern, but the way they brought it up might have been inappropriate. They admit it was selfish and that it's not about them, which is important. \n\nThen, the sister's emotional reaction suggests that the comment was hurtful. Even if the author didn't mean to be, bringing up the scars without a clear, supportive reason can make the sister feel uncomfortable or retraumatized. The author should be careful not to impose their feelings onto the sister. The sister might be proud of overcoming her struggles and not want to hide her scars, or she might be self-conscious, but either way, the decision to cover them should be hers. \n\nThe author is in a position where they might not fully understand the sister's experience, so it's crucial to respect her autonomy. Maybe they should focus on supporting her in other ways instead of asking her to cover up. Also, the fact that the author feels sad around the sister could be discussed in a way that addresses their own emotions without making the sister feel like she has to hide her past. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intention was not malicious, but the action still caused harm. The sister's trauma and current feelings about her scars should take precedence. The author might have overstepped by making a request without considering the sister's feelings and boundaries. The right approach here is to validate the sister's experience and offer support rather than making her cover her scars. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
