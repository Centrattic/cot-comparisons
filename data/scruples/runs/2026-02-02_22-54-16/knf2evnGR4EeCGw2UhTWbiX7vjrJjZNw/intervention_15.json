When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The situation involves the sister's past with bullying and self-harm, which the parents addressed through therapy. Now, the sister lives at home and the author feels upset seeing the scars, which triggers sadness and anger over the bullying. The author mentioned it casually, causing the sister to cry, and now they're unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's intention was likely to express discomfort without judgment, but the sister's reaction shows that the topic is sensitive. The key points are the author's emotional response versus the sister's current state and autonomy. The author acknowledges their own lack of experience with self-harm, which is important. They also admit they might be being selfish, which shows self-awareness.\n\nHowever, the sister has the right to her body and how she chooses to present it. The author's request could be seen as imposing their feelings on the sister, even if well-meaning. The sister's emotional response indicates that the scars are still a sensitive issue for her. The author's mention of the scars might have unintentionally triggered her trauma or made her feel judged, even if the author didn't intend to.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their own emotions and trying to communicate their feelings. But in doing so, they may not have considered the sister's perspective fully. The main issue here is whether the author has the right to ask the sister to cover her scars when it's affecting their relationship. The sister's autonomy is crucial here; she has the right to decide how to handle her scars, especially since she's made progress in her recovery.\n\nSo, while the author's intention might be to protect their own emotional state, they need to respect the sister's boundaries and autonomy. The wrong here might be the approach rather than the intent. The sister's feelings and her right to manage her own body should take precedence. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's agency in this matter, even if their goal was to seek comfort.\n"
