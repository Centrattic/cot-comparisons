When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the author feels upset seeing the scars, which makes them angry and sad. The sister got upset when the author mentioned it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author admits they're not in the right place to tell their sister what to do, which shows some self-awareness. They mention that their feelings are making them sad and affecting the relationship. However, the sister's scars are a result of past trauma, and she might be comfortable showing them now. The author's comment upset the sister, so there's a conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author isn't telling her to cover up for their own comfort without considering the sister's feelings. But they did bring it up, which the sister found upsetting. The key here is whether the author had the right to make that request. The sister's autonomy is important. Even if the author's intention is to protect or avoid sadness, the sister's choice to show her scars (if she's okay with it) should be respected. The author's approach might have been too direct without understanding the sister's current feelings about her scars. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's perspective and boundaries, even if their intention was good. On the other hand, the author is struggling with their emotions and wants to help. But the sister's well-being and autonomy should come first. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they overstepped by making the request without considering the sister's current comfort level.\n"
