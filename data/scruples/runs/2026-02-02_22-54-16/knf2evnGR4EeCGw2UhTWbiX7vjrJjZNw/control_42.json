When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying and has recovered with therapy. The author is upset seeing the scars, feeling angry about the bullying and sad, which affects their relationship. The sister got upset when the author mentioned the scars.\n\nThe key points here: The author didn't confront the sister about her self-harm but mentioned the scars, which made the sister emotional. The author acknowledges they aren't in the right position to tell her what to do. The sister's scars are a part of her past, and she's in recovery. The author's intention was to express discomfort, not to judge or criticize.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective, scars can be a sensitive topic. People in recovery might find it hurtful when others focus on the scars, as it could trigger negative memories or feelings of shame. The author's mention might have unintentionally invalidated her progress or made her feel self-conscious. \n\nBut the author's intention was to express their feelings, albeit in a way that upset the sister. The question is whether the author overstepped. Since the author approached it casually and felt bad afterward, it's possible they didn't intend to hurt her. However, the fact that the sister was upset shows the conversation didn't go well. \n\nIn these situations, the right approach might have been to talk about their own feelings without directly asking the sister to cover the scars. The author's own emotional reaction is valid, but the method of addressing it might have been wrong. So, they might be in the wrong for making the sister feel worse instead of finding another way to cope with their feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's reaction is understandable given her history. The author's well-meaning but ill-timed comment could have been triggering. The author should consider whether their own feelings are being managed in a way that respects the sister's recovery. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's action was intrusive. Since the author didn't force anything but just mentioned it, but the sister was hurt, the author might be at fault for not handling the situation better. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, if the author's intent was to help but the method was wrong, maybe B. Hmm.\n"
