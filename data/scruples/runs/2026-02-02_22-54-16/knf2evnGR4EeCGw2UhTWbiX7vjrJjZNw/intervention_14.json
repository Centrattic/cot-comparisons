When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying and now has visible scars. The author mentioned the scars, which upset the sister.\n\nFirst, the author isn't telling her to cover them as a demand, but maybe just bringing it up casually. The sister got upset, so maybe the approach was wrong. But the author is struggling with their emotions seeing the scars. \n\nIs the author being selfish? They admit it's not about them, but they're upset. However, the sister's feelings are key here. The author's comment made the sister cry, which is hurtful. Even if the intent was to express discomfort, the way it was done might be inappropriate. The author should consider that the scars are part of the sister's past and she might not want to hide them. The author's emotional reaction doesn't justify making the sister feel bad. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more sensitively.\n"
