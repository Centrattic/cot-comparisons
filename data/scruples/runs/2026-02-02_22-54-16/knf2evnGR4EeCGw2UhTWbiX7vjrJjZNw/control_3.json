When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm, and the author feels upset seeing them, which is affecting their relationship. The sister got upset when the author mentioned it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author acknowledges that the scars are from a traumatic experience (bullying) and that the sister has made progress. The author is aware they can't relate to her experience and that they might be being selfish. However, they feel emotionally affected, leading to sadness and affecting their relationship. The sister reacted strongly to the comment.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author's intention isn't to judge but to express discomfort. However, bringing up the scars might reopen wounds or make the sister feel criticized. The sister's reaction (crying) suggests that the author's words hurt her feelings. The author might not realize that the scars are a sensitive topic for the sister, even if she's recovered.\n\nBut the author is also struggling with their own emotions. They feel angry about the bullying and upset seeing the scars. They might not know how to handle these feelings without impacting their sister. The key is whether the author overstepped by asking her to cover them, which is a personal choice. The sister might see it as the author not trusting her recovery or wanting to hide her past.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were likely born from concern but expressed in a way that hurt the sister. Since the sister got upset, the author's approach might be inappropriate. However, the author isn't trying to invalidate the sister's experience but to cope with their own emotions. It's a complex situation where both parties are dealing with their feelings, but the author's mention of the scars directly affected the sister negatively. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but I need to check if there's any nuance I missed.\n\nAnother angle: The author didn't ask the sister to cover them directly but mentioned seeing the scars. However, the sister might perceive it as a request to cover them. The author's intention was to address their own discomfort, which is valid, but the method caused harm. Since the sister is in recovery, the author might need to find another way to handle their feelings without burdening the sister. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the sister's feelings sufficiently in how they expressed their own.\n"
