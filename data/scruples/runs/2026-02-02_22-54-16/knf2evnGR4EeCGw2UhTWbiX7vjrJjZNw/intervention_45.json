When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (AITA) asking their sister to cover self-harm scars, which caused the sister to get upset. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, now has scars, and the author feels uncomfortable seeing them because it makes them angry and sad. The author mentioned this to the sister, leading to emotional distress.\n\nThe key points to consider are the intent behind the request and the impact it had. The author acknowledges that they\u2019re not in a position to tell their sister what to do, which shows awareness. However, they made a comment that upset the sister. \n\nSelf-harm scars are deeply personal and can be a sensitive topic. The sister might feel that the author's comment is invalidating her past struggles or implying that the scars are something to be hidden. The author's intention was to express their feelings but didn't consider how it might affect the sister. \n\nEven if the author's intention was to express their own discomfort, the way it was communicated might have been careless. The sister's emotional response indicates that the comment triggered painful memories or feelings of shame. \n\nThe author is asking if they're being selfish, which they recognize. But the main issue is whether they overstepped by bringing up the scars. It's important to respect the sister's boundaries and her journey in dealing with her past. \n\nIn relationships, especially among family, communication is key. The author might have a right to express their feelings, but they need to do so without making the sister feel judged. The sister has the right to her body and how she presents it, which the author didn't consider when making the comment.\n\nSo, even though the author's intent wasn't malicious, the act of commenting on the scars without considering the sister's perspective likely caused harm. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions, while coming from a place of emotion, disregarded the sister's feelings and boundaries.\n"
