When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister having self-harm scars from being bullied, and the author is upset seeing them, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author isn't telling her sister what to do but just mentioned seeing the scars, which upset the sister. The author is feeling sad and angry about the past bullying, which is understandable. However, the sister might feel that bringing up the scars is intrusive or retraumatizing.\n\nThe key points here are the intention and the impact. The author's intention was to express their feelings, not to criticize the sister. But the sister's reaction shows that the mention was hurtful. The author is struggling with their own emotions and wants to support their sister but doesn't want to come across as selfish or judgmental.\n\nNow, considering boundaries and empathy. The author should acknowledge their sister's feelings and maybe find another way to cope with their own emotions without bringing up the scars. However, the author isn't forcing the sister to cover them; they just made an offhand comment. The sister's strong reaction suggests that the topic is sensitive.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They aren't in the wrong for having feelings, but they might not have handled it correctly. However, since they didn't make a demand or criticize her actions, just mentioned noticing the scars, which upset the sister. The author is now feeling guilty and wants to know if they're wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was harmful. The comment itself might not be malicious, but the sister felt hurt. The author needs to apologize and understand the sister's perspective. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not, because they didn't intend to harm. However, the act of bringing up the scars could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's intention was to express their feelings, not to criticize. But they should have considered how it might affect their sister. However, the question is about being in the wrong, and since the author didn't act maliciously, maybe they aren't wrong. But I need to check if the act of mentioning the scars without being asked is crossing a line. It's possible that the sister prefers not to talk about them, so the author's mention was intrusive. In that case, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's boundaries. But the sister didn't explicitly say not to mention them. It's a tricky situation.\n\nI think the answer is B, but I'm a bit conflicted. The author didn't do it to hurt but ended up causing pain. They need to be more sensitive, but they aren't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
