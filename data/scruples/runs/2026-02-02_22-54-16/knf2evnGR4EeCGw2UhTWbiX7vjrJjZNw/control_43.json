When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that their sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied, and they're upset by seeing them. The sister is older, living at home now, and the author mentioned the scars, which upset the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. Self-harm is a serious issue, and scars can be a sensitive topic for someone who went through that. The sister might feel embarrassed, vulnerable, or triggered by the scars. The author mentioned the scars, which led to the sister crying. That suggests that bringing it up was hurtful, even if the author's intention was to express discomfort.\n\nNow, the author's reasoning: they feel sad and angry when they see the scars because of the bullying their sister experienced. They admit it's selfish but say it's affecting their relationship. But how does that hold up? The key here is consent and autonomy. The sister's body is hers to choose how to present. The author isn't in a position to dictate her appearance, even if their intention is to protect or help.\n\nThe sister might want to cover the scars for various reasons\u2014self-esteem, privacy, or to protect herself from past trauma. The author's reaction could make the sister feel like her scars are a problem for others, not hers. That's a common issue in cases of self-harm; the person might already feel shame, and others' reactions can amplify that.\n\nThe author also acknowledges they're not in the right position to tell her what to do, which is good. However, bringing up the topic in a casual way might not be the best approach. It's possible the author didn't consider how it would make the sister feel. Even if they meant to be supportive, the way it was brought up caused upset. The sister's emotional reaction indicates that the author's words were hurtful.\n\nBut the author is also dealing with their own emotions. They feel sad and angry, which is understandable given the sister's history. The challenge is balancing their feelings with respecting the sister's autonomy. The author might need to find a way to support their sister without focusing on the physical scars, perhaps by addressing their own emotional response through other means like talking to a therapist.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's actions (mentioning the scars) led to emotional distress in the sister. Even if their intent was to express their feelings, the impact was negative. The author should have considered the sister's feelings more carefully and maybe found another way to express their own emotions without bringing up the scars. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's boundaries and not considering the emotional impact of their words.\n"
