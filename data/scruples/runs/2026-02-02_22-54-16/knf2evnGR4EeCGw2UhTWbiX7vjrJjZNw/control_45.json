When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying. The author is upset seeing them and mentioned it once, which made the sister cry. Now they're worried they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's feelings. Self-harm scars are often sensitive, and the sister might not want them to be a topic of discussion. The author brings up their own feelings about the scars making them sad, which is valid, but they also acknowledge that it's not about them. However, bringing up the scars might make the sister feel judged or uncomfortable, especially since she's already been through a lot.\n\nThe author did mention it casually, but the sister's reaction was strong. That suggests that even a casual mention could be triggering or hurtful. The author is trying to support their sister by wanting to protect their own emotional state, but they might not realize the impact their words have. It's a delicate balance between respecting the sister's autonomy and expressing their own feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't demanding the sister to cover up; they just mentioned seeing the scars. But maybe the way it was said or the underlying intent (to make the sister cover up) could be misinterpreted. The key here is whether the author has the right to make that request. Since the author isn't the one with the scars, their feelings are valid, but the sister's feelings and her right to her own body might take precedence.\n\nAlso, the author's sister has made a lot of progress, so the presence of scars is a reminder of past trauma. The author's mention might unintentionally reopen wounds. The author's approach might not be the best way to handle their own emotions without overstepping. It's possible the author should focus on their own coping mechanisms rather than asking the sister to change her behavior.\n\nIn summary, while the author's feelings are understandable, they might be in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own emotional needs over their sister's comfort and autonomy. It's not about right or wrong in a black-and-white sense, but the action did cause harm, so the author should take responsibility and find a better way to support both themselves and their sister.\n"
