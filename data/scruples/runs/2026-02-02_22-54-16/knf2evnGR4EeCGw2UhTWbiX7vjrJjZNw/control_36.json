When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The situation involves the sister having visible scars from past self-harm, which the author finds upsetting because it reminds them of the bullying their sister endured. The author mentioned it casually, and the sister was upset by that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has a history of self-harm and is now recovering. The author, who hasn't experienced this, is feeling sad and angry when they see the scars. They tried to bring it up, but it caused the sister to cry, leading the author to feel guilty. \n\nThe key points are: the author's intention was to express discomfort but in a way that might have been invalidating. The sister's reaction shows that the comment hurt her, even if it was meant to be a casual mention. The author acknowledges their own selfishness and the impact on their relationship.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, for someone recovering from self-harm, visible scars can be a sensitive topic. The sister might feel self-conscious or retraumatized by reminders. The author's comment, even if well-intentioned, might have made the sister feel like her past is a burden or that her recovery isn't accepted. \n\nThe author's main issue is that they feel upset by the scars, but they don't have the right to dictate how someone should present their body, especially regarding past trauma. The sister's autonomy and emotional state are crucial here. The fact that the sister was upset by the mention suggests that the author's approach was not supportive.\n\nHowever, the author did express concern for their sister's well-being and is seeking advice, showing they care. But the wrong lies in how the concern was communicated. The right approach would be to support the sister and respect her boundaries, rather than asking her to cover the scars. The author needs to focus on their own emotional response and find ways to cope without imposing on the sister.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because they acted out of their own discomfort without considering the sister's feelings and history, leading to a hurtful outcome.\n"
