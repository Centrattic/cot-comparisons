When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying. The author is upset seeing the scars because it makes them angry about the bullying and sad, and mentioning it upset the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't in a position to tell their sister what to do, as they haven't experienced self-harm. The sister has overcome a lot and the author acknowledges that. However, the author's feelings are valid but might be causing unintentional harm. The sister got upset when the author mentioned the scars, which indicates that the comment was hurtful.\n\nThe key points are: the author's intention was to express discomfort, but the way they approached it upset the sister. The sister's autonomy is important\u2014she has the right to choose how she presents herself. The author's reaction might be out of care, but they need to respect the sister's boundaries and feelings. Even if the author's intention wasn't to be selfish, the impact matters. The author might not be wrong for having feelings, but their approach could be inappropriate. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they imposed their feelings on the sister, affecting their relationship negatively. Alternatively, if the author is not in the wrong because they expressed their feelings casually, but maybe they should have found a better way. Hmm. But the sister's reaction shows that the approach was hurtful. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the sister's perspective and the emotional impact of their words.\n"
