When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister had a history of self-harm due to bullying, and now has visible scars. The author, who's younger and hasn't experienced self-harm, says the scars upset them because they trigger anger about the past bullying. They mentioned the scars casually once, and the sister got upset and cried. Now, the author feels bad and is questioning their actions.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention and the sister's reaction. The author didn't tell the sister to hide the scars to be cruel, but because it's affecting their own emotions. However, the sister's scars are a part of her body and her history, and asking her to cover them might be perceived as a request to hide her past or her healing journey. Even if well-meaning, this could be seen as invalidating her experience. \n\nSelf-harm scars can be sensitive. People might feel that others are either prying (like asking about them) or trying to erase them (by asking to cover up). The author's approach was to casually mention they could see the scars, which might have been a way to suggest covering them without directly telling her to. Still, the sister was hurt by it. \n\nThe author should consider that the sister might not want to be reminded of the pain, or might feel that the scars are a part of her strength and recovery. It's important to respect her autonomy over her body. The author's feelings are valid, but the sister's emotional response and boundaries take precedence here. \n\nThe parents didn't notice the self-harm, so the author might not be the best person to be commenting on the scars. The sister might also feel that the author is overstepping, especially since the author isn't in the same position of having experienced self-harm. \n\nThere's no way the author can know the sister's feelings about the scars unless she communicates them. The sister's reaction indicates that the request was hurtful. The author should focus on supporting the sister rather than making her feel she needs to hide her past. \n\nIn terms of being unreasonable, the author is prioritizing their own discomfort over the sister's well-being and personal choice. That's a common issue in AITA situations where one person's sensitivity conflicts with another's. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the sister's reaction shows that the author's request was not considerate of her feelings and boundaries. The author should have approached it differently, maybe by expressing their feelings more empathetically or seeking advice on how to support their sister without making her feel judged.\n"
