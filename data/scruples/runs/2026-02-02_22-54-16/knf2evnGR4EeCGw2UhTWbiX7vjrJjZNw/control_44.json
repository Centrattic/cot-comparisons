When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister to cover self-harm scars.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying. The parents took her to therapy, and she's improving. The author feels upset seeing the scars because it reminds them of the bullying and makes them angry. They mentioned the scars, and the sister got upset. The author is now worried about their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points: The author is not in a position to tell the sister what to do, as the sister's autonomy is important. Self-harm is a sensitive issue. The author expressed their feelings, which might have been unintentionally hurtful. But they also didn't mean to be critical, just to address their own emotional reaction.\n\nHowever, the sister is the one who experienced trauma. The author's reaction might be well-intentioned but could come across as invalidating. The sister's feelings were hurt, so maybe the author should have handled it differently. But is that being in the wrong? It depends on intent and understanding. The author tried to explain their feelings without judgment, but the sister's reaction shows that it was painful. The author might not be entirely wrong, but they could have been more careful in how they approached the topic. The answer might lean towards A (wrong) because they should have considered the sister's feelings more and found another way to cope with their own upset without bringing it up. Or maybe B (not wrong) because they were honest about their feelings. Hmm.\n"
