When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister is older, left university, and living at home. The author is upset seeing the scars because they remind them of the bullying and make them angry. They mentioned it casually, and the sister got upset and cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the family is aware since they took her to therapy. The author is not in a position to judge, as they haven't experienced self-harm. The key points are the sister's autonomy over her body and the author's emotional reaction.\n\nThe author's intention might be concern, but the sister might have valid reasons for not covering the scars. Maybe she's comfortable with them, or it's part of her healing process. The author's reaction caused emotional distress, which is a negative outcome. However, the author is struggling with their feelings and wants to understand if their request was appropriate.\n\nThe sister's reaction (crying) indicates that the request was hurtful. The author might not realize that even though their intent was to avoid seeing the scars, the sister might feel judged or stigmatized. The author's approach was casual, but the sister found it upsetting. The author's right to express their feelings needs to be balanced against the sister's right to autonomy over her body and decisions about her appearance.\n\nIn such cases, the wrong usually lies in not respecting someone's autonomy, especially when it's about their physical appearance. The author's focus is on their own discomfort rather than the sister's well-being. The sister's needs and comfort should take precedence. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for making the request, as it disregards the sister's autonomy and caused her emotional pain.\n"
