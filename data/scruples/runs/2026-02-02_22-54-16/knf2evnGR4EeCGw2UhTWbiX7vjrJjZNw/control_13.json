When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The sister has self-harm scars, and the author mentioned them, which upset the sister.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they wanted to express discomfort but didn't want to be judgmental. They mentioned it casually, but it caused emotional distress. The sister is older and has a history of self-harm due to bullying. The author is struggling with their feelings but acknowledges it's not about them.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective: the scars are part of her past, and she might have chosen not to cover them for personal reasons. The author's comment might have triggered her, especially if she's sensitive about it. Even if well-intentioned, bringing up the scars without prior discussion could be seen as invasive or invalidating.\n\nThe author admits they might be selfish and not in the right position to comment. The sister's reaction (crying) indicates that the conversation wasn't handled well. The key here is that the author didn't ask the sister's opinion on the matter but brought it up themselves. The sister might need space to discuss her scars if and when she's ready. The author's approach might have been too direct without considering her emotional state.\n\nHowever, the author's concern stems from a place of caring. They felt sad and wanted to address it but didn't know the right way. The problem is the method rather than the intent. But in similar situations, respecting the other person's boundaries is crucial. The author should have focused on their own feelings without making the sister feel judged or pressured.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they brought up the topic in a way that caused distress without considering the sister's current comfort level. Even with good intentions, the approach was inappropriate. The sister's autonomy and emotional well-being should take precedence, and the author overstepped by mentioning the scars.\n"
