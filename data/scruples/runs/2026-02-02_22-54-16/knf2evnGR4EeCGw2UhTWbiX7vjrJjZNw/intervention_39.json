When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister having self-harm scars, and the author feeling upset about seeing them. The author mentioned this to the sister, who got upset and cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't self-harming and doesn't have experience with depression. They mention not being in the right position to tell their sister what to do, which shows some awareness of the sister's autonomy and trauma. The author's intent was to express their feelings, but it came out as a comment about the scars, which might have been triggering for the sister.\n\nThe sister's reaction is a key point. The author's sister got very upset, indicating that the comment might have reopened old wounds or made her feel judged. Even if the author's intention was to express their own distress, the sister might have felt embarrassed or criticized. The author acknowledges their own potential selfishness here, which is important.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author tried to communicate their feelings but didn't frame it as a request or a concern for their sister's well-being. Instead, they brought up the visibility of the scars directly, which could be perceived as a demand or a negative reaction. The sister's emotional response suggests that the way it was communicated was hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author's intention wasn't to criticize their sister's appearance but to express their own emotional reaction to the scars. They also apologized and felt bad about it, showing remorse. It's a complex situation where both parties might have valid feelings but need to communicate more carefully.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action was a mistake in how they approached the topic. They might not be entirely in the wrong because their intention was to share their feelings, but the method was flawed. However, the sister has the right to feel upset if the comment made her feel uncomfortable. So, there's a balance here between the author's feelings and the sister's feelings.\n\nThe key is that the author should have approached it differently, perhaps expressing their own feelings without focusing on the scars themselves. Since the author did cause distress, even if unintentionally, they might be in the wrong for not considering the sister's perspective beforehand. But it's a nuanced case where both sides have valid points.\n"
