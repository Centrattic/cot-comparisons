When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister had a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the author is upset seeing the scars. The author mentioned it once, and the sister got upset.\n\nThe key points here: The author didn't confront the sister about the self-harm itself but about the visibility of the scars. The sister has moved on, is in therapy, and the scars are a part of her past. The author is feeling sad and angry, which is affecting their relationship.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. The sister's autonomy is important. She has the right to decide how she presents her body, especially since the self-harm is in the past. The author's intention might be to avoid the distress it causes them, but they shouldn't impose their feelings on the sister. The sister's comfort and privacy are her own to manage.\n\nAlso, the author approached it in a casual way, which might not have been the best approach. However, the main issue is whether the request itself is wrong. Since the sister has the right to choose, the author's request could be seen as overstepping, even if well-intentioned. The sister's negative reaction suggests that the request was hurtful, possibly because it reminded her of her past trauma or made her feel judged.\n\nSo, the author's action, while coming from a place of caring, might be inconsiderate of the sister's current feelings and autonomy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
