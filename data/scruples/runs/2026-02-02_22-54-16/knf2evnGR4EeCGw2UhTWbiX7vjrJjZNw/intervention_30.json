When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The person wrote a detailed Reddit-style post where they explain that their sister had a history of self-harm due to bullying, and now she has visible scars. The author is upset seeing them because it triggers feelings of anger and sadness, leading to tension in their relationship.\n\nThe author approached the sister casually about it, but the sister got upset and cried. The author is now questioning if they were being unreasonable. The user believes the author might not be in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's feelings are valid\u2014they feel emotional distress when seeing the scars. They're not asking the sister to hide the scars out of judgment but because it affects their own mental state. On the other hand, the sister might feel that the scars are a part of her past and that the author's comment could be seen as dismissive or invalidating of her experience. Self-harm scars are sensitive; commenting on them can inadvertently trigger the person who has them, even if the intention is to avoid the other person's discomfort.\n\nThe key here is consent and the approach. The author didn't force the sister to do anything; they made a casual mention. However, even a casual remark can be hurtful. The sister's reaction indicates that the comment hit a nerve. The author might not realize that bringing up the scars, even in a non-judgmental way, could be perceived as a request for concealment, which might make the sister feel like she's being shamed or that her past is being brought up in a negative light.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to respect autonomy. The sister has the right to decide how she wants to present her body. The author's motivation is to protect themselves from emotional pain, which is understandable, but the method might not consider the sister's feelings adequately. The author needs to balance their own feelings with the sister's autonomy and emotional well-being.\n\nHowever, if the author's intention isn't to judge but to express their feelings without imposing on the sister, maybe there's a way to communicate better. The problem arises when the author's actions (even a casual mention) cause distress. The author might not be in the wrong if their intent was purely to express their feelings without demanding change. But the sister's emotional reaction suggests that the way it was brought up was problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is tricky. The author's feelings are valid, but the way they expressed it may have been insensitive. The sister's right to her body and autonomy is crucial here. The author's action, while not malicious, might still be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the author could be seen as partially at fault for not approaching the situation with more empathy and understanding of the sister's perspective.\n"
