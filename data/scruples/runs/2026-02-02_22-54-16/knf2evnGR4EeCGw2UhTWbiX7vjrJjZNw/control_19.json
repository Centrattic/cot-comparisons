When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the author finds the scars upsetting, leading to feelings of anger and sadness. \n\nFirst, the key points: The sister has overcome a lot, has therapy, and the scars are still visible. The author mentioned seeing the scars, which upset the sister. The author is struggling with their emotions but recognizes they shouldn't impose their feelings on their sister.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's intention might be to avoid being reminded of the sister's past trauma, but they have to respect the sister's autonomy. The sister might feel that the author is invalidating her experience or implying the scars should be hidden, which can be triggering. The author's approach was direct and led to the sister crying, which suggests it was hurtful. \n\nIn such situations, the person with the wound (the sister) has the right to decide how to present herself. The author's reaction, while stemming from empathy, might be projecting their own discomfort onto the sister. It's important to validate the sister's feelings and offer support rather than making demands. The author should probably focus on managing their own emotions and seeking ways to support their sister without causing her distress. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the sister's feelings and autonomy, and their approach was inappropriate.\n"
