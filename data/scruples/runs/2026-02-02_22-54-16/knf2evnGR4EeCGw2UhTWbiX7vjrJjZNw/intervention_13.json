When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm, which the author finds upsetting because it reminds them of the bullying. The author mentioned the scars once, and the sister got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is older, has a history of self-harm, and the author is younger. The author's main issue is that seeing the scars makes them feel sad and angry. They acknowledge their own potential selfishness and the sister's right to her body. The sister reacted negatively to the comment.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author overstep by bringing up the scars? The author didn't tell the sister to cover them directly but mentioned seeing them once. The sister's reaction was emotional, which the author regrets. The question is whether the author had the right to express their feelings in that situation.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, someone with a history of self-harm might have triggers or feelings about their scars. They might not want to be reminded of their past, especially by family members. The author's intention was to express discomfort, but it's possible that the sister felt judged or criticized, even if unintentionally.\n\nHowever, the author did frame their comment as a casual mention, not a demand. The sister's upset reaction might stem from feeling that her past is being highlighted again, which could be painful. The author is dealing with their own emotional response but needs to balance that with respecting their sister's autonomy and feelings.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they approached it respectfully and without judgment, but the sister still felt hurt, maybe not entirely the author's fault. But if the comment was made without considering the sister's feelings, then perhaps they did overstep. The author acknowledges their possible selfishness, which shows self-awareness. The sister's right to her body and past experiences is a strong point here. So, while the author's intention was to share their feelings, the sister's emotional response suggests the comment was received negatively. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating the sister's sensitivity around the topic.\n"
