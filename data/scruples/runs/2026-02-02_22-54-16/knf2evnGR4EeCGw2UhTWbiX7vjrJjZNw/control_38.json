When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and she's now recovered with therapy. The scars are visible, and the author feels upset seeing them because it reminds them of the bullying. The author mentions they didn't tell the sister to stop self-harming but just wanted her to cover the scars. However, when they mentioned it, the sister got upset and cried.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is dealing with their own emotional reaction\u2014feeling sad and angry when they see the scars. They admit it's not about them, but it's affecting their relationship. The sister might feel like her past trauma is being brought up again, or that her autonomy is being invaded. The author didn't explicitly ask her to cover them, just mentioned noticing them. But the sister's reaction suggests that the comment was hurtful.\n\nSelf-harm scars are sensitive. Even if they're old, bringing up the topic can reopen wounds. The author's intention might be to avoid triggering their own sadness, but they didn't consider how the sister would feel. The sister might feel judged or that her recovery is being invalidated. The author's approach was probably too direct or not framed with enough empathy. Instead of focusing on their own feelings, they might have approached it differently, like supporting the sister more or seeking ways to cope themselves without making the sister feel uncomfortable.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? They did express their feelings in a way that hurt the sister. Even if their intentions were good, the method might have been inappropriate. They need to respect the sister's autonomy and her right to choose how she presents herself. The sister's trauma is her own, and the author's reaction, while understandable, shouldn't dictate her actions. The author's mistake was not handling the conversation with more care and sensitivity, leading to a negative reaction.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't approach the situation with enough empathy and understanding of their sister's feelings, leading to hurt.\n"
