When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister having self-harm scars from being bullied, and the author feels upset seeing them, which affects their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The sister is older, has a history of self-harm, and now has visible scars. The author mentions these scars make them feel angry and sad because of the bullying. They tried to mention it casually, but the sister got upset and cried. The author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to express discomfort without imposing, but the sister reacted negatively. The question is whether the author is wrong. From a psychological standpoint, self-harm scars are sensitive. The sister might be self-conscious about her scars, especially if they're reminders of past trauma. The author's reaction could be seen as not considering the sister's feelings, even if they didn't mean to. \n\nThe author says they know it's not about them, but their feelings are affecting their ability to be around the sister. However, the sister might feel that the author is judging her or bringing up the past, which could be triggering. The sister's emotional response suggests that bringing up the scars was hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author admits they can't imagine the sister's perspective and aren't in the right position to tell her what to do. But by mentioning the scars, they might have inadvertently made the sister feel criticized. The key here is that the sister's well-being and comfort should take precedence, even if the author is trying to be supportive. \n\nIn such cases, the right approach might be to talk about their own feelings without focusing on the scars. For example, saying they feel sad about the past but trust the sister has moved forward, rather than commenting on the physical evidence. But since the author did comment on it and caused distress, they might be in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they expressed their discomfort in a way that hurt the sister, even if unintentionally.\n"
