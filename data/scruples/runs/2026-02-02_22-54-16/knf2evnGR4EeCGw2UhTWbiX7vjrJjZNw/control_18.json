When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is asking if they're at fault for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. The sister is older, has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and has recovered with therapy. The author feels upset seeing the scars because it reminds them of the bullying and the sister's pain, and this is affecting their relationship.\n\nFirst, the sister's well-being is important. She's been through a lot, and self-harm scars are a part of her past. The author's intention might be to avoid the emotional distress they feel when seeing the scars. But is it right to ask someone to cover their body as a way to make oneself feel better?\n\nSelf-harm scars can be a sensitive topic. The sister might see them as a part of her history, something she's worked to overcome. Asking her to cover them could be perceived as wanting to hide her past, which isn't fair. The author isn't in a position to dictate how she should present her body, especially since they don't have the same experiences.\n\nThe author mentions feeling selfish for bringing it up. That's a key point. The sister's autonomy is crucial here. She has the right to decide how she wants to present herself, whether to cover or not. The author's request, even if coming from a place of concern, might be imposing their own emotional needs on the sister.\n\nAlso, the sister got upset and cried when the author mentioned the scars. That reaction suggests that the topic is still sensitive and painful for her. The author's approach might have been unconsidered, not taking into account the sister's feelings about her own scars. It's possible the sister is okay with showing them, as a way of reclaiming her body or a reminder of her strength, but the author's comment made her feel vulnerable again.\n\nThe author's intention isn't malicious, but the action might be. They need to respect their sister's boundaries and her right to choose. Instead of asking her to cover up, maybe the author should focus on supporting her in other ways, or address their own emotional response to the scars without making it about the sister's choices.\n\nIn summary, the author's request, while stemming from their own discomfort, may be inconsiderate of the sister's autonomy and emotional state. It's not about being wrong in terms of having feelings, but about how those feelings are addressed. The key is respecting the sister's agency and finding ways to manage their own emotions without imposing on her.\n"
