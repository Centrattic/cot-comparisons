When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is upset because their older sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied at 17. The sister is now home after university, and the author sees the scars often, which makes them feel angry and sad. They mentioned it once, and the sister got upset and cried. Now the author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's emotional response versus their sister's feelings. The author isn't telling the sister to hide the scars for their sake, but they're feeling that it's affecting their relationship. The sister had a traumatic experience, and the author's comment upset her.\n\nBut self-harm scars are a physical reminder of past pain. The sister might have worked hard to overcome that, and the author's reaction might trigger her. The author's intention wasn't to hurt, but bringing up the scars in a casual way could be triggering. The sister might feel that the author is invalidating her progress or not respecting her boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't demanding the sister to cover them, just expressing discomfort. But the sister's emotional response suggests it's a sensitive topic. The author might not have considered how their words could affect the sister, even if unintentionally. So maybe the author is in the wrong here because they didn't handle it sensitively, and their approach caused distress. They need to respect the sister's boundaries and find a way to support her without making her feel judged.\n"
