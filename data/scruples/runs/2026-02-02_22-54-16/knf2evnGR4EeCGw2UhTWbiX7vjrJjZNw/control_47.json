When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister has visible scars from past self-harm, which she's come a long way from. The author is upset seeing the scars because it reminds them of the bullying and makes them angry. The author mentioned it casually, and the sister was upset.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author was wrong to bring it up. Let's break it down. The sister is older, so she's an adult. The scars are a result of her past trauma. The author's intention was to ask her to cover them, but maybe the way they brought it up was not the best. The sister got upset, and the author feels bad about it.\n\nConsidering the sister's autonomy, she has the right to choose how she presents her body. The author might not be in the right to dictate that. However, the author is also expressing their own emotional reaction. It's a sensitive situation because it's a family member.\n\nBut the key points are: the author didn't force her, just mentioned it casually. The sister had a strong reaction, which could mean the topic is sensitive. The author's intention might have been to avoid the emotional distress from seeing the scars, but they didn't consider how their words might affect the sister.\n\nIn similar advice contexts, it's often recommended to respect someone's boundaries regarding their body and trauma. Even if the author's intention was to help or reduce their own discomfort, the sister's feelings and autonomy are more important. So the author might be in the wrong for not being mindful of how their comment could hurt or trigger the sister. They should probably focus on managing their own emotional response instead of trying to change the sister's behavior.\n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
