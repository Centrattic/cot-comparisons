When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover her self-harm scars. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying. The author, who's younger, finds the scars upsetting because they make them angry and sad. They mentioned the scars once, which upset the sister, and now they're worried about their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and the sister's reaction. The author didn't tell the sister to cover up, but just mentioned that they could see the scars. However, the sister got upset and cried. The author is conflicted because they don't want to be selfish but are struggling with their emotions.\n\nNow, considering the sister's history, the scars are part of her past trauma. The author might not fully understand the emotional weight those scars carry for the sister. By bringing it up, even casually, the author might have triggered painful memories or feelings of shame for the sister. The sister's reaction suggests that the mention of the scars was a sensitive topic for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid\u2014they're upset because the scars remind them of the bullying their sister endured. But the way they addressed it might not have been the best approach. Instead of mentioning the scars directly, maybe the author should have discussed their feelings with the sister in a more supportive way, focusing on their own emotions without making the sister feel judged.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they didn't act out of malice. However, their approach could have been more empathetic. The sister's well-being is crucial, and the author's intention was to express concern, albeit clumsily. The main issue is that the author didn't consider how their comment might affect the sister. It's about communication and emotional sensitivity here. So, while the author isn't entirely at fault, they could have handled it better. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Given that they acted from a place of concern and didn't force the sister to cover up, the answer might lean towards them not being in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in their approach.\n"
