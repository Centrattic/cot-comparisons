When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong when they asked their sister to cover self-harm scars. The author's sister has scars from past self-harm, and the author feels upset seeing them, leading to emotional distress. The author mentioned it casually, which made the sister cry, and now they're worried about their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the scars are a result of that traumatic experience. The author isn't self-harming but is affected emotionally by seeing the scars. The key points here are the author's intentions and how the sister reacted.\n\nThe author says they mentioned the scars casually. They acknowledge not being in the right position to tell her what to do, which shows some awareness of the sister's autonomy. However, the sister was upset and cried, indicating that the mention was painful for her. Even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, the action still caused distress.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective, scars from self-harm can be a sensitive topic. For someone who has experienced trauma, being reminded of it, even unintentionally, can be triggering. The author might not realize how sensitive the subject is. The sister's reaction (crying) suggests that the mention reopened emotional wounds or made her feel judged.\n\nThe author's motivation is to protect their own emotional well-being because seeing the scars makes them sad and angry. While it's valid to feel that way, the way to address it might not be by bringing up the scars directly. Instead, the author might need to focus on their own coping mechanisms rather than asking the sister to cover them, as the scars are part of her past and she has the right to present herself as she chooses.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't mean to hurt the sister, but their action did cause harm. The problem is that they brought up the subject, which the sister might not want to discuss. The author should have considered the sister's feelings and perhaps approached it differently, like supporting her in other ways rather than focusing on the scars. However, the author's intention was not to be cruel, just to express their own discomfort.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The author's action was well-meaning but misguided. They might not be \"in the wrong\" in a malicious sense, but they did something that hurt their sister. The key is whether the author should have anticipated the sister's sensitivity and found another way to handle their feelings without burdening the sister. The sister has the right to her body and how she chooses to present it. The author's responsibility is to manage their own emotions rather than impose their comfort on the sister.\n\nSo, balancing both perspectives, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their action, even if unintentional, caused emotional harm. However, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, which might be because they see the author's intent as caring and not malicious. The main issue is the approach taken. The author should have been more sensitive to the sister's past trauma and found a different way to address their own feelings without bringing up the scars.\n"
