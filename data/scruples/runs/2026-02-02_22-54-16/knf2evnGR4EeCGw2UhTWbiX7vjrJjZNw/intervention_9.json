When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The situation is that the sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying, and the author feels upset seeing them, even though they know it's not about them. They mentioned it once, and the sister got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author acknowledges they aren't in the right position to tell their sister what to do and admits they're being selfish. But they're also dealing with their own emotional response. The key here is intent. The author didn't mean to be critical but wanted to avoid the distress the scars cause them. However, bringing up the scars, even casually, might have been perceived as judgment or a request to cover them, which can be hurtful. The sister's reaction shows that the comment was distressing for her, possibly making her feel self-conscious again or like her scars are a problem. \n\nThe author's motivation is understandable\u2014they\u2019re struggling with their feelings. But the way they approached it might not have been the best. Maybe they could have handled it differently, like talking to a therapist to manage their own emotions rather than asking the sister to cover up. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author didn't have malicious intent and was trying to communicate their feelings, but the sister still felt hurt, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn such cases, the responsibility isn't just on the person expressing their feelings but also on understanding the other person's perspective. The author might not be in the wrong for having these feelings, but they could be in the wrong for how they addressed them. However, the sister's emotional response is valid too. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they had good intentions, even if the approach was flawed. But I need to check if there's a standard here. Usually, if someone's action, even with good intent, causes harm, there's a case for being in the wrong. But since the author is trying to navigate their own emotions and the sister's history, it's complex. Maybe the right answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because they expressed their feelings in a way that could be handled better, but they had no ill intent. So the answer would be B for No.\n"
