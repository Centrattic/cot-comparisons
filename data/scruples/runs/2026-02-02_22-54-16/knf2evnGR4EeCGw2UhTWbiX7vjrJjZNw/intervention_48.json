When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeling upset by their sister's self-harm scars and bringing it up, which then upset their sister. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying. She's been through therapy and has made progress, but the scars are still visible. The author, who hasn't experienced self-harm, feels sad and angry when seeing the scars, leading them to mention it to their sister. The sister was upset by this, and the author is now questioning if they were wrong to say anything.\n\nThe author acknowledges their own potential selfishness, recognizing that it's not about them. They tried to bring it up casually but it caused emotional distress. Now they're wondering if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, the sister's scars are a sensitive issue. Self-harm is a serious mental health issue, and the scars can be a trigger for the person with the scars or others. The author's intention was likely to express concern or perhaps to discuss the pain their sister went through. However, the way it was brought up might not have considered the sister's current feelings about her scars. Maybe the sister is uncomfortable with the visibility of the scars, or maybe she's trying to move past that part of her life and doesn't want to be reminded of it. The author's mention could have unintentionally reopened old wounds or made the sister feel judged.\n\nIt's important to consider the sister's autonomy. The author has no right to dictate how their sister should present her body. Even with good intentions, the author overstepped by making a request for her to cover the scars. The sister's right to her body and her healing process is paramount. The fact that the sister got upset and started crying shows that the comment was hurtful, regardless of the author's intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their own emotions and the impact the scars have on them. They might be feeling helplessness or anger towards the past trauma inflicted on their sister. However, the key here is that the author's emotional response shouldn't override their sister's needs and comfort. The author needs to find ways to process their feelings without imposing on their sister.\n\nThe sister's reaction suggests that the topic is still sensitive for her. The author might need to apologize and clarify that their intent wasn't to criticize but to express their own pain. They should listen to their sister's perspective and support her without making demands. The author's mistake was in the approach rather than the concern itself. The concern comes from a place of care, but the method of addressing it was inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions might be good, but the action of asking their sister to cover her scars was inappropriate. They should respect their sister's autonomy and focus on supporting her healing in a way that doesn't make her feel pressured. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
