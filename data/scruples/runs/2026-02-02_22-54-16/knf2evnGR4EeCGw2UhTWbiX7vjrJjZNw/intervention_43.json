When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The story is that the sister has scars from past self-harm due to bullying, and the author finds it upsetting to see them, which is affecting their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister is older, has been through therapy, and has come a long way. The author isn't self-harming and doesn't want to tell her what to do. They mentioned the scars casually, and the sister got upset. The author feels upset because seeing the scars makes them angry about the bullying and sad. They mention feeling selfish for bringing it up.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author's request is reasonable. On one hand, the sister's autonomy is important. She might feel that covering her scars is a personal choice, and the author's request could be seen as intrusive, especially if the author isn't in a position to understand her experience. The sister's emotional reaction (crying) suggests that the request hurt her feelings, possibly because she felt judged or criticized.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their own emotional reaction and trying to manage their feelings. They didn't directly tell her to cover them but mentioned seeing them, which led to the sister's distress. The author might not have considered how their comment would affect the sister, even if it was meant as a concern.\n\nI think the key points here are about respect for the sister's autonomy and the way the author approached the issue. The author's intention might be to protect their own emotional well-being, but the method of addressing it might have been inappropriate. The sister's scars are a part of her history, and she might want to keep them visible for various reasons\u2014maybe as a reminder of her strength, or maybe she's comfortable with them now. The author's comment could be seen as invalidating her journey or implying that the scars are something to be hidden.\n\nSo, considering that the author's request could be perceived as pressuring the sister to hide her scars, which might not be respectful of her personal experience and autonomy, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong. However, the author is also dealing with their own emotions, which is valid. But the way they expressed their feelings might not have been the right approach.\n"
