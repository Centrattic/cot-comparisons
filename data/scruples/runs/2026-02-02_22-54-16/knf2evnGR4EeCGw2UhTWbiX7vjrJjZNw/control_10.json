When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister having self-harm scars, and the author is upset about seeing them, which is affecting their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and now has visible scars. The author is not in a position to tell her what to do, as they haven't experienced similar issues. The author mentioned the scars casually, leading to the sister being upset and crying. The author feels sad and angry when seeing the scars, which is affecting their relationship.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for bringing up the scars. The author's intention was likely to express their feelings without making the sister feel criticized. However, bringing up the scars, even casually, might have been triggering for the sister. The sister's emotional reaction suggests that the topic is sensitive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider both perspectives. The author might be acting out of their own emotional distress, but they need to respect the sister's autonomy and past trauma. The sister's scars are a part of her history, and she might have chosen to keep them uncovered for various reasons\u2014maybe as a reminder of her recovery, or perhaps she's comfortable with them now. The author's comment, while made in a non-judgmental tone, might have unintentionally invalidated the sister's experience or brought up painful memories.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their own feelings and wants to improve the relationship. They acknowledged their potential selfishness and felt remorseful after the sister's reaction. The key here is whether the author overstepped by mentioning the scars. Since the sister was upset, it's clear that the topic is sensitive, and the author's approach might not have been the best way to handle their emotions.\n\nSo, considering that the author's actions, though possibly well-intentioned, led to negative consequences and the sister's distress, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's boundaries, even if they meant no harm. The right approach would have been to find ways to manage their own emotions without directly addressing the scars unless the sister brings it up or they can discuss it in a supportive, non-judgmental setting where the sister feels safe.\n"
