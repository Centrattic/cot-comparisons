When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author is a younger sibling who's upset about seeing their older sister's self-harm scars. The sister had a history of bullying and self-harm but has since recovered. The author mentions that the scars affect their emotional state and that bringing it up made the sister cry. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author didn't mean to attack or judge but was overwhelmed by their own emotions. They approached it casually, not to criticize but to express discomfort. However, the sister's reaction was hurtful and emotional. \n\nThe key points are: the author's intent was to express their feelings, not to shame the sister. They acknowledge their own possible selfishness but are struggling with their emotions. The sister has a history of trauma, and the author is trying to navigate their feelings without being invasive.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, in terms of intention, they're not malicious. However, bringing up the scars might have been a sensitive topic. The sister might feel that the scars are a private matter, and the author's mention could reopen old wounds. Even if the author's intention was innocent, the action might still be seen as intrusive. The author should consider the sister's feelings and boundaries. Maybe they should apologize and find a better way to handle their emotions, like addressing their own triggers instead of bringing up the issue. \n\nBut the author isn't in the wrong because they're not trying to hurt. They're struggling with their feelings. However, they did cross a boundary unintentionally. So maybe the answer is a mix. But according to the user's instruction, answer A or B. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others might see it as crossing a line. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, if someone's actions, even with good intentions, hurt another, they might be considered in the wrong. However, if the action was well-meaning but misguided, it's a gray area. Here, the author's action was a mistake but not malicious. So perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong) because their intent wasn't to harm, and they felt bad afterward. The sister's reaction is valid, but the author isn't entirely wrong. They need to work on their approach, but not in the wrong per se.\n"
