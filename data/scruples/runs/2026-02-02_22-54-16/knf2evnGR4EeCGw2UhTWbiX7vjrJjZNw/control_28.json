When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of self-harm due to bullying, and it's stopped now. She's making progress, but the scars are still there. The author feels upset and angry when they see the scars, even though they know they're in no position to tell their sister what to do. They mentioned the scars casually, and the sister got upset and cried. The author is now questioning if they were wrong to bring it up.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author is dealing with their own emotional response (sadness, anger) to their sister's scars. They tried to mention it casually, but it hurt the sister. The sister is in a vulnerable position, having overcome self-harm, and the scars are a part of her past. The author's intention was to express their feelings, but the sister felt criticized or judged, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering empathy and boundaries. The author isn't in therapy themselves and can't fully understand the sister's perspective. By bringing up the scars, even if it's to express their own feelings, it might have come across as blaming the sister for her past trauma. The sister might feel that the author is invalidating her recovery or making her hide parts of herself that are a result of her struggle.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to navigate their own emotions and the impact of seeing the scars. They might be struggling with the trauma of knowing their sister was bullied and self-harmed, which is a natural reaction. However, the way they approached the sister\u2014casually mentioning the scars\u2014might not have been the right approach. Instead of focusing on covering them, maybe the author should address their own feelings in a way that doesn't put pressure on the sister.\n\nSo, the author's intention wasn't to criticize but to express their discomfort, but the method might have been harmful. The sister's reaction shows that their words were hurtful. The author needs to consider how their words affect the sister and find a healthier way to cope with their own emotions without burdening the sister. This seems like a case where the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're dealing with their own emotions, but they could have handled the situation better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since their action (mentioning the scars) caused emotional harm, even if unintentionally, they might be in the wrong for not considering the sister's feelings enough. So, the answer might be A (Yes), but I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again.\n\nThe sister's scars are a part of her healing process. The author's reaction could be seen as prioritizing their own discomfort over the sister's autonomy. The right approach would be for the author to manage their own emotions, maybe seek support for their feelings about the sister's past, rather than asking the sister to cover up. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's boundaries and triggered her by bringing up the scars in a way that made her feel ashamed or criticized. So, Answer A.\n"
