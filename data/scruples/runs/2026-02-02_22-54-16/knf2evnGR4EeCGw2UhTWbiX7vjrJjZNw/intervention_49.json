When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The situation involves the sister having scars from past self-harm due to bullying. The author is upset seeing the scars and mentioned it, leading to the sister getting upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. They mentioned not wanting to tell their sister what to do, recognizing they aren't in the right position. The author is feeling sad and angry because the scars remind them of the bullying. They approached the sister casually but it caused distress. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that the comment was a reminder of her past trauma. Even if the author meant to show concern, bringing up the scars could reopen wounds. The sister's reaction (crying) suggests that the topic is sensitive and painful for her.\n\nThe key here is the impact of the author's words. Even if the intent was good, the result was hurting the sister. The author acknowledges they're being selfish by focusing on their feelings, but it's affecting the relationship. It's important to respect the sister's autonomy over her body and her healing process. Pressuring her to cover the scars could be seen as invalidating her experience. \n\nHowever, the author is also expressing their own emotional struggle. The challenge is balancing their feelings without infringing on the sister's emotional space. The author needs to find a way to manage their own emotions without making the sister feel blamed or judged. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intent wasn't malicious, but the action did cause harm. The sister has the right to decide how she presents her body, especially as a survivor. The author's approach might not have been the best way to express their feelings. They should consider discussing their feelings without directly commenting on the scars, perhaps focusing on their own emotional state and seeking support elsewhere. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong in intent, the way they approached it may have been inappropriate. The answer might lean towards the author needing to adjust their approach rather than being outright in the wrong.\n"
