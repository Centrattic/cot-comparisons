When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied at 17. The parents eventually noticed and she got therapy, and the self-harm stopped. Now the sister lives at home, and the author is upset seeing her scars, which makes him feel angry and sad. He mentioned it once, and she got upset and cried. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, the author isn't telling his sister to cover up the scars to hurt her or make her feel bad. He's struggling with his emotions when he sees them. He approached her casually, but she was upset. He feels guilty. His main issue is that it's affecting his relationship with her. \n\nBut wait, the sister's scars are part of her body and her past. Even though she's come a long way, those scars are a physical reminder of her trauma. The author isn't in the right to ask her to cover them up because he's uncomfortable, right? The sister might feel that her autonomy is being invaded if someone else is dictating how she should present her body. Even if the author's intentions are good, the act of asking her to cover them could be seen as minimizing her experience or making it about him rather than her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing his feelings honestly. He didn't confront her harshly but did bring it up casually. However, the key point is that he's projecting his own emotional response onto her. He's upset about the bullying and the scars, but the sister might not be comfortable with discussing it, especially if it's bringing up painful memories for her. The fact that she was upset and cried suggests that bringing it up hurt her feelings, even if he meant to be supportive.\n\nThe author's problem is that he's trying to address his own emotional distress by involving the sister, which might not be the right approach. The sister's scars are part of her healing journey, and she might feel that covering them is a personal choice she doesn't want to make. The author's request, though well-intentioned, might be seen as imposing his own discomfort on her, which isn't fair. The author should focus on managing his own emotions rather than expecting her to change her behavior to accommodate his feelings.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because his request is based on his own emotional needs rather than respecting the sister's autonomy and her choice to show her scars. Even if he's trying to be supportive, the way he approached it caused her distress. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
