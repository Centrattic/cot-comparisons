When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is talking about their sister, who is four years older and currently living at home after university. The sister used to self-harm due to bullying at 17, and while she's in therapy and has come a long way, she still has visible scars. The author is upset when they see these scars because it makes them angry and sad, thinking about the bullying. They mentioned it once in a casual way, which made the sister cry, and now they're wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She has a history of self-harm, which is a serious issue. The scars are a part of her past, and she might be sensitive about them. The author mentions that the sister is doing better now, but the scars are still there. The author's intention was probably to express their feelings but in a way that caused emotional pain to their sister. \n\nThe key points here are about empathy and boundaries. The author is struggling with their own emotions seeing the scars, but the sister might not want to cover them for various reasons\u2014maybe they're a reminder of her strength, or she's not ready to talk about it, or she feels it's her personal choice to show them. The author's approach was casual, but it wasn't the right time or way to address the issue. The sister's reaction shows that the mention of the scars was a trigger or a sensitive topic for her.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in terms of their feelings being valid (they have the right to feel sad and upset about their sister's past), but how they expressed it was probably not appropriate. The sister has the right to her own boundaries, and the author should have approached the situation more carefully, perhaps by seeking to understand the sister's feelings first rather than focusing on their own discomfort.\n\nAlso, the author admitted they're being selfish by saying it's not about them, which shows some self-awareness. However, the way they brought up the issue caused harm. The sister's distress indicates that the author overstepped, even if their intentions were to express concern.\n\nIn terms of advice, the author should probably apologize to their sister and respect her boundaries. They might need to find other ways to cope with their feelings without making the sister feel judged. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because their approach was unconsidered and hurtful, even if their feelings are understandable.\n"
