When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a sibling where the sister has scars from self-harm. The author is upset seeing the scars because it makes them angry about the bullying and sad. They mentioned it once and the sister got upset and cried. The author is now wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister has a history of self-harm, which is a serious issue. The author is trying to express their feelings but might not have realized how sensitive the topic is. The sister's reaction is strong, which suggests that the scars are a painful reminder for her. \n\nThe author mentions they don't want to tell the sister what to do, which is good because it shows they respect her autonomy. However, bringing up the scars even casually might have been a trigger for the sister. The author's intention might have been to express their own discomfort, but the sister's emotional response indicates that it's a sensitive topic for her. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. The author is not in a position to demand the sister cover her scars, especially since the sister's well-being is more important. The author's words, even if well-intentioned, caused distress. The sister's right to her own body and her healing process is crucial. The author should focus on managing their own emotions rather than making the sister change her behavior. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong in terms of having feelings, but the way they expressed it was unhelpful and hurtful. The problem is more about the sister's needs and boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they expressed their feelings in a way that negatively impacted their sister without considering her perspective.\n"
