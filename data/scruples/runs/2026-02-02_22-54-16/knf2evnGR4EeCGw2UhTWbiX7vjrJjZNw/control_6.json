When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister having self-harm scars from when she was bullied. The author is upset seeing the scars and mentioned it, causing the sister to cry. The author now feels bad and is asking if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. Self-harm scars are a sensitive topic. The sister went through a lot, including bullying and therapy. She might feel that her scars are part of her past, and she's come a long way. Covering them might be a personal choice, and others shouldn't dictate that unless there's a direct issue.\n\nThe author's intention was to express discomfort, but doing so in a casual way might not consider the sister's feelings. The sister's reaction shows that the topic is still sensitive for her. The author might not realize that bringing up the scars could trigger negative emotions or make the sister feel judged. Even if the author isn't self-harming, they might not understand the emotional weight of the scars.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about their feelings and isn't trying to belittle the sister's experience. They acknowledge their own potential selfishness and are seeking advice to fix the situation. The key here is whether the author overstepped by commenting on the scars. Since the sister got upset and it's affecting their relationship, the author's comment was probably not the right approach. They should have considered the sister's feelings and perhaps found a better way to address their own discomfort without making the sister feel criticized.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but they are in the wrong for how they expressed it. The sister has the right to choose how she presents herself, and the author's casual mention might have been unintentionally hurtful. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation with enough sensitivity.\n"
