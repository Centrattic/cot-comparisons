When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying and has made progress. The author feels upset seeing the scars and mentioned it once, which upset the sister.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions: they care about their sister and are emotional about her past. But they didn't have the right to make a demand. They admitted they're not self-harming and can't imagine her experience, which shows they don't have the authority to tell her what to do. \n\nThe sister is now in recovery, and the scars are part of her history. Covering them isn't something she's obligated to do. The author's comment was casual but caused emotional pain. The key point is that the author's action, even if coming from a place of concern, overstepped. They should have focused on supporting their sister rather than making her change her appearance.\n\nAlso, the relationship is affected now because the sister is upset. The author needs to apologize and respect her boundaries. So the answer is A; the author is in the wrong.\n"
