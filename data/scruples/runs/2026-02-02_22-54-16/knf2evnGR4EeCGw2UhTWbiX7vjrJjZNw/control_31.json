When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe sister has self-harm scars from when she was bullied. The author is upset seeing them because it makes them angry about the bullying. They mentioned the scars casually, which upset their sister. The question is whether the author is wrong for bringing it up.\n\nFirst, the sister has the right to her body. The author isn't in a position to tell her what to cover. However, the author is also dealing with their own emotional response. The key here is how the author approached it. They said they \"casually mentioned\" seeing the scars, which might not be the best approach. The sister got upset and cried, so the author's words had a negative impact. \n\nEven though the author's intention wasn't to criticize, just to express their feelings, the way they did it might have been insensitive. The sister might feel that her past trauma is being brought up, and she might not want to be reminded of that. The author should have considered how the sister would feel and maybe found a more supportive way to address their own feelings without making the sister feel judged. \n\nThe author also acknowledges they're being selfish, which shows some self-awareness. But the fact that it's affecting their relationship suggests that the approach was problematic. So, while the author isn't malicious, their approach was wrong because they didn't handle the sister's feelings appropriately. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
