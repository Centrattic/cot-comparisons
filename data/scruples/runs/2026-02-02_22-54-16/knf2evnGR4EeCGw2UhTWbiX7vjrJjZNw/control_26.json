When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister's self-harm scars and the author's reaction to them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The author's sister had a history of self-harm due to bullying, which was addressed with therapy and has stopped. The sister now has visible scars. The author is upset when they see the scars because it makes them angry and sad about the bullying. They mentioned the scars once, which upset the sister, leading to crying. The author feels guilty and is questioning if they were wrong to bring it up.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The sister's scars are a part of her past, and she may have chosen to keep them visible as a personal choice. The author's intention might have been to express discomfort, but bringing it up can be triggering for the sister. Even if the author's intention wasn't to harm, the action did cause emotional distress. The sister's reaction (crying) indicates that the comment was hurtful. \n\nThe author admits they are not in the position to tell their sister what to do and acknowledges their own selfishness in feeling upset. However, by bringing up the scars, they may have violated the sister's boundaries. The sister might feel that her choice to show or hide the scars is her own, and the author overstepped by commenting on it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their own emotional response, which is valid. But in this case, the sister's autonomy and feelings take precedence. The author's comment, even if well-intentioned, was not their place to make. It's important to respect the sister's decisions about her body, especially given her history of trauma. The fact that the sister got upset shows that the author's words had a negative impact. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for bringing up the scars in a way that caused the sister distress, regardless of their intent. The answer should be A.\n"
