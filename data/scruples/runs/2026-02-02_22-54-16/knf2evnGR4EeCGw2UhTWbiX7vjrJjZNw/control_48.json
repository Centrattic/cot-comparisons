When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The key points here are about the sister's self-harm scars and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their sister has scars from self-harm due to bullying in the past. The author feels upset and angry when seeing the scars, which is affecting their relationship. They tried to mention it casually, but the sister got upset and cried. The author is now questioning if they're being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to ask the sister to cover the scars. The sister's mental health history is important here. Self-harm scars are a sensitive topic because they relate to trauma and recovery. The author's sister might have worked hard to overcome this, and the scars might be a part of her journey. Publicly covering them could be about protecting the author's feelings, but the sister might feel that her autonomy is being challenged.\n\nThe author's intention was to avoid being upset, but bringing it up directly might have invalidated the sister's experience. The sister's reaction indicates that the topic is still sensitive. The author should consider that the scars are part of her sister's story and that she has the right to decide how she presents herself. The author might be projecting their own discomfort rather than respecting the sister's boundaries and autonomy. \n\nAdditionally, the author acknowledges they aren't in the right position to tell the sister what to do, which shows some self-awareness. However, the act of bringing it up, even casually, might still be intrusive. The sister's emotional response suggests that the author's approach was not appropriate. The author's focus on their own feelings (\"it's not about me\") could be seen as selfish, as the sister's well-being and autonomy are central here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, the way they addressed the issue might have been inappropriate. The sister's right to her own body and her past experiences take precedence. The author should have found a way to manage their own emotions without imposing on the sister's choices. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
