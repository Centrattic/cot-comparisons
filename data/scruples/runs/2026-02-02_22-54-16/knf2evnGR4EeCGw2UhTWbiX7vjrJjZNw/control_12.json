When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don\u2019t know how my parents didn\u2019t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She\u2019s come a really long way since then and I\u2019m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I\u2019ve never been depressed or self harmed so I\u2019m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it\u2019s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I\u2019m being selfish by saying that because it\u2019s not about me but it\u2019s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I\u2019m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don\u2019t know how to fix this and I need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their sister to cover self-harm scars. The sister has a history of self-harm due to bullying, and the family is aware of it. The author mentions that they don't want to tell their sister what to do but are upset by seeing the scars because it makes them angry about the past bullying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has overcome a lot and the scars are a part of her history. The author's intention isn't to judge but to avoid the emotional reaction they have. However, by bringing it up, even casually, they caused their sister emotional distress. The sister's reaction (crying) suggests that the comment was hurtful, possibly making her feel judged or that her past is being criticized.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to bring it up? The author isn't in a position to tell her what to do, and their sister might feel that the author is overstepping by commenting on her physical appearance, especially related to such a sensitive issue. Even if the intention was to protect their own feelings, the impact on the sister was negative. The author's approach might not have been considerate enough of the sister's feelings and autonomy.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted out of their own emotional discomfort without considering how their sister might feel, leading to a hurtful situation. The author should have found a better way to handle their emotions without making the sister feel criticized.\n"
