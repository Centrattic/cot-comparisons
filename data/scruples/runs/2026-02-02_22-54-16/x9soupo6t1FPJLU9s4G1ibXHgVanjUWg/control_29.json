I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to show. He tried to avoid calling her out directly and finally passed a note. The student reacted negatively, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student in a respectful way. He considered different methods and chose a note to avoid confrontation. That seems reasonable. The student might not have been aware of her attire, so the teacher's action was to politely point it out. However, passing a note about someone's underwear could be seen as inappropriate because it's a sensitive topic. There's a power dynamic here as a teacher addressing a student about their personal clothing, which could lead to misunderstandings or rumors. The student's reaction\u2014dirty looks and friends reacting\u2014suggests she felt embarrassed or humiliated. The teacher's method might not be the best approach; maybe a more discreet private conversation after class would be better. But the teacher did try to handle it without making a scene. The key issue is whether this action crossed a boundary. Considering the context, the teacher's intent was to help, but the method might have been unprofessional. It's a gray area, but leaning towards the teacher not being in the wrong since the intent was good, even if the method could be questioned. However, some might argue that it's the teacher's responsibility to avoid commenting on a student's appearance, especially regarding undergarments. So there's a risk here. The answer might depend on cultural or institutional norms. But overall, the teacher's action was to inform, not harass, so answer B (not in the wrong) but with a note that the method could be improved. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the student felt targeted, maybe the teacher's action was unwise, but not necessarily wrong. So B.\n"
