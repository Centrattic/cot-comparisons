I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a male teacher who notices a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, which causes her underwear to show. He tried ignoring it, then noticed she kept doing it with different clothes, so he passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's actions. He was uncomfortable but tried to handle it without calling her out. He considered different methods like talking after class or emailing but decided a note was better. The note was direct but kept it private. The student reacted by putting her feet down, which worked, but then there was backlash.\n\nNow, is the teacher in the wrong? Well, his intention was to inform her without making her embarrassed. However, there's a power dynamic here because he's an adult teacher and she's a student. Even if the student didn't realize, the teacher's responsibility includes maintaining professional boundaries. Maybe the note could be seen as inappropriate because it focuses on a student's clothing in a way that could be misinterpreted. But he did it discreetly, not in front of others. However, the issue might be about how the message was framed. \"Underwear showing\" could be seen as focusing on her appearance rather than the behavior (like feet on desk). Also, even though he thought she didn't know, maybe the teacher should have addressed the feet-up behavior without mentioning the underwear. Maybe using a note about the feet instead. So, while his intention was good, the method might have been unwise. There's also the aspect of a male teacher addressing a female student about her clothing, which can be sensitive. Even if he had good intentions, it's possible others might perceive it as inappropriate, hence the students' reactions and his fear of rumors. In some schools, policies might require reporting such situations, but he didn't report; he handled it himself. So, depending on the context, he might be seen as overstepping. But if the student was unaware, maybe it's a teaching moment. But the way he handled it could still be problematic. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit ambiguous. But given the potential for misinterpretation and the power dynamics, maybe the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because the way he addressed it could be seen as inappropriate. Alternatively, B (No) if the action was reasonable given the situation. Hmm. I think the key is whether the method was appropriate. Since he did it discreetly and with the intention to help, maybe not in the wrong. But the content of the note might have been the issue. Maybe he should have said something like \"keep your feet off the desk\" instead of focusing on the underwear. So, perhaps the answer is A because the note's content was about her underwear, which is the problem. Alternatively, if he had just addressed the behavior, it would be better. Therefore, the teacher's approach was inappropriate, making him at fault.\n"
