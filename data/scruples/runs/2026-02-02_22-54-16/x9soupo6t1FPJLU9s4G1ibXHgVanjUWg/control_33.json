I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. The scenario is that the teacher, a male, noticed a female student in his class wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to be visible. He tried different methods to address it without directly calling her out and finally passed her a note. Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his career.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the teacher's actions were appropriate. The key points here are the teacher's intention and the method he used. The teacher wanted to address the issue privately because he didn't want to embarrass the student in front of her peers. He tried multiple approaches\u2014ignoring it at first, considering after-class conversation or email, but worried about how it might be perceived. Ultimately, he chose a note, which seems like a low-key way to inform her without public shaming.\n\nHowever, the problem arises from the fact that the teacher is a male and the student is female. Even though the intention was to correct a wardrobe issue, the method of communication (a note about underwear) could be misinterpreted, especially in a school setting where boundaries between teachers and students are strictly enforced. The student's reaction and the subsequent dirty looks suggest that she or her peers might have felt uncomfortable or targeted. Even if the teacher's intent was purely professional, the perception is important here.\n\nIn many educational institutions, there are strict guidelines about communication between teachers and students to prevent any potential issues of harassment or inappropriate conduct. A note from a teacher to a student about their underwear, regardless of the intent, could be seen as overstepping professional boundaries. The teacher could have opted for a more discreet and formal approach, such as speaking to the student privately in a professional setting, perhaps with a staff member present, to avoid any ambiguity.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the student was repeatedly making the same mistake might indicate a need for a more educational approach, like discussing appropriate dress code during a class session or referring her to the school's administration for guidance. The teacher might have been overstepping by taking it upon himself to address the issue directly, especially without first consulting the school's policies on such matters.\n\nIn summary, while the teacher's intention was to address a wardrobe malfunction, the method he chose could be seen as inappropriate given the power dynamic between a teacher and student. The potential for misunderstanding is high, and even if the teacher is not in actual wrong, the perception could harm his professional reputation. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the teacher being in the wrong due to the inconsiderate method of addressing the issue.\n"
