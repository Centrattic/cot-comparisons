I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher did something wrong here. So, he's a male high school teacher, and a female student kept wearing skirts and putting her feet up, showing her underwear. He felt uncomfortable and tried to tell her without making a big deal out of it. He passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, making him worry about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both angles. The teacher's intention was to let the student know she was flashing her underwear without embarrassing her. He tried different methods like talking to her after class or emailing but was concerned about how it would look. Passing a note seems like a discreet way to address it. But maybe there's a problem with the approach?\n\nFrom the student's perspective, a teacher writing a note about underwear could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamics in a teacher-student relationship. Even if the teacher had good intentions, the student might feel violated or harassed. The note could be misinterpreted, and in some cases, such interactions might be considered unprofessional or even a form of sexual harassment, depending on the context and how it's handled.\n\nBut the teacher claims he wasn't making a sexual advance; he was just trying to inform her. However, in a school setting, any communication between a teacher and student about their body, especially something as personal as underwear, can be problematic. There are policies in place to prevent such situations to avoid any potential for misconduct, even if the teacher's intent was innocent.\n\nAnother angle: the teacher noticed this over several days and tried to find a non-confrontational way to address it. He might have thought passing a note was the best solution. But maybe he should have addressed it in front of the class, like reminding all students to be modest, rather than singling out one student. That way, he avoids any individual attention which could lead to rumors or misinterpretation.\n\nAlso, considering the consequences: the student and her friends now see him as a creep. Even if he did nothing wrong, the perception is there. In educational settings, maintaining professional boundaries is crucial. The act of passing a note about underwear might cross a line, regardless of intent.\n\nBut wait, the student was repeatedly showing her underwear, and the teacher was uncomfortable. Ignoring it might not be appropriate either. There's a responsibility to address inappropriate behavior, but the method matters. Maybe the teacher should have spoken to her privately in front of others or involved the school administration's proper channels.\n\nIn some cases, if a student is consistently showing undergarments, the teacher is expected to address it through appropriate channels, like talking to the student about school dress code policies. However, the teacher's approach here was a direct, personal note which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nSo, putting it all together: while the teacher's intention was to correct a behavior that made him uncomfortable, the method he chose could be seen as inappropriate due to the teacher-student relationship dynamics. Even if his intent was good, the action might be considered unprofessional or contribute to a hostile environment. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong because of how he handled the situation rather than the fact that he addressed it.\n"
