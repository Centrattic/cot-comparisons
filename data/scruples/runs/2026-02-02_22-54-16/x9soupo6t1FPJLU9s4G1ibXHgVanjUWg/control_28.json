I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher, and he's dealing with a female student who keeps showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk, especially when wearing skirts. He tried different methods to address it without making her feel embarrassed, like passing a note that says \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted by scoffing and putting her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors and his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about appropriate conduct between a teacher and student. The teacher's intention was to address the issue politely and without public embarrassment. He considered other methods like talking to her after class or emailing, but he was concerned about how it might look. The note was direct but non-sexual, just pointing out the practical issue. \n\nHowever, even though his intention was to be respectful, there's a potential issue with a teacher communicating with a student about their clothing in any form. The student is a minor, and any direct communication about their personal appearance, even if well-intentioned, could be misinterpreted or used against the teacher. The fact that the student and her friends now see him as a creep suggests that the method might have been inappropriate, regardless of his intent. \n\nMoreover, the teacher's responsibility includes maintaining professional boundaries and avoiding any situation that could be perceived as inappropriate. Even if the student was unaware of her clothing, the teacher's job isn't to comment on her attire. The correct approach might have been to address the behavior (like having feet on the desk) without referencing the underwear, perhaps by reminding her to keep her feet off the desk. \n\nSo, while the teacher's intent wasn't malicious, the action might have crossed a boundary. The note, though private, could still be problematic in this context. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong for engaging in such communication.\n"
