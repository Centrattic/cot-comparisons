I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male, and he's had a student wearing skirts with her feet up, causing her underwear to show. He tried different ways to communicate this without being obvious. Eventually, he passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" which led to negative reactions from the student and her friends.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student politely. He considered various methods: talking to her after class, emailing, but worried about how each might be perceived. The note was a direct but discreet approach. The student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down, so maybe the message was received. However, the aftermath caused tension and dirty looks, leading to potential rumors.\n\nNow, is the teacher in the wrong? The key points here are the method of communication and the appropriateness of the action. The teacher's note was brief and to the point, avoiding any personal or inappropriate content. He didn't make a big deal out of it, just communicated the issue. The student's friends' reactions might be due to misunderstanding or jealousy, but the teacher's action was about a factual observation.\n\nHowever, there is a concern about the dynamic between teacher and student. Even if well-intentioned, discussing personal things like underwear could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially in a professional setting. The teacher might have considered a more formal approach, like speaking privately to the student during office hours, but he chose a note to avoid embarrassment. The note itself is neutral and factual, so it's hard to argue it's inappropriate. The student's response suggests she understood the message, so the teacher's intention was achieved without overstepping.\n\nIn many cases, teachers are expected to handle such situations discreetly to protect the student's dignity. The teacher here tried multiple ways to handle it respectfully. The problem now is the student's reaction and her friends' perception, not the teacher's initial action. Unless there's a school policy against such notes, the teacher's approach seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the teacher is not in the wrong.\n"
