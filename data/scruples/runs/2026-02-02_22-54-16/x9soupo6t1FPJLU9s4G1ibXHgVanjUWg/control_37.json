I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: a male teacher notices a female student wearing a skirt and has her feet up on the desk, showing her underwear. He notices this multiple times, tries different ways to address it, and finally writes a note. The student reacts, but now there's tension with her and her friends.\n\nI need to determine if the teacher's actions were appropriate. The key points here are the power dynamic between a teacher and student, the method of communication, and the potential for misinterpretation.\n\nTeachers have a responsibility to maintain professionalism. Even if the teacher's intention was to address an innocent mistake, the way he communicated it could be problematic. Passing a note about a student's underwear might be seen as overstepping, especially given the teacher's position of authority. It's possible that the student felt the note was inappropriate or that the teacher was inappropriately focused on her appearance.\n\nAlso, considering the student's age, if she's an upperclassman, she's likely around 17-18. The teacher is 30, which is a significant age difference. Any personal communication about such a topic could lead to rumors or misunderstandings, even if the teacher's intent was purely professional.\n\nThe teacher's options were limited: confronting her in person, emailing, or passing a note. Each has risks. Confronting her in person might have been uncomfortable but could have been handled discreetly. The note, while private, might have been too direct and could be interpreted as a breach of professional boundaries.\n\nMoreover, the student's reaction of scoffing and the subsequent dirty looks from her friends suggest that the message was received as awkward or inappropriate. The teacher's concern about rumors leading to career issues is valid because in such situations, perception matters a lot.\n\nSo, even though the teacher's intention was to help the student, the method chosen might not have been the best. The power imbalance makes any direct comment on a student's appearance potentially problematic. The answer is likely that the teacher is in the wrong because the action, while well-intentioned, crossed a professional boundary.\n"
