I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. The situation is that the student was sitting in the front with a skirt, put her feet up, and showed her underwear. The teacher tried to handle it with a note, but now there's tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's actions. He noticed the student's clothing choice and the position of her feet, which led to her underwear being visible. He tried to address it discreetly with a note, which is a common approach in such situations. The key points here are intent and method. The teacher's intention was to inform the student without embarrassing her publicly. Using a note is a non-confrontational way, avoiding a potentially awkward conversation in front of peers or in an email that might be misinterpreted.\n\nBut there are some potential issues. The teacher is male and the student is female. Even though the teacher's intention was to help, there's a risk of misperception, especially in a professional setting. The student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks. This suggests that the student might feel targeted or accused, even if unintentionally. \n\nAnother angle is the appropriateness of the teacher's method. Passing a note about underwear could be seen as overly personal. The teacher could have addressed it in a more general manner, like a respectful reminder about appropriate desk behavior without referencing the underwear specifically. Maybe a note like \"please keep your feet on the floor\" would be more about behavior than appearance. However, the teacher's approach might have been necessary if the issue was recurring, but the way it was handled could be part of the problem.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of power dynamics. As a teacher, he has authority over the student, so even a well-intentioned note could be misinterpreted. The concern is that any personal communication between a teacher and a student, especially regarding physical appearance, can lead to misunderstandings. The fact that the student and her friends are now upset suggests that the approach didn't work well in maintaining a professional distance.\n\nThe teacher's options were limited: he didn't want to call her out publicly, email might be problematic, and confronting her in front of friends could be awkward. The note was a middle ground, but perhaps not the best. Another possible approach could be to address the behavior without mentioning the underwear, focusing on the feet on the desk, which is a classroom rule. That way, it's about behavior rather than clothing, reducing the personal aspect.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's tricky. His intention was to correct a situation that made him uncomfortable, and he tried to do it respectfully. However, the method might have been too direct and personal, leading to the student's perception of being targeted. The teacher's concern about rumors and career is valid because even if he's innocent, the perception can still cause issues. So while the teacher might not be malicious, the action could still be seen as inappropriate due to the context and method used.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the action was within appropriate boundaries. If the teacher's intention was good and the method was as discreet as possible, he might not be in the wrong. But if the approach was too personal and could be seen as invading the student's privacy, then maybe he is. The key is whether the action was professional. In many educational codes of conduct, teachers are advised to avoid personal communications with students that could be misinterpreted. Since this was a one-time note about appearance, it's a gray area. However, considering the potential for misunderstanding and the resulting tension, it's possible that the teacher overstepped, even if unintentionally.\n"
