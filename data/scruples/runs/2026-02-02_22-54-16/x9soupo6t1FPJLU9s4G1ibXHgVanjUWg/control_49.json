I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student repeatedly showing her underwear by putting her feet on the desk. He tried different methods to address it without making her uncomfortable, eventually passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted negatively, and now he's worried about his reputation and relationships with students.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the intent and the method. The teacher's goal was to inform the student that she was showing her underwear, which is a valid concern. However, the way he chose to communicate this\u2014passing a note\u2014might not have been the best approach. \n\nIn a professional setting like a school, interactions between teachers and students, especially of the opposite gender, need to be handled with care. A note about underwear could be misinterpreted, even if the intention was innocent. There's a possibility that the note could be seen as inappropriate or overstepping professional boundaries, leading to rumors or misunderstandings. \n\nThe teacher considered other methods like talking to her after class or emailing, but decided against them due to potential awkwardness. However, the note method introduced its own issues. The student and her friends now view him as a \"creep,\" which affects his professional environment. Even though there's no indication he's in trouble with superiors, the social dynamics in the school have changed.\n\nAnother angle is the student's behavior. She was repeatedly showing her underwear without realizing it. The teacher's responsibility is to address it, but the method should align with school policies. Maybe he should have approached her in a more formal setting, like during a private meeting, or involved the student's parents or a school administrator if the behavior persisted. \n\nAlso, considering the age difference and the power dynamic in the teacher-student relationship, any personal communication that's not through official channels can be problematic. The note could be perceived as a private, potentially inappropriate message. In many schools, even well-intentioned messages can lead to disciplinary action if they're not handled properly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the teacher had good intentions, the method he used to address the situation may have been unwise. The act of passing a note about a student's underwear, regardless of intent, can be seen as crossing professional boundaries and is likely to cause misunderstandings. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong for not choosing a more appropriate method of communication in a professional setting.\n"
