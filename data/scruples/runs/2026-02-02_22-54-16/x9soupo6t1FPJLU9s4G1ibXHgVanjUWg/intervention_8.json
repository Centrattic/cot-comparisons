I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the teacher in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe teacher is male, and the student is a female upperclassman. She was sitting in the front row, wore a skirt, and put her feet up on the desk, showing her underwear. The teacher found this uncomfortable but ignored it. Then in the following days, she wore shorts or jeans but kept her feet up. When she wore a skirt again, the same issue happened. The teacher thought she might not realize she's flashing her underwear. He didn't want to call her out in front of others, so he considered holding her after class but worried about how it might look. He thought about emailing her but was concerned about the perception and timing. In the end, he passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" She scoffed and put her feet down, but now her and her friends give him dirty looks, making him worry about rumors and his career.\n\nThe user asks if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intent. He seems to be trying to address an issue where a student is inadvertently showing her underwear. His main concern is not to embarrass her or make her uncomfortable, so he chose the note as a private way to inform her. However, there's a potential issue here with a teacher communicating with a student about such a personal matter, especially in a way that could be misinterpreted. \n\nBut the teacher's intention was to correct a modesty issue that the student wasn't aware of. The note itself is straightforward and just a statement of fact. There's no indication of inappropriate interest or harassment from the teacher. The problem arises from the student's reaction and the potential perception by others. \n\nHowever, from a professional standpoint, even if the intent is good, the communication between a teacher and a student about such a personal topic can be problematic. It's possible that the student felt embarrassed or that the teacher was overstepping, which might have led to the dirty looks and rumors. But the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the appropriateness of the method. Passing a note might be the least intrusive way, but in some educational environments, any direct communication about a student's appearance, especially in a personal context, might be seen as inappropriate. The teacher might have handled it differently by addressing it through the school's protocols, perhaps involving another staff member or the student's parents, but the scenario states that there's no mention of superiors being involved, and the teacher didn't face any disciplinary action.\n\nThe key factors here are the teacher's intent (to inform the student of an unintentional wardrobe malfunction) and the method (a private note to avoid public embarrassment). If the teacher acted in good faith and without any ulterior motive, then he's likely not in the wrong. However, the potential for misinterpretation exists, especially if the student or others perceive it as the teacher prying into her personal life or having inappropriate thoughts.\n\nBut given that the teacher took steps to handle it discreetly and without confrontation, and there's no indication of any malicious intent, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong). However, the teacher should perhaps be more cautious in how such situations are handled in the future, maybe by following school policies more closely or involving other staff to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\n"
