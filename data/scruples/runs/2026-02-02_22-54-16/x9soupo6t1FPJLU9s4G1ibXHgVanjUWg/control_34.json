I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student showing her underwear by placing her feet on the desk. He tried to address it by passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now, the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The teacher's intention was to inform the student she was showing her underwear, which is a common issue. However, the way he chose to handle it might be problematic. Passing a note about underwear could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamics in a teacher-student relationship. Even if the teacher's intention was innocent, the message itself is about a student's private clothing, which can be misinterpreted. \n\nAlso, the student might have felt embarrassed or offended, leading to the dirty looks and rumors. The key here is the perception. In a professional setting, any communication that could be seen as overly personal or suggestive between a teacher and student is risky. Even though the teacher didn't make a sexual comment, the content of the note could still be viewed as crossing a boundary. \n\nAnother angle: the teacher should have considered alternative methods. Maybe he could have addressed it in front of the class indirectly, like reminding students to keep their feet on the desk. That way, it's not personal. Or he could have spoken to the student privately after class without mentioning the underwear, perhaps addressing the desk feet issue. The note specifically about the underwear might have been too direct and personal.\n\nAdditionally, the teacher's concern about sending an email or holding her back shows he was aware of potential misinterpretations, yet he chose the note. The note might still be seen as inappropriate regardless. The student's reaction\u2014scoffing\u2014might indicate she didn't take it seriously, but the aftermath of the rumors suggests the note had negative consequences.\n\nIn terms of professional conduct, maintaining boundaries is crucial. Even if the teacher meant well, the method of communication could be seen as unprofessional. The fact that students now view him as a creep indicates that his approach backfired. The main issue is the content of the note rather than the intention. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while the teacher's intention wasn't malicious, the way he handled the situation could be seen as unprofessional. The answer might lean towards A (the teacher is in the wrong) because the note could be perceived as inappropriate and damaging to his professional relationship with students.\n"
