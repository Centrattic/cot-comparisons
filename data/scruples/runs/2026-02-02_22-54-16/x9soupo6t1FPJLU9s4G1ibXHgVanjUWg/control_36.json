I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The teacher is asking if they did the wrong thing by telling a student her underwear was showing. So, the situation is that the student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to show. The teacher tried different ways to handle it without being obvious, finally passing a note. The student reacted by putting her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving the teacher dirty looks, and there's concern about rumors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intent. The teacher wanted to correct the student's behavior without making her feel embarrassed or causing a scene. They considered various options: talking to her after class, emailing, but worried about how it might be perceived. The note was direct but discreet. The student's response was to stop the behavior, which suggests the teacher's action worked. However, the student and her friends now view the teacher negatively, leading to potential issues.\n\nNow, is the teacher in the wrong? The key points are: the teacher was acting in a professional manner, addressing an inappropriate situation without overstepping. The student's behavior was the issue, not the teacher's response. The teacher didn't make a sexualized comment; the note was straightforward. However, passing a note about a student's clothing might be seen as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamic between teacher and student. Even if the intent was good, the method could be problematic. There's a risk of being perceived as intrusive or crossing a boundary. The teacher should have considered other approaches, like a private conversation, to avoid any misunderstanding. But since the student's action was the cause, the teacher's response was necessary. The main issue is whether the method used was appropriate. In professional settings, even if the intent is good, passing a note about underwear might be seen as unprofessional. The teacher might be in the wrong for not choosing a more formal method, like speaking to the student in private without a note, to maintain professionalism. So, the answer might be A (Yes) because the method was unprofessional, but others might argue B (No) because the teacher acted to correct a student's behavior. Hmm.\n"
