I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a high school teacher who noticed a student showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk. He tried ignoring it, but the student kept doing it. He decided to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student scoffed and put her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, making him worry about rumors and his job.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to address an issue that made him uncomfortable. He considered different methods but chose a note to avoid making her feel embarrassed or causing a scene. The main question is whether his action was appropriate.\n\nIn a professional setting, teachers need to maintain boundaries. However, pointing out a student's underwear showing isn't inherently inappropriate if done respectfully. The note was direct but likely the least confrontational approach. However, there's a risk in how it might be perceived. The student might feel targeted or that the teacher is overstepping, especially given the power dynamic. \n\nBut the teacher's actions were to inform the student of something they might not be aware of, not to comment on her appearance in a judgmental way. The problem arises more from the potential for misinterpretation or the student's reaction. If the teacher's note was meant to be helpful, then it's a reasonable action. However, the fact that the student and her friends now view him negatively suggests that the communication might have been received the wrong way. \n\nAlso, considering the environment, a teacher should be cautious about any communication that could be seen as inappropriate. Using a note might have been a way to avoid public embarrassment for the student, but in some contexts, even a note about underwear could be seen as crossing a line. The key here is whether the teacher acted out of concern for the student's awareness or for his own comfort. \n\nThe teacher's actions don't seem malicious. He tried to handle it discreetly. However, in a professional setting, there's always a risk of misinterpretation, especially with sensitive topics. The fact that he's male and the student is female adds another layer. Even if his intentions were good, the perception matters. The student's reaction and the resulting tension suggest that the method might not have been the best, but the intent wasn't wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, while the teacher's approach might have been well-intentioned, the situation's potential for misinterpretation exists. However, since he acted to inform the student of something she wasn't aware of in a discreet manner, it's more about the method's appropriateness rather than being outright wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
