I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a male high school teacher, and a female student was repeatedly showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk. He tried to handle it by passing her a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" which worked for a moment but led to her and her friends giving him dirty looks afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the power dynamics here. The teacher has a position of authority over his students. Even though the student was the one showing her underwear, the way the teacher addressed it might be problematic. The note was direct, but maybe it's inappropriate for a teacher to be commenting on a student's clothing in that way, regardless of the intent. \n\nHigh school students can be very conscious about their appearance, and the teacher's action, though well-intentioned, might come off as intrusive or creepy. Even if the student was the one causing the issue, the teacher's method of addressing it could be seen as crossing a boundary. The note could lead to rumors or make the student feel embarrassed, which affects the classroom environment. \n\nAlso, considering the potential for misinterpretation, the teacher's action might be perceived as harassment or inappropriate attention. Schools usually have strict policies about interactions between teachers and students to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Even if the teacher meant to be kind, the act of pointing out a student's underwear could be seen as violating those policies.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher did handle it in a private way without involving others, which is respectful. But the method itself might not align with professional boundaries. There might be better ways to handle the situation, like addressing it indirectly or through a more formal channel if the behavior persisted. The teacher's intention was to help the student, but the method could be questioned in terms of professionalism.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the teacher's action might be seen as inappropriate because it's a personal and sensitive matter that a student might not want addressed by a teacher. The risk of misunderstanding or rumors is high, and maintaining professional boundaries is crucial. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong despite his good intentions.\n"
