I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student showing her underwear while sitting with her feet on the desk. He tried ignoring it at first, but after it kept happening, he passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted with a scoff and put her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation and career.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the teacher did something wrong. The key points here are about boundaries, professionalism, and the appropriateness of his actions. \n\nThe teacher's intention was to inform the student without embarrassing her, which is understandable. However, the method he chose\u2014a note during class\u2014might have been problematic. Writing a note about a student's undergarments in a public setting, even if meant to be discreet, can come across as inappropriate. There could be a perception of impropriety, especially given the power dynamic between a teacher and a student. Even if the teacher had good intentions, the note could be seen as a privacy invasion or a breach of professional boundaries. \n\nSchools usually have policies about such interactions. Teachers are expected to maintain a certain level of professionalism, and direct communication about a student's attire, especially undergarments, should ideally be done through more formal channels, like speaking to the student in private or involving the appropriate school authorities if necessary. \n\nThe student's reaction and the subsequent negative perception from her peers suggest that the approach might have been misjudged. The teacher might have inadvertently created a situation where he's seen as overstepping, even if unintentionally. \n\nHowever, the teacher didn't make any advances or engage in inappropriate behavior beyond the note. He tried to handle it without causing public embarrassment and without involving other people unnecessarily. The fact that the school hasn't taken any action yet might indicate that there's no official wrongdoing, but perception is important in these cases. \n\nIn some contexts, a note might be acceptable if it's brief and professional, but \"your underwear is showing\" is blunt and could be misinterpreted. A better approach might have been to address it in a more formal, less personal way, perhaps by discussing appropriate classroom conduct in general terms without singling out the student. \n\nSo, considering all this, the teacher might be in the right in terms of intent but possibly in the wrong in terms of the method used. The line between professional and personal is very thin here, and the teacher's actions could be seen as crossing it, leading to the negative reactions from the student and her friends. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the teacher being in the wrong due to the manner of his response.\n"
