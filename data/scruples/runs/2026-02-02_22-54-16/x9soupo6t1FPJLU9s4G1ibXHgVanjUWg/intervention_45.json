I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student showing her underwear while sitting with her feet up on the desk. He tried different ways to address it without making her uncomfortable and eventually passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted by scoffing and putting her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The teacher's main concern was to inform the student without causing a scene, which is understandable. He was trying to be discreet and respectful. He considered other methods like holding her after class or emailing her but felt those could be problematic. The note method was intended to be private.\n\nOn the other hand, the student might feel embarrassed or offended by the note, even if it's a simple message. The fact that she and her friends now give him dirty looks suggests there might be a misunderstanding or a cultural sensitivity issue here. The teacher didn't confront her publicly, which is good, but perhaps the note could have been worded differently to avoid any misinterpretation. \n\nHowever, the teacher's actions were motivated by a genuine intention to correct a situation where the student was unknowingly showing her underwear. There's no indication of inappropriate interest from the teacher. The key points here are the teacher's intent and the method used. Since he tried to handle it discreetly and without confrontation, it seems he's not in the wrong. The student's reaction might stem from embarrassment rather than the teacher being at fault. \n\nThe question is whether the teacher crossed a line. Considering the alternatives he tried and the note's content, which is straightforward, it's more about the student's perception. But legally and ethically, as long as the teacher's actions were professional and not harassing, he's probably not in the wrong. The main issue might be the student's misunderstanding or the way the message was received, not the action itself.\n"
