I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is a male teacher who noticed a female student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to show. He tried different ways to address it but finally passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student and her friends are now giving him dirty looks, making him worry about his career. The user is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher was uncomfortable but initially ignored it. The student repeated the behavior, so he felt the need to address it. The note was a direct but discreet way to inform her without public embarrassment. However, the student reacted with scoffing and her friends are now upset. The main issue here is whether the teacher's actions were appropriate or if he overstepped.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher's intention was to correct a wardrobe malfunction, which is a common social courtesy. He tried to handle it privately, avoiding confrontation. On the other hand, some might argue that a teacher commenting on a student's underwear, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as inappropriate due to the power dynamic and the potential for misinterpretation. The student's reaction and the friends' hostility suggest that the message might have been received negatively or perceived as intrusive.\n\nBut the key points are: the teacher didn't make a sexual comment, tried multiple methods to address it, and chose the least confrontational approach. There's no indication he made any inappropriate remarks beyond the note. The student's behavior was the catalyst, and the teacher was trying to be helpful. However, the perception matters in a school setting. Even if the note was meant to be helpful, from the student's perspective, a male teacher pointing out her underwear could be seen as crossing a boundary. The risk of it being misunderstood or leading to rumors is real. \n\nIn some cases, school policies might address how teachers should handle such situations. If the school has specific guidelines, that could sway the answer. But without policy details, the ethical stance is that while the teacher's intention was good, the action might have been unwise given the potential for misinterpretation. The note could be seen as unnecessary or invasive, especially considering the power imbalance between teacher and student. \n\nHowever, the alternative\u2014doing nothing\u2014could lead to the student continuing to show her underwear without knowing, which might be socially awkward for her or others. The teacher's action was to help her, but the method might not have been the best approach. Perhaps he could have spoken to her privately in a non-confrontational way, but the note's content is straightforward and not suggestive, so maybe it's acceptable. \n\nIn summary, the teacher's intention wasn't malicious, and the note was direct. However, the situation's sensitivity and the potential for misunderstanding could place him in a difficult position. But since the note was a simple, non-sexual observation, he might not be in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards B (No), but there's a nuance here about how such situations are handled in educational settings.\n"
