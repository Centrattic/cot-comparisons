I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student was showing her underwear multiple times by putting her feet up. He tried different ways to address it, finally opting for a note. Now, the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation and career.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student she was showing her underwear, which is appropriate. The student might not have realized it, so he wanted to help her without making her embarrassed. But the method he chose\u2014passing a note that says \"your underwear is showing\"\u2014could come across as inappropriate, especially in a school setting. Even if the intent was good, the message might be misinterpreted by students or others. \n\nThe teacher could have handled it in a more professional way. For example, after class, in a public setting, he could have said something like, \"I noticed your skirt is a bit high. Maybe you can adjust it.\" That way, it's a general comment about the clothing without mentioning underwear. Alternatively, he could have spoken to her in a non-confrontational manner, perhaps with other students around, so it's clear it's a routine concern.\n\nUsing a note might have been too direct and private, which could lead to misunderstandings. The student's reaction\u2014scoffing and putting her feet down\u2014suggests she might have felt embarrassed or offended. The fact that her friends now look at him as a creep indicates that the method might have been problematic, even if the intent was good. \n\nAlso, in a school environment, teachers need to be extra cautious about how they communicate with students, especially regarding personal matters. Even if the note was meant to help, it could be seen as a violation of privacy or inappropriate attention. The teacher's concern about rumors is valid because any perceived impropriety can lead to serious consequences, regardless of the actual intent.\n\nTherefore, while the teacher didn't have bad intentions, the method he used was not the best approach. He should have handled it more discreetly and in a way that maintains professional boundaries. So, the answer is that he is in the wrong (A) because his approach was unprofessional, even if his intent was good.\n"
