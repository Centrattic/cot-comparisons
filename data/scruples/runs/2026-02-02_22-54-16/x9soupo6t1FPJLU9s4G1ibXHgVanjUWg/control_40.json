I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. The teacher is male, and the student is female. The situation involves the student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried several methods to address it without making a scene, finally passing a note. Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher's intention was to correct a student's clothing issue in a respectful way. He tried different approaches to avoid embarrassment, which shows he's trying to be considerate. The note itself was direct but brief, which seems appropriate. However, the way the student reacted and the subsequent rumors are concerning. \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, teachers have a duty to maintain appropriate boundaries. But in this case, the teacher is addressing a clothing issue that's within the student's control. The method he used\u2014a note\u2014might be seen as necessary to prevent ongoing visibility. However, using a note about underwear could be misinterpreted, especially in a school setting where teacher-student communication is sensitive. \n\nI should also think about school policies. If the school has specific guidelines on such matters, maybe the teacher should have followed a different protocol, like involving a female staff member or using a more formal approach. But since there's no mention of disciplinary action from superiors, it might not be a violation. \n\nAnother angle is the student's age and the teacher's age. The teacher is 30, and the student is an upperclassman, so likely around 16-18. The communication method could be seen as problematic because of the power dynamic. Even if the teacher's intention was good, the message might be perceived as inappropriate, regardless of intent. \n\nThe student's reaction suggests she might have felt embarrassed or accused, leading to resentment. The teacher's concern about rumors is valid because any communication between a teacher and student outside of academic matters can be scrutinized. \n\nIn conclusion, while the teacher's intention was to address a visible clothing issue, the method chosen (a direct note about underwear) could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if unintentionally. The potential for misunderstanding and the subsequent negative reactions indicate that the teacher might be in the wrong, despite his efforts to handle it discreetly. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
