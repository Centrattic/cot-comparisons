I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a female student keeps showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk when wearing skirts. The teacher is uncomfortable and tries to address it by passing a note. But the student and her friends now give him dirty looks, thinking he's a creep. The teacher is worried about his reputation and career.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's intentions. He wanted to let the student know without embarrassing her, right? He tried different methods like email or talking after class but decided on a note. The note was direct but not explicit. The student might have taken it the wrong way, thinking he was commenting on her inappropriately. But the teacher's action was to inform her she was showing underwear, which is a reasonable thing to point out if the student is unaware.\n\nNow, the problem might be the method. Passing a note in class to a student about their underwear could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of intent. Teachers are in a position of authority, and any personal communication, especially about clothing or body parts, can be misinterpreted. Even if the note was just a heads-up, the student might feel it's a violation of her privacy or a sexual innuendo. The fact that she scoffed and then her friends gave him dirty looks suggests that the message got through but the delivery was problematic.\n\nAlso, considering the power dynamics: a male teacher and a female student. Even if the teacher's intention was good, the interaction could be seen as crossing a boundary. The teacher might have been justified in wanting to help the student, but the approach might not have been professional. Maybe a better way would be to address it in a public, non-confrontational manner, like a general reminder about appropriate dress or desk behavior, without singling her out. Or maybe a discreet verbal comment during class, instead of a note that could be seen as private and awkward.\n\nAnother angle: the teacher waited until she did it multiple times before acting. He thought she might not realize, which is possible. But even so, the way he handled it might have been the issue. The note's content is straightforward, but the context of teacher-student relationship makes any personal note about the student's clothing risky. It's possible that the school's policies or guidelines on teacher-student communication could have a say here. If there were no repercussions from superiors, maybe it's okay, but the teacher is still worried about rumors.\n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. His intention wasn't malicious, but the method could be seen as unprofessional. The key is whether the action crossed a line given the power dynamics. Some might argue that the teacher acted appropriately to inform the student in a respectful way, while others might say that even a well-intentioned note is inappropriate. The fact that the student and her friends reacted negatively might indicate that the approach was not the best. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong not because of intent, but because of the method chosen.\n"
