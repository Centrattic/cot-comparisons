I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher. He saw a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to show. He ignored it at first but noticed it happened again. He decided to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted with a scoff and put her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, possibly affecting his reputation.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student politely without making her embarrassed or causing a scene. He considered other methods like holding her after class or emailing but worried about how it might look. The note was direct but probably the least intrusive method available. \n\nHowever, there are a few points to consider. The student is a minor, and the teacher is an adult. Even though the note was about something as simple as underwear, the power dynamic in a teacher-student relationship is significant. There's a risk that any communication between them about personal matters could be misinterpreted, especially if rumors spread. \n\nAlso, the teacher might have overstepped by commenting on the student's clothing and body without a clear educational reason. The student might feel targeted or that her privacy was invaded. Even if the teacher's intent was good, the method of communication could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher did try to handle it discreetly. The student's behavior (putting feet up) might have been a habitual action she wasn't aware of. But the teacher's approach could have been better. For example, addressing the foot position without commenting on the underwear, or speaking to her privately in a non-confrontational manner. \n\nIn terms of school policies, some institutions have strict rules about communication between teachers and students, especially regarding personal matters. The teacher might need to check if passing a note about a student's clothing is within guidelines. \n\nSo, while the teacher's intention wasn't malicious, the action might have been inconsiderate of the dynamics and could be seen as intrusive. The fact that the student and her friends now give him dirty looks suggests that the approach wasn't effective or appropriate. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong in the eyes of the responder, the answer might lean towards A, but I need to consider if there's a better approach. Alternatively, maybe B because the intent was good. Hmm. The key is whether the action was appropriate. Since the teacher was trying to inform the student, but the method could be seen as crossing a boundary, the answer might be A. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check again. The note was about her underwear, which is a private matter. Even if it's a simple observation, the teacher shouldn't have to comment on a student's clothing. The correct approach would be to address the behavior (feet on desk) without mentioning the underwear. So, maybe the teacher should have handled it differently, hence he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
