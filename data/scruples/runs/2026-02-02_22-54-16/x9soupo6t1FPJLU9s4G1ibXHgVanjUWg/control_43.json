I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, leading to her underwear being visible. He tried to handle it without making a big deal, using a note to inform her. But now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. Let's consider the context. The student was repeatedly showing her underwear, which the teacher found uncomfortable. He tried multiple approaches: initially ignoring it, then changing his approach when she continued. The note was a direct but discreet method. \n\nBut here's the catch: the teacher is a male, and the student is female. Even though his intention was to correct the student, the situation is sensitive because of the power dynamic between a teacher and student. The note might be seen as inappropriate, especially given the potential for misinterpretation. \n\nIn many schools, there are strict policies about communication between teachers and students, especially regarding personal matters. A note about underwear could be perceived as crossing a boundary, regardless of the teacher's intent. Additionally, the fact that the student was in a public classroom setting, and the teacher took it upon himself to address it directly without involving appropriate channels (like a school administrator or counselor) might be an issue. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the student's age. If she's an upperclassman, she's likely a minor, which adds another layer of sensitivity. Even if the teacher had good intentions, the method of addressing the issue could be seen as unprofessional. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher did try to handle it discreetly and without confrontation, which shows he's trying to respect the student's privacy. However, the potential for the situation to be misunderstood or for rumors to spread is a valid concern. The teacher's actions, while well-intentioned, might not align with school policies on appropriate teacher-student interactions. \n\nIn many educational institutions, even if the teacher's intent was correct, the act of sending a personal note about such a matter could be considered a violation of boundaries. The teacher should have probably involved a supervisor or used a more formal, documented approach to address the issue. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the teacher might be in the wrong not because of the act of addressing the underwear showing, but because of the method and the potential for misinterpretation given the teacher-student relationship. The appropriate action would have been to follow school protocols for such situations rather than handling it personally.\n"
