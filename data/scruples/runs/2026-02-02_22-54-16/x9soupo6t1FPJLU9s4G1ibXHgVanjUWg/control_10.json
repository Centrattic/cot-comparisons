I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who had a female student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to be visible. He tried ignoring it, but when it continued, he passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student and her friends started giving him dirty looks, and now he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student without causing embarrassment. He considered several methods\u2014talking to her after class, emailing, but opted for a note. The key point here is whether his action was appropriate. \n\nIn a professional setting, teachers must maintain boundaries. However, the situation involves a student's appearance, which is a valid concern. The teacher didn't make any inappropriate advances or comments beyond the note. The note was straightforward and professional, just pointing out the fact.\n\nThe student's reaction and the subsequent dirty looks from her friends could be due to misinterpretation. The student might have felt embarrassed or accused, leading to resentment. However, the teacher's action was necessary to address a situation that could be distracting or inappropriate. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no wrongdoing on the teacher's part. He didn't engage in any misconduct. The problem stems from the student's behavior, and the teacher acted in a way that was respectful and aimed at maintaining a proper learning environment. Superiors not taking action suggests that the school sees no issue. \n\nThe teacher could have handled it differently, perhaps by speaking to the student privately after class to explain, but his method wasn't wrong. The main issue is the student's repeated behavior, not the teacher's response. Therefore, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
