I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. The situation is that the student was wearing skirts and had her feet up on the desk, leading to her underwear being visible. The teacher tried different ways to address it and finally used a note. The student and her friends now give him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is male, the student is female, and it's a high school setting. The teacher noticed the underwear showing multiple times and felt uncomfortable. The student might not be aware of it. The teacher tried to handle it discreetly with a note to avoid confrontation or making a big deal out of it. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the teacher did something wrong. From a professional standpoint, teachers have a duty to maintain appropriate boundaries and address any behavior that's against school policies. However, the method of passing a note might be questionable. While the intention was to inform the student without embarrassment, the note's content could come across as invasive or inappropriate, especially given the power dynamic between a teacher and a student.\n\nEven if the teacher's action was meant to be helpful, the way he chose to communicate it could be seen as unprofessional. Some schools have specific guidelines on how to address such issues, often requiring a more formal approach, like a private conversation or involving a colleague to be present. The student's reaction and the subsequent rumors suggest that the approach might not have been well-received or appropriate in the school environment. \n\nMoreover, the age difference and the nature of the message (about underwear) could lead to misunderstandings or accusations of misconduct, regardless of the teacher's intent. It's crucial for educators to be mindful of how their actions might be perceived, even if they believe they're acting in a professional manner. \n\nThe teacher might not be in legal trouble since there's no mention of complaints from superiors, but the social implications for his career are significant. The note could easily be misinterpreted, leading to damage in his professional reputation. Therefore, even if he wasn't in the wrong in terms of policy, the approach was unwise. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method used, while well-intentioned, was unprofessional and could lead to serious consequences. The teacher should have handled it through more appropriate channels to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\n"
