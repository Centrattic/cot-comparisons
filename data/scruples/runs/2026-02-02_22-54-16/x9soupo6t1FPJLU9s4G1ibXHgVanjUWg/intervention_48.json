I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. The situation involves a male teacher who noticed a female student wearing skirts and putting her feet up on the desk, leading to her underwear being visible. He tried different methods to address this without being confrontational, eventually passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student and her friends now give him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher's intention was to address a wardrobe malfunction without embarrassing the student publicly. He tried non-confrontational methods like a note. The student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down, but later, the social dynamics changed. \n\nThe key points here are the teacher's approach and whether it was appropriate. Using a note might have been the least invasive method available to him, given the potential for public shaming if he addressed her directly in front of others. However, some might argue that any communication between a teacher and student about personal clothing could be seen as inappropriate, especially in a professional setting. But the teacher's intent was to correct a visible issue, not to make a comment on her clothing choice itself.\n\nAnother angle is the student's perspective. If she didn't realize her underwear was showing, the teacher's note was a necessary intervention. However, the note might have been misinterpreted, leading to the student and her friends perceiving the teacher as intrusive. The question here is whether the method of communication was appropriate. \n\nIn terms of professional boundaries, teachers are expected to maintain a certain standard. However, the situation here is about a genuine problem (wardrobe malfunction) that the teacher addressed in a discreet manner. There's no indication that the teacher had any ulterior motives. \n\nThe potential for rumors and the impact on the teacher's career is a valid concern. But the teacher's actions were aimed at solving a problem, not creating one. The fact that the school hasn't taken any action against him suggests that, from an administrative standpoint, there might not be a case here. \n\nConsidering all this, the teacher's actions seem to be in line with trying to handle a situation respectfully and discreetly. The note was a direct but private way to inform the student without involving others. While the student's reaction was negative, the teacher's intent was not to embarrass or harass but to correct a situation that made him uncomfortable and that could have been a distraction for others as well. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the teacher's actions were appropriate given the circumstances, aimed at addressing a visible issue without public confrontation.\n"
