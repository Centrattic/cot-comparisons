I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher saw a student showing her underwear because she had her feet up on the desk in a skirt. He tried ignoring her but she kept doing it. He considered different ways to tell her without making her embarrassed or causing a scene. Finally, he passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted by scoffing and putting her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks. He's worried about rumors and his reputation.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a teacher's perspective, maintaining professionalism is key. However, the situation here involves a student's behavior that he felt was inappropriate. The teacher's goal was to address it without causing embarrassment or creating a confrontation. Passing a note directly seems like a private way to let her know, which is considerate. The student's reaction suggests she didn't take it the right way, maybe thinking he was being inappropriate. But the teacher's intention was to correct her behavior, not to harass. \n\nPossible issues: Is a male teacher commenting on a female student's underwear in a note appropriate? It could be seen as crossing a line, especially given the power dynamic. Even if the teacher's intent was good, the act of focusing on a student's underwear, regardless of the reason, might be perceived as inappropriate. However, the alternative\u2014ignoring it or taking no action\u2014could also be problematic if it's recurring behavior. \n\nIn some schools, there are strict policies about communication between teachers and students. A note about underwear might be flagged in a complaint. But since there's no mention of any official reprimand, maybe the school doesn't see it as an issue. Still, the teacher's action might have made the student uncomfortable, leading to the dirty looks and potential rumors. \n\nI think the teacher's intention was good, but the method might not have been the best. Maybe he should have addressed it in the moment, like a verbal cue without the note. But passing a note was an attempt to be discreet. It's a tricky situation. Legally, unless there's a policy violation, maybe he's not wrong, but socially, it's a bit iffy. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he acted to correct her, but the scenario is close.\n"
