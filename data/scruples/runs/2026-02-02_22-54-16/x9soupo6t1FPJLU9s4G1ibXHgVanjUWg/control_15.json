I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student repeatedly showing her underwear by putting her feet on the desk. He tried different ways to address it without making her uncomfortable, eventually handing her a note. Now, the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the teacher did the right thing. He wanted to inform the student privately to avoid humiliation. The note was direct but brief. He mentions that he considered other methods like talking to her after class or emailing, but those could lead to awkward situations or misunderstandings. The note was a straightforward solution to a problem he felt obligated to address since it's a common social norm to inform someone if their clothing is visible.\n\nHowever, there are potential issues. The teacher is a male teacher addressing a female student about her underwear. Even though his intention was good, the situation could be misinterpreted, especially in the context of a school environment where such interactions are scrutinized. The note might be seen as inappropriate, regardless of intent. Also, the student's reaction suggests that she felt targeted or embarrassed, leading to tension with her friends.\n\nAnother angle is the school's policies. Teachers should be aware of protocols for addressing such issues. Maybe he should have involved a female staff member or used a more formal method, like a private conversation in the presence of another adult. The note, while intended to be discreet, might not align with school policies on handling student-teacher interactions, especially those involving personal appearance.\n\nBut on the other hand, the teacher's intention was to correct a situation that was causing him discomfort, not to invade her privacy. He tried multiple approaches to be respectful and private. The student's reaction might be due to embarrassment rather than misunderstanding the note's purpose. The key is whether his actions crossed a line. Given that he didn't make any sexual comments beyond the note and took steps to avoid confrontation, it's possible he's not in the wrong. However, the potential for misinterpretation is high, and in a school setting, such interactions need to be handled with extra care to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\n\nConsidering all factors, the teacher's action was well-intentioned but perhaps not the best approach. He might have been better off using a different method, like talking to her in a more formal setting or consulting with a colleague. However, the act itself of pointing out her underwear isn't inherently wrong. The problem may lie in the method and the context rather than the action itself. So, the answer is leaning towards B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the approach could have been improved.\n"
