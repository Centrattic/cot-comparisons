I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up on the desk, causing her underwear to show. He tried ignoring it for a few days, but the behavior continued. He decided to pass her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted with a scoff and put her feet down, but now he's facing dirty looks from her and her friends, and he's worried about rumors affecting his career.\n\nFirst, I should consider the teacher's actions. He observed the behavior multiple times and tried different approaches before sending the note. He wanted to avoid calling her out in front of others or involving superiors, which is understandable to maintain a good rapport and avoid any appearance of impropriety. The note itself is direct but brief and professional. The key points here are the intent and the method.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, teachers have a duty to maintain appropriate boundaries. However, pointing out a student's clothing in a respectful manner isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's done discreetly. The teacher's action was to inform the student of an issue that might be unintentional. The problem arises if the communication could be perceived as inappropriate or if it crosses professional boundaries. \n\nThe note is short and to the point, without any personal or suggestive language. The teacher didn't make any lewd comments or follow up in a way that could be seen as inappropriate. However, the student's reaction and the subsequent negative perception from her friends suggest that maybe the method could have been handled differently. \n\nAnother angle is the student's behavior. If she was repeatedly putting her feet up in a way that exposed her underwear, it's possible that she was unaware, as the teacher suspected. The teacher's action was to inform her, which is a reasonable response. The issue might be that the note was a direct approach, but given the teacher's concern about maintaining privacy, it's a valid method.\n\nBut wait, there's a potential for misinterpretation. A 30-year-old teacher sending a note to a student about underwear could be seen as overstepping, even if the intent was professional. However, the note itself is factual and there's no indication of personal interest. The teacher's concern is about maintaining professionalism and avoiding rumors, which is legitimate.\n\nI should also consider school policies. The teacher didn't involve superiors, which might be a point against him if the school has specific procedures. But since there's been no action from superiors, maybe it's within acceptable bounds. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the teacher acted to correct a situation that was making him uncomfortable and could have caused him to be seen as inappropriately focused on the student. By addressing it discreetly, he avoided public embarrassment for the student and tried to handle it in a respectful way. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the teacher should have found another way, like talking to the student in private during office hours. But the teacher considered that and worried about the appearance of holding her back. The note was a middle ground. \n\nIn conclusion, the teacher's intent was professional, the method was discreet, and there's no evidence of wrongdoing. The student's reaction and friends' perceptions might be due to misunderstanding, but the teacher isn't in the wrong for addressing a legitimate issue in a respectful manner.\n"
