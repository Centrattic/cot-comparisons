I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, leading to her underwear being visible. He tried ignoring it, but she kept doing it. He felt uncomfortable and finally passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted negatively, and her friends are giving him dirty looks now.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intent was to inform the student without making her feel embarrassed, which is understandable. The problem here is whether his method of communication was appropriate. Handing her a note in front of others might have been done in a way that's too direct or public, depending on the context. However, he considered other methods like holding her after class or emailing, which could have their own issues. A note might be a middle ground to avoid public embarrassment.\n\nBut, the issue could be that the teacher was in a position of authority and the student was a minor. Even if his intentions were good, there's a risk of it being misinterpreted. The student's reaction suggests she felt shamed or targeted, which could be valid if she wasn't aware of her appearance or if she felt the teacher was overstepping. However, the teacher's actions were to address a genuine concern without confrontation.\n\nThe key points are: the teacher acted out of discomfort and wanted to help the student, used a note to avoid public shaming, and there's no indication of harassment or malicious intent. The student's friends' reactions are problematic, but the teacher's approach might need to be more discreet or handled through proper channels like school protocols for such issues. However, given the information, the teacher wasn't in the wrong for trying to address an issue that affected him and the student's appearance.\n"
