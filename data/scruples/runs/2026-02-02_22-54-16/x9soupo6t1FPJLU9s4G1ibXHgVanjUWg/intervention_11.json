I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. The teacher wrote a note saying \"your underwear is showing\" after the student put her feet up on the desk. The student and her friends gave him dirty looks afterward, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The teacher noticed the student's underwear showing multiple times and tried to handle it discreetly. He passed a note instead of approaching her in front of others or contacting her via email, which could have been more public. He didn't make any inappropriate comments beyond the note. The student might have been unaware of her appearance, so the teacher's intention was to help her without embarrassing her publicly.\n\nBut wait, is it appropriate for a teacher to address this with a student directly? In some cases, schools have specific protocols for such situations. Maybe the teacher should have informed the student's parents or followed a reporting procedure. However, the teacher's main concern was the student's awareness, not harassment. The note was direct but brief and professional. The student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down, which suggests she might have been embarrassed but not harmed.\n\nThe teacher is worried about rumors affecting his career. However, the action was taken in good faith to correct a situation that could be distracting or inappropriate for the student. The key points are that the teacher acted without any malicious intent, chose a private method, and there's no indication of harassment. The student might have felt embarrassed, but the teacher's action was to help her avoid further exposure.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the teacher shouldn't have noticed or addressed it at all, but that's unrealistic. Teachers are in positions to observe students' appearances and sometimes need to address them. The method he used was discreet. If he had done it in front of others, that would be different, but a note seems reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (the teacher is not in the wrong). He acted appropriately to inform the student of a mistake without overstepping. The student's reaction and the friends' dirty looks might stem from misunderstanding or embarrassment, but that doesn't make the teacher at fault.\n"
