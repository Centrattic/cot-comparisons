I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling the student her underwear was showing. The teacher is male, and the student is a female upperclassman. The situation started when the student wore a skirt and put her feet up on the desk, exposing her underwear. The teacher noticed and tried to handle it without being confrontational, eventually passing a note.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher has a good rapport with students and tried non-confrontational methods. The student kept doing the same thing, so the teacher felt the need to address it. But the student and her friends now think the teacher is a creep. The key issue is whether the teacher acted inappropriately.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, teachers are expected to maintain boundaries. However, pointing out a student's exposed underwear is generally seen as a necessary correction to prevent potential embarrassment. The method used\u2014a note\u2014seems discreet. But some might argue that even this is crossing a line, especially if the student didn't realize. Others might say it's the teacher's duty to address it politely.\n\nBut there's another angle: the teacher is a man addressing a female student about her undergarments. Even if done with good intent, it could be perceived as inappropriate. However, the alternative\u2014ignoring it\u2014might lead to the student's embarrassment later. The teacher's intention was to help, not to harass. Since there's no mention of any formal complaints or administrative action, it's possible the school sees no issue. \n\nBut in the eyes of the students, the perception matters. The teacher might have caused a rift in relationships. The question is whether the action was necessary. In most cases, teachers correct such things. However, the method might be questioned. The note was discreet, but perhaps a verbal cue in front of others could be more appropriate. However, the teacher avoided that to not embarrass the student. \n\nSo, the teacher's actions are likely justified as trying to help the student. However, the way it was handled could be seen as crossing a boundary, given the gender dynamic. But since the teacher intended to be helpful and used a private method, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong. Still, some might argue that even this is inappropriate for a teacher to address. \n\nI think the main point is whether the teacher's intent was appropriate. Since there's no malicious intent and the method was discreet, the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Maybe some policies prohibit such interactions. However, the story says no complaints from superiors, so likely okay. So the answer is B.\n"
