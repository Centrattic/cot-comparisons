I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is a male high school teacher who says a female student was showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk while wearing a skirt. He tried to address it by passing her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now, the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his career.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The teacher's intention was to politely inform the student without embarrassing her. He tried different methods like a note, which he thought was the least intrusive. But the student's reaction was negative, and now there's tension.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, as a teacher, he has a responsibility to address inappropriate behavior, but he did so in a private and direct manner. However, there's a potential issue with a teacher communicating about a student's clothing in a way that could be misinterpreted. Even if the student was showing her underwear, the note might be seen as inappropriate or even suggestive, depending on the context. The teacher's action might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if his intent was to correct her.\n\nAlso, the student's behavior\u2014putting feet up on the desk\u2014could be a sign of disrespect or lack of engagement. The teacher might have handled it differently by addressing the behavior without focusing on the underwear. For example, asking her to put her feet down without mentioning the underwear. That way, the focus is on the behavior rather than the clothing. \n\nBut the teacher chose to address the underwear, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if the student was unaware, the method of communication (a note about underwear) might be problematic. It's possible that the teacher should have approached it more formally, perhaps with a conversation after class or involving the school administration to ensure it's handled appropriately without personal interpretation.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher didn't want to embarrass the student, so the note was intended to be private. However, the student's reaction of scoffing and the subsequent resentment from her and friends suggest that the note had unintended consequences. The teacher might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the method and content of the communication could be questioned. \n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. A teacher interacting with a student about personal clothing items, even in a professional setting, can lead to perceptions of impropriety. The note might be seen as a breach of professional boundaries, regardless of the teacher's intentions. This could lead to allegations or damage his reputation even if no formal action was taken.\n\nIn summary, while the teacher's intention was to help the student, the method chosen might not have been the best approach. The note about underwear could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of the intent. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong, but it's a gray area. However, the key point is whether the action was appropriate given the professional relationship. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) because the method of communication could be problematic, even if the intent was good.\n"
