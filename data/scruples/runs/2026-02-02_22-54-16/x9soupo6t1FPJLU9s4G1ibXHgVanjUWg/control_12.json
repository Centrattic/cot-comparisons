I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher, and a female student kept showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk. He tried ignoring it, then passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted negatively, and now he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student politely without making her feel embarrassed. However, the method of passing a note might have been perceived as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamics between a teacher and a student. Even though his intent wasn't harmful, the action could be seen as overstepping, especially if the student felt it was an invasion of privacy or a form of harassment. \n\nThe note itself is direct but maybe not the best approach. Emailing might have been a better option, though the teacher was concerned about how it would look. Alternatively, addressing it in front of the class to avoid singling her out, but that might not be effective either. The teacher tried to avoid confrontation but didn't consider other methods that might be more professional.\n\nThe student's reaction and her friends' dirty looks suggest that the note was received negatively. The teacher's approach might have come off as intrusive, even if it was meant to help. In professional settings, teachers need to be cautious about how they interact with students, especially regarding personal matters. The note could be seen as unprofessional, and even if there's no official reprimand, the perception among students and colleagues could damage his career.\n\nConsidering all this, while the teacher had good intentions, the method he chose was questionable and could be seen as crossing a boundary. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
