I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the teacher is in the wrong for telling the student her underwear was showing.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The teacher is male, the student is female. The student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried to address it in a private way by passing a note. The student reacted with disdain, and now there's tension between the teacher and the student's friends.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the teacher made a student uncomfortable by pointing out her underwear. But wait, the teacher was the one who felt uncomfortable first, right? The student was the one flashing her underwear unintentionally. The teacher tried to correct it without making a scene, which seems reasonable. But the note might have been misinterpreted. The student's reaction suggests she didn't realize she was showing, so the teacher's note was a valid correction. However, the teacher's method of communication might have been inappropriate. Using a note about underwear could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the intent was good. But the alternative methods (email, holding her back) also have issues. The teacher didn't do anything overtly inappropriate, but the situation is delicate because of the power dynamic between teacher and student. The main question is whether the teacher's action was justified. Since the student was unaware, the teacher was trying to help, but the way it was done might have been awkward. However, the teacher didn't make a public accusation or act on personal feelings. The student's friends' reactions suggest a misunderstanding might have spread. The teacher isn't in trouble from superiors, so maybe the action wasn't against school policy. Overall, the teacher's intent was to correct a mistake, not to harass. So, the answer is probably B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
