I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a male high school teacher who had a situation where a female student was showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk. He tried different ways to address it, like passing a note, and now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, thinking he's a creep.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the teacher did something wrong. The student was the one flashing her underwear, so the initial issue is on her. The teacher's job is to maintain a respectful environment. But how he handled it might be the problem. He passed a note that said \"your underwear is showing.\" The note is direct but maybe not the best approach. \n\nWait, as a teacher, he's supposed to handle situations professionally. The problem is that the student might not realize she's showing, but the note could come off as inappropriate. Even if the intent was to correct her, the content of the note could be misinterpreted, especially in a school setting where boundaries are strict. Other students saw the note, and the student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down, but then the tension escalated with her friends giving him dirty looks. \n\nThe teacher's options were limited. He didn't want to call her out in front of others, which is understandable. Emailing might not have been the best either, but a note could be seen as unprofessional. Also, the note's wording is very direct and might be considered harassment from the student's or school's perspective. Even if the teacher didn't mean to be creepy, the action itself could be perceived as such. \n\nSchool policies often require teachers to maintain strict professional boundaries. A note like that, especially from a male teacher to a female student, could be problematic regardless of intent. The fact that the student's friends are now giving him dirty looks suggests that the message might be getting misinterpreted or that the method was inappropriate. \n\nSo, even though the teacher's intention was to correct a situation where the student was unknowingly flashing, the way he did it could be seen as crossing a boundary. The correct approach would have been to handle it more discreetly and professionally, maybe by saying something in a respectful manner without being explicit. \n\nTherefore, the teacher is in the wrong because he used an inappropriate method to address the issue, which could be perceived as violating professional boundaries or being suggestive, regardless of the student's actions. The answer is A.\n"
