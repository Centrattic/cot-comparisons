I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The teacher noticed a student showing her underwear multiple times by putting her feet on the desk. He tried different ways to address it without making her uncomfortable\u2014like a note. The student reacted negatively, and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to correct a modesty issue. He didn't confront her publicly or via email, which could have been more problematic. Using a note seems discreet. But maybe the way he phrased the note was too direct? \"Your underwear is showing\" might be blunt, but it's a straightforward message. \n\nHowever, as a teacher, he's in a position of authority. Even if the student was the one causing the issue, the teacher's action could be misinterpreted. The student's reaction and the subsequent rumors suggest that the message might have been perceived as intrusive or inappropriate, especially from a male teacher to a female student. \n\nAlso, the teacher didn't report the behavior to a supervisor. If the student was intentionally showing her underwear, it could be considered inappropriate behavior from the student's side. The teacher might have a responsibility to report that rather than handle it alone. \n\nBut the teacher's method of using a note was meant to avoid embarrassment. The problem is that the message could be seen as a privacy invasion. Even if the student was at fault, the teacher's approach might have been unprofessional. \n\nIn the end, while the teacher's intention was good, the method might not have been the best. The answer is likely that the teacher is in the wrong (A) because of the potential for misinterpretation and the lack of using proper channels. However, some might argue he's not in the wrong (B) because he was trying to correct a modesty issue discreetly.\n"
