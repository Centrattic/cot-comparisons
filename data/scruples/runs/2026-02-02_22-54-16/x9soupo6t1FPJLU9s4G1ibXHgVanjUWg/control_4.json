I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. The situation is that a female student was wearing a skirt and had her feet up on the desk, causing her underwear to be visible. The teacher passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation and relationships with students.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's actions. He noticed the student's clothing choice and behavior multiple times. He tried to address it discreetly by passing a note. He didn't want to embarrass her or make it awkward, so he chose a non-confrontational method. But the student reacted with scoffing, and others are now upset.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, the teacher's intention was to inform the student about her appearance. However, the manner of delivery might be an issue. Giving a note about underwear to a student can be awkward regardless, but in this case, the student was a minor, and the teacher is male. Even if the teacher had good intentions, there's a potential for misinterpretation. The student might feel targeted or embarrassed. Also, the fact that the student was wearing a skirt and had her feet up on the desk could be a matter of personal choice, but the teacher's intervention might cross a boundary. \n\nAnother angle: the teacher's job is to create a comfortable learning environment. However, commenting on a student's clothing choice, especially in a private setting, might be seen as overstepping. The teacher could have addressed it by talking to the student in a private setting without focusing on the underwear, maybe suggesting a more appropriate seat if the clothing was causing issues. Alternatively, maybe the school has policies on dress code that the teacher should have followed instead of personal intervention.\n\nBut the teacher says he didn't want to call her out, which is understandable. However, passing a note about underwear could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamic between a teacher and a student. Even if the teacher was just trying to be helpful, it might look like he was focusing too much on the student's body, which could lead to rumors or concerns about inappropriate attention.\n\nIn conclusion, while the teacher's intention might have been to help, the method chosen could be problematic in the context of a teacher-student relationship. The potential for misunderstanding and the impact on the teacher's professional reputation are significant. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong for not choosing a different approach.\n"
