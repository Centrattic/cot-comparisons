I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher did something wrong by telling a student her underwear was showing.\n\nFirst, the situation: the teacher is male, and a female student kept wearing skirts with her feet up, causing her underwear to show. He tried different ways to address it, finally passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted negatively, and now he's worried about rumors and his reputation.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think. From a professional standpoint, teachers have a duty to maintain appropriate conduct. But in this case, he's addressing a student about an accidental wardrobe malfunction. The note itself was direct but probably necessary. However, the method might be questionable. \n\nHe considered various approaches: talking to her after class, emailing, but went with a note. The note was discreet, but maybe there's a better way. The student's reaction was negative, leading to her friends giving him dirty looks. That's concerning because it could be misinterpreted. \n\nBut was he wrong? The intention was to correct a wardrobe issue without making a big deal. However, the power dynamic between a teacher and student is important. Even if it's innocent, the note could be seen as inappropriate, especially since it's about a student's clothing. There's a risk of it being misunderstood, even if his intentions were good. \n\nAlso, the fact that the student didn't realize she was showing might mean she needed to be informed. The teacher's duty is to ensure the student is presentable. But using a note might not be the best approach. Maybe he should have spoken to the student privately without others knowing. However, the note was a discreet way to avoid embarrassment. \n\nBut considering the potential for rumors and the perception from others, maybe the teacher should have handled it differently. However, the act of informing the student about her clothing isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be the method. \n\nIn some cases, teachers have discretion to address such issues. However, the key is whether the note created an inappropriate situation. There's a line between helping a student and invading their privacy. The teacher's intention was appropriate, but the context of teacher-student relationship can make even innocent actions seem inappropriate. \n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the note was meant to help the student and not to invade her privacy, then maybe not. But given the potential for misinterpretation, especially in a school setting, there's a case to be made that he should have handled it another way. However, the act itself isn't malicious. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the method was appropriate. If there's a better way, like speaking in private, but the note was the only option available, maybe it's not his fault. But the note could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nI think the key here is that the teacher's intention was to help, but the act of addressing it directly in writing, especially about a student's undergarments, is risky in a teacher-student relationship. Even if it's innocent, the perception can be damaging. So, he might be in the wrong in terms of how it could be perceived, even if his intention was good.\n"
