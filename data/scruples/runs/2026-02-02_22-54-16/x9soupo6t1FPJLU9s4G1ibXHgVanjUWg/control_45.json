I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The teacher is asking if they're in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. The situation is that a female student keeps wearing skirts and putting her feet up on the desk, causing her underwear to be visible. The teacher tries to handle it discreetly with a note, but now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is male, the student is female. The teacher noticed the issue multiple times and tried to address it without being confrontational. The note was a direct but private way to inform her. The problem is that the student might have been unaware, and the teacher's intention was to correct her, not to intrude. \n\nBut there's a potential issue with power dynamics. A teacher giving a note to a student about their underwear could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of intent. Even if the teacher meant to help, the act itself is sensitive. There's a risk of misinterpretation, especially in a professional setting where boundaries are important. Some might argue that the teacher should have addressed it through other means, like speaking to the student in private during a class break or after class, without any note that could be seen as personal or invasive. \n\nThe fact that the student's friends are now giving dirty looks suggests that the note might have been shared or that the student felt embarrassed. The teacher's approach might not have been the best in terms of maintaining professional boundaries. Even if the teacher's intention was good, the method could be questioned. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the teacher's responsibility to create a comfortable learning environment. If the student's behavior is distracting or making the teacher uncomfortable, the teacher might need to address it. However, the method of addressing it could be more appropriate. Maybe the teacher should have spoken to the student privately without writing a note that could be perceived as personal or prying. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher did try to handle it discreetly and without involving others. The note was straightforward and to the point. The teacher didn't escalate it beyond a private message. So, maybe the teacher isn't entirely in the wrong because the intention was to correct the student's behavior in a respectful way. But the way it was done might have been unprofessional, leading to potential misunderstandings. \n\nIn some schools, there are protocols for teacher-student communication, and a note about personal appearance might not be the standard approach. The teacher might have a case if they can show that they acted in good faith to create a respectful environment. However, the risk of misinterpretation is high, and that's why some might say the teacher is in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the action was professional and appropriate given the context. If the teacher acted with good intentions but in a way that crossed professional boundaries, then they might be in the wrong. If the action was a reasonable and respectful way to address the situation, then maybe not. I'm leaning towards the answer being B (No, the teacher isn't in the wrong) because the intention was to help and the method was discreet, but some might argue A because of the power imbalance. However, considering the steps the teacher took to avoid public confrontation and the fact that there's no indication of harassment or malice, B seems more accurate.\n"
