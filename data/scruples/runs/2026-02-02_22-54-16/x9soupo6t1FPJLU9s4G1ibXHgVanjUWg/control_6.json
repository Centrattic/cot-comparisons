I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a male high school teacher who wrote a note to a student about her underwear showing. He's concerned if he did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, the context: The student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to show. The teacher found it uncomfortable and tried different ways to address it. He passed a note with \"your underwear is showing,\" which made the student and her friends upset, giving him dirty looks. No complaints from superiors yet, but he's worried about rumors affecting his career.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let me break it down. As a teacher, maintaining professional boundaries is crucial. The student's behavior was inconsiderate and likely unintentional, but the teacher's method of addressing it might be problematic. Passing a note about underwear could be seen as inappropriate, especially in a high school setting. It's a sensitive topic, and a note might be misinterpreted as a form of harassment or a flirtatious gesture, even if the intent was just to correct her. \n\nAlternative approaches could be better. For example, addressing it in front of the class without singling her out, maybe by reminding everyone to keep their feet on the floor. That way, it's a general rule and avoids personal notes. If he had to address it privately, maybe a verbal reminder during a break or a more formal method, ensuring it's documented if necessary. \n\nThe student's reaction and the friends' dirty looks suggest that the note was taken the wrong way. Even if the teacher's intention was to correct, the method could be perceived as a violation of privacy or inappropriate attention. The potential for a rumor to spread is real in schools, and it's not worth the risk. \n\nAlso, the teacher considered emailing her but worried about it looking bad. That shows he's aware of the sensitivity. The note might have been a hasty decision. Best practices involve maintaining professionalism and using appropriate channels. So, the answer is probably A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
