I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The teacher is asking if he's at fault for telling a student her underwear was showing. The situation involves a female student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, leading to visible underwear. The teacher tried various methods to address it without making her feel embarrassed, and finally passed a note. The student and her friends responded negatively, giving him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intent is important. He wanted to inform the student to prevent her from showing her underwear unintentionally. He considered different approaches to avoid calling her out in front of others, which shows he was trying to be respectful. The method he chose was passing a note, which seems discreet. The student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down, but then the student and her friends started giving him dirty looks, leading him to worry about rumors.\n\nNow, is the teacher in the wrong? Well, from a professional standpoint, the teacher's responsibility is to maintain a respectful and appropriate environment. The student's actions might be considered disruptive or unprofessional, but as a student, she's not an adult. However, the teacher's method of addressing it was direct but discreet. The problem arises in how the student and her peers perceived it. The teacher didn't make a public accusation, which is good. But the note might be seen as a violation of personal privacy or as inappropriate given the power dynamic between teacher and student.\n\nIn educational settings, there are strict guidelines about communication between teachers and students. Sending a note might be acceptable in some contexts, but the content (mentioning underwear) could be seen as crossing a line. The teacher's intent was to correct a wardrobe issue, which is different from harassment. However, the perception is key here. The student felt targeted, and the note could be misinterpreted as inappropriate attention. Even if the teacher's intent was pure, the method might not have been the best approach.\n\nAlternative methods could include a private conversation after class, focusing on classroom behavior rather than the specific clothing issue. The teacher could mention that certain behaviors are distracting or unprofessional, without referencing the underwear. The problem is that the teacher directly mentioned the underwear, which might not be the best way to address it, given the potential for misinterpretation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the teacher's action was well-intentioned but the method might have been inappropriate. The answer could be that the teacher is partly at fault because the approach taken could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the intent was good. However, the student's actions might also be a factor. But since the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong, the focus is on his actions. The note could be viewed as a breach of professionalism, leading to possible issues with perception and relationships. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the method of communication was inappropriate given the power dynamic.\n"
