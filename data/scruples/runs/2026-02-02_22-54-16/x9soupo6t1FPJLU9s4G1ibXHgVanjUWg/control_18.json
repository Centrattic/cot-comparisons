I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student repeatedly showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk. He tried different ways to address it\u2014passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing\"\u2014but now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks. He's worried about being seen as a creep or having his career affected.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the teacher observed a student's clothing choice and took action because he felt uncomfortable. He tried to address it discreetly without calling her out in front of others. The student's response was negative, leading to tension between them and possible rumors. The teacher isn't facing administrative issues, but is concerned about reputation.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and professional standards for teachers. Teachers have a duty to maintain appropriate boundaries with students. However, in this scenario, the teacher is addressing a legitimate concern about a student's clothing choice that's causing discomfort. The method he used was a note, which is private and direct. \n\nBut wait, there's a potential issue here. The teacher's role includes ensuring the student's well-being, but commenting on a student's clothing could be seen as overstepping if the student isn't violating any dress code. If the school has a specific dress code policy, then the teacher is following protocol. However, if there's no such policy, the teacher might be overreaching by making a personal comment about the student's attire. \n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. Teachers have authority over students, so any personal comment about a student's body can be problematic. The note could be misinterpreted, especially in the context of a male teacher addressing a female student about her clothing, which might lead to perceptions of objectification or harassment, even if the teacher's intent was benign. \n\nThe student's reaction suggests she didn't take the message well. Maybe she felt embarrassed or that the teacher was commenting on her for personal reasons. The teacher's concern about being seen as a creep is valid because of the potential misuse of his position. Even if he's not in trouble now, the situation could escalate if rumors spread, affecting his professional reputation and trust with students.\n\nIn some cases, schools have protocols for handling dress code issues. The teacher might have been better off addressing the behavior (like the feet on the desk) rather than the clothing itself. For example, pointing out the behavior that's causing the issue instead of the clothing choice. That way, it's about the action (feet on the desk) rather than the attire, which might avoid personalizing the comment.\n\nSo, considering all this, the teacher's action might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if well-intentioned. The method of communication and the content of the note could lead to misunderstandings. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong for handling it this way instead of following established school protocols or focusing on the behavior rather than the clothing.\n"
