I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the teacher did the wrong thing by telling the student her underwear was showing. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the teacher is male, the student is female. She's been wearing skirts and putting her feet up, leading to her underwear being visible. The teacher tried to ignore it at first, but then decided to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted by scoffing and putting her feet down, but now there's tension with her friends giving dirty looks. The teacher is worried about rumors and his career.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's the case. Let's consider the ethical angles here. The teacher's intention was to inform the student discreetly. The method was a note, which seems non-confrontational. However, the issue arises from the power dynamic between a teacher and student. Even if the teacher's intent was appropriate, a student might perceive the note as harassment, especially given the gender dynamics. \n\nAnother angle is the approach. Passing a note about a student's clothing could be seen as prying into a personal matter. Maybe the teacher should have addressed it in a more neutral way, like talking to her privately after class without mentioning the underwear directly. For example, asking her to adjust her position or clothing for comfort reasons, rather than pointing out the underwear specifically. That might avoid the perception of being intrusive.\n\nAlso, considering the potential for misinterpretation: a student might feel singled out or that the teacher is overstepping. The teacher's concern about being called a creep is valid because even if the action is innocent, the perception can damage the teacher's professional standing.\n\nBut on the other hand, the teacher's intention was to inform the student of an issue she didn't realize she had. It's possible the student genuinely didn't know, so the teacher was trying to help. The problem might be in how the message was delivered. \n\nIn terms of professional standards, many school policies advise against direct communication between teachers and students about personal matters via notes or emails due to the risk of misinterpretation. A better approach might have been to address the behavior (like feet on the desk) without focusing on the underwear. For example, \"Please keep your feet off the desk for everyone's comfort.\" That way, the teacher avoids commenting on the underwear and focuses on the action.\n\nSo, was the teacher in the wrong? It's a tricky case. The intent was to help, but the method might have been inappropriate given the power dynamic and potential for misunderstanding. Therefore, while the teacher might not be in the wrong in a strict sense, the approach could have been handled more professionally. The answer depends on whether the action crossed professional boundaries, which it might have. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because the method could be seen as unprofessional despite good intentions.\n"
