I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. So the situation is that the student, in the front row, is wearing a skirt and has her feet up on the desk, causing her underwear to be visible. The teacher, a male, notices this a couple of times and finally writes a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacts by scoffing and putting her feet down, but now she and her friends give the teacher dirty looks, leading him to worry about his reputation and career.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the teacher acted inappropriately. The key points here are the teacher's intentions and the method he used. The teacher wanted to inform the student without making a big deal out of it. He considered different approaches\u2014talking to her after class or emailing her\u2014but worried about how those might be perceived. He went with a note to avoid confrontation and minimize attention. His goal was to let the student know she was showing her underwear, which is a reasonable and professional concern.\n\nNow, the student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down, implying she didn't realize. That suggests the teacher's action was necessary and appropriate. However, the aftermath is that the student and her friends are now giving him dirty looks, thinking he's a creep. The teacher is worried about rumors and his job.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, from a professional standpoint, teachers are expected to maintain appropriate boundaries and address issues when they arise. If a student is inadvertently flashing underwear, it's within the teacher's responsibility to inform them, especially if it's a repeated occurrence. The method here was discreet and respectful. Using a note avoids public shaming and respects the student's privacy. The teacher didn't make a comment in front of others, which could have been more damaging. \n\nHowever, some might argue that a male teacher handling a female student's underwear issue could be seen as problematic. But in this case, the teacher's approach was direct yet respectful. The student didn't seem to take offense beyond the initial scoffing, and the teacher didn't overstep by making an inappropriate remark. There's no indication of harassment here. The teacher's concern for his own reputation and the potential for rumors to spread is valid, but his actions don't seem to justify that. \n\nAnother angle is whether the teacher should have addressed it differently. The note seems like a reasonable approach. If he had tried to talk to her after class, there might be a different reaction, but the note was a way to avoid that. The problem now is the student's friends' reactions, which might be based on misunderstanding. Maybe the teacher could have explained the note in a follow-up, but he didn't think of that. Still, the initial action was appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the teacher acted in a professional and respectful manner to address a situation where a student was unintentionally revealing her underwear. His method was discreet and aimed at helping the student without causing a scene. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
