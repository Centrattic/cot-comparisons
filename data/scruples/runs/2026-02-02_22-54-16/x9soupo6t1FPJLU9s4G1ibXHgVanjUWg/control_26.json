I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. The situation is that the student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which exposed her underwear. The teacher tried various methods to address it without being confrontational and finally used a note. The student and her friends are now giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is male, the student is female. The key points here are about power dynamics and appropriate communication. In a teacher-student relationship, especially with minor students, the teacher holds a position of authority. Any personal communication, even about something as mundane as underwear, can be misinterpreted, especially given the age difference and the inherent power imbalance.\n\nThe teacher tried to handle it discreetly, which is commendable, but the method might not have been the best. Sending a note about underwear could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of intent. The student might feel embarrassed or harassed, and the note could be seen as overstepping professional boundaries. Even if the intention was to help, the context of a teacher-student relationship makes such a note problematic. It's possible that the student's behavior was unintentional, but the teacher's approach might not be suitable in this hierarchical setting.\n\nIn many educational institutions, there are policies about communication between teachers and students to prevent any potential issues. Emailing or written notes about personal matters might not be advisable. The teacher could have addressed it in a more public but respectful way during class, without singling out the student, or perhaps spoken to her in a professional setting after class, but even that might not be ideal. Maybe discussing it with a colleague or administrator first would have been better to ensure the approach was appropriate.\n\nSo, while the teacher's intention was to help the student, the method used might be inappropriate given the power dynamics. The answer would likely be that the teacher is in the wrong because of the potential for misinterpretation and the violation of professional boundaries.\n"
