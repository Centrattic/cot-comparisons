I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a male high school teacher who's asking if he's in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. The situation involves a female student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, exposing her underwear. The teacher tried several methods to address it without confrontation, finally using a note. Now, the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, making him worry about his job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is trying to address a situation where a student is inadvertently exposing her underwear. He's concerned about professional boundaries and not wanting to make the student uncomfortable. He used various methods to avoid a direct confrontation, which is understandable in a school setting. The note was a direct but discreet way to inform her.\n\nNow, was he in the wrong? Well, the act of pointing out the underwear showing is a reasonable response to a student who might not realize the issue. The teacher's intention was to help, not to harass. However, the method of communication (a note) might be seen as inappropriate in some contexts, especially given the power dynamic between a teacher and a student. Even if the intent was good, the message could be misinterpreted, especially in the current climate where interactions between teachers and students are scrutinized.\n\nThe student's reaction (scoffing and putting her feet down) suggests she understood the note's message, but the aftermath of dirty looks from her and friends indicates a possible misunderstanding or a feeling of being targeted. The teacher's concern about rumors is valid because even if he's not in the wrong, the perception could harm his career. \n\nHowever, the key point is whether his actions crossed professional boundaries. The teacher's action was to address a situation where a student might not be aware of her appearance, which is a legitimate concern. But using a direct note might not be the best approach. Alternative methods, like addressing it in front of the class (if appropriate) or using a more formal method (like a private meeting with a colleague present) might have been better. \n\nBut the question is specifically whether he is in the wrong. Since his intention was to inform the student politely and discreetly, and there's no indication of harassment or impropriety, he's probably not in the wrong. The student's reaction is a separate issue. The answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because the intent was appropriate, and he tried to handle it without confrontation. However, there's room for better handling the situation in the future to avoid misunderstandings.\n"
