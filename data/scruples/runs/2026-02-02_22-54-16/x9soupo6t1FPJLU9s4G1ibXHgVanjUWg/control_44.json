I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the teacher noticed a female student was flashing her underwear by having her feet on the desk. He tried ignoring it, then she kept doing it. He passed her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his job and reputation.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether he acted appropriately. Let's break it down. The teacher's intention was to stop the student from unknowingly flashing her underwear. He considered different methods\u2014talking to her after class, emailing, but decided to pass a note. The note was direct and to the point, but maybe too blunt? \n\nNow, from the student's perspective, receiving a note from a male teacher about her underwear could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of intent. Even if he meant to help, the message might have been misinterpreted. There's a power dynamic here: a teacher communicating with a student about personal clothing in a classroom setting. Passing a note about such a private matter could be seen as overstepping professional boundaries. \n\nAlso, the way he handled it\u2014suddenly pointing it out publicly (even if via a note) might have embarrassed the student, leading to her resentment. The student might feel targeted or harassed, even if unintended. In some cases, this could lead to accusations of misconduct, even if the teacher's intent was good. \n\nHowever, the teacher did consider other options and tried to avoid calling her out in front of others. The note was a discreet method compared to publicly addressing her. But the content of the note is the issue. \"Your underwear is showing\" is very direct and could be perceived as a sexual comment, especially coming from a teacher to a student. \n\nSchool policies often have strict guidelines about communication between teachers and students, especially regarding personal matters. Even if the teacher's intention was to correct an unintentional wardrobe malfunction, the method might not align with professional standards. Teachers are supposed to maintain a certain level of decorum and avoid situations where their communications could be misinterpreted.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though the teacher's intention was to help, the manner in which he communicated it could be seen as inappropriate. The student and her friends perceiving him as a creep suggests that the action had a negative impact on the classroom environment. There's a risk of it being reported as a harassment incident, which could jeopardize his career despite his good intentions.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the method of communication was inappropriate given the professional relationship between a teacher and a student. Even if the intent was good, the approach crossed professional boundaries.\n"
