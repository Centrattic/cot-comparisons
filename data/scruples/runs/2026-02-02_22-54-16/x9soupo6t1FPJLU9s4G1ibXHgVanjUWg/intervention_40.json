I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the teacher is a male high school teacher, and a female student keeps showing her underwear by putting her feet up on the desk when wearing skirts. The teacher tried different ways to address it\u2014ignoring it at first, considering talking to her after class or emailing, but finally passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted with scoffing and put her feet down, but now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors and his career.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher's intention was to address a situation where a student was unknowingly flashing her underwear, which could be considered inappropriate in a school setting. The teacher tried to handle it discreetly to avoid embarrassing the student or drawing attention. The note was a direct but private way to inform her. \n\nNow, the question is whether the teacher overstepped. On one hand, pointing out that a student's underwear is visible could be seen as a reasonable action to correct an accidental wardrobe malfunction. On the other hand, some might argue that a male teacher communicating with a female student about such a personal matter, even if done discreetly, could lead to misunderstandings or inappropriate perceptions, especially given the power dynamic in a teacher-student relationship.\n\nBut the teacher did try other methods first, like ignoring it, and only resorted to the note after repeated incidents. The note was brief and to the point, not containing any personal or suggestive content. The problem now is the student's reaction and the potential for rumors, which the teacher is concerned about. \n\nLegally and ethically, teachers are expected to maintain professional boundaries. However, in this case, the teacher's action was aimed at correcting a clothing issue that the student might not have noticed, which is a common occurrence. The method used was private and non-invasive. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that the teacher should have addressed it by speaking to the student in private, rather than using a note, to ensure the message was clear and to avoid any misinterpretation. However, the teacher did consider that option but was worried about the student's friends getting involved or the email being delayed. The note was an attempt to handle it without involving others or causing a scene.\n\nIn terms of professional conduct, if the school has policies on such matters, the teacher might be within guidelines if they acted in good faith. The fact that the administration hasn't contacted him suggests that they don't see a problem, which supports the idea that he's in the right.\n\nSo, considering all that, the teacher's intention was to help the student without embarrassing her, and the method was as discreet as possible. The student's reaction and the subsequent rumors are more about how the student and her peers perceive the situation, but the teacher's action itself doesn't seem to be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
