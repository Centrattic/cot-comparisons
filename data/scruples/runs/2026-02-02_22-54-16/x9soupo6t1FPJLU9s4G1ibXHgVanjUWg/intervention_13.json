I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe teacher is male, and a female student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried different ways to address it\u2014like waiting, considering email, but finally gave a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student scoffed and put her feet down, but now the teacher is facing dirty looks from her and her friends. The teacher is worried about rumors and his career.\n\nFirst, the teacher noticed the issue and tried various methods to address it without causing a scene. The student might not have been aware of her clothing showing. The note was direct but probably necessary. The teacher didn't report the student or make a big deal out of it in front of others, which is good. However, passing a note about underwear showing could be seen as inappropriate because it's a private matter. But the teacher's intent was to inform the student, not to harass. \n\nThe problem is that the student and her friends now view the teacher as a creep. The teacher might not be in the wrong because he was trying to correct a clothing issue. But maybe the method wasn't the best. Maybe he should have spoken to the student privately after class instead of a note. However, the teacher considered other options like email but thought it might look bad. \n\nIn terms of professionalism, teachers are expected to handle such situations discreetly. The note was a quick solution. The teacher didn't act on the situation in a way that's inappropriate. The student's reaction might be due to misunderstanding. So, the teacher might not be in the wrong, but maybe the approach could have been better. However, given the options he considered, the note was a reasonable attempt. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
