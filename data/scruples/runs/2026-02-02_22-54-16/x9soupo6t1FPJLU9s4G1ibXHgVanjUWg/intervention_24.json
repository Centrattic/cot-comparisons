I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The teacher is male, and a female student keeps sitting in the front row, wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which causes her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried to ignore it at first but then decided to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student scoffed and put her feet down, but now she and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors and his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between a teacher and a student. It's important that the teacher maintains professionalism. The student's behavior could be unintentional, but the teacher has a responsibility to address it in a way that's appropriate. The question is, did the teacher handle it correctly?\n\nHe considered several methods: talking to her after class, emailing, but ultimately went with a note. Passing a note about underwear might come across as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamics. Even if the intention was innocent, the message could be misinterpreted. The student might feel embarrassed or offended, and the other students might start rumors. The fact that the student and her friends are now giving him dirty looks suggests that the approach might have been awkward or not well-received.\n\nIn a professional setting, it's usually better to address such issues in a private, respectful manner. Instead of a note, maybe a brief, discreet conversation after class where he could mention the clothing choice without being accusatory. However, the teacher's intention was to inform her without embarrassing her, which is understandable. But the method chosen might have led to unintended consequences.\n\nAnother angle: the teacher's concern about maintaining a good rapport and avoiding rumors is valid. The school's policies might also have guidelines on how to handle such situations. If there's no mention of formal complaints, maybe it's not a policy violation, but perception matters in these cases. The teacher's age and the student's age are both within a high school context, so the teacher needs to ensure his actions don't invite any suspicion or gossip.\n\nIn summary, while the teacher's intention was to correct an unintentional issue, the method of using a note might have been inappropriate. A more direct but private approach might have been better to avoid misunderstandings and maintain professionalism. So, the answer might be that the teacher is in the wrong because the method he chose could be seen as inappropriate given the context.\n"
