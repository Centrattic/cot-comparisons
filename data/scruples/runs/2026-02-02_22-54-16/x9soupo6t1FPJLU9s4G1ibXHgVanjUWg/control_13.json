I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a male teacher who noticed a female student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to show. He tried to handle it by passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" which led to the student and her friends giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The teacher wanted to address the issue without making the student uncomfortable or causing a scene. He tried different methods like email or holding her after class but found them problematic. The note seems like a direct but discreet approach.\n\nBut wait, is it appropriate for a teacher to comment on a student's clothing? Teachers are supposed to maintain professional boundaries. Even if the teacher's intention was to help, the student might perceive it as inappropriate. The student's reaction\u2014scoffing and putting her feet down\u2014could indicate she was embarrassed or didn't take it seriously. The subsequent dirty looks suggest that the classmates might have misinterpreted the note as the teacher making a lewd comment.\n\nAlso, the teacher's concern about rumors and career impact shows he's aware of potential issues. However, the act of commenting on a student's underwear, regardless of intent, can be seen as crossing a professional line. There's a risk of misunderstanding, and in some cases, it could lead to accusations of harassment or inappropriate behavior.\n\nI should also consider school policies and guidelines. Many schools have strict rules about communication between teachers and students. Sending a note about personal appearance might not be the best approach. The teacher might have been better advised to address it through a more formal channel, perhaps involving the student's parents or school administration, especially if the behavior was recurring and causing a distraction.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher did try to handle it privately and respectfully, avoiding public embarrassment. His intent was to correct a situation where a student might not be aware of her appearance. But the method he chose, while direct, might not align with professional standards.\n\nIn conclusion, while the teacher's intention was to help, the action taken could be seen as inappropriate given the power dynamics and the potential for misinterpretation. The correct approach might have been to address it through school protocols rather than a personal note. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the teacher is in the wrong).\n"
