I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the male teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. The situation is that the student was wearing a skirt, put her feet up, and the teacher passed a note saying her underwear was showing. The student and her friends now give him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher tried to handle it discreetly because he didn't want to embarrass the student or cause a scene. He tried different methods like holding her after class or emailing but worried about how it might look. Passing a note seems like a private way to address it. \n\nBut then, the student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down. Now, the classmates are giving him dirty looks, thinking he's a creep. The teacher is worried about his reputation and career. \n\nFrom a professional standpoint, teachers are expected to maintain appropriate boundaries. However, the teacher's action was to correct a situation where the student was unknowingly exposing her underwear. The intent seems to be to help her, not to make a sexual remark. \n\nBut there's a risk in how it's perceived. Even if the intention was good, the message could be misinterpreted. The way he communicated it might not have been the best approach. Maybe he should have addressed it in a more formal setting, like after class, to avoid any misunderstanding. \n\nHowever, the student's behavior was the initial issue. She was consistently showing her underwear, and the teacher was trying to correct that without public humiliation. The note was direct but brief. \n\nI think the key here is the intent versus the perception. The teacher's intent was to inform her, but the note might have been seen as inappropriate because it's a private matter. The students' reaction suggests they perceived it as a creepy action. \n\nBut the teacher did try to handle it discreetly and only after several instances. Schools have policies on student conduct, so maybe he should have reported it through the proper channels instead of handling it himself. However, if he didn't report it and just addressed it directly, that might be acceptable as well. \n\nIn some cases, passing a note about a student's private clothing might be considered unprofessional, regardless of intent. The teacher might have violated some school policies on student-teacher interactions. \n\nOn the other hand, the teacher's action was to correct the student's clothing, which is a common issue. The problem is how it was done. Maybe he should have used a more formal method, like speaking to her after class with witnesses present to avoid any appearance of impropriety. \n\nSo, the teacher is not in the wrong in terms of intent, but the method might have been unwise. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the note was the only action and there's no policy violation mentioned, then perhaps he's not in the wrong. But if the school's policies require certain procedures for such matters, then he might be in the wrong. \n\nSince the user says the teacher hasn't been contacted by superiors, maybe the school doesn't see it as a problem. But the perception from the students is that he's a creep, which is a concern. \n\nOverall, the answer might be B, the teacher is not in the wrong because the intent was to correct the student's attire, but the approach could have been better.\n"
