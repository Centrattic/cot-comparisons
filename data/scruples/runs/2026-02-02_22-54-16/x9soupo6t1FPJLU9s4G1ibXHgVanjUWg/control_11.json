I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher saw a student's underwear because she had her feet up on the desk. He passed a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student and her friends now give him dirty looks, thinking he's a creep.\n\nFirst, the teacher's intention was to inform the student without making her uncomfortable. He tried different methods but opted for a note. However, from the student's perspective, receiving a note about underwear from a male teacher could be seen as inappropriate. Even if the teacher's intent was good, the message might be misinterpreted. The student's reaction of scoffing and then the friends giving dirty looks suggests that the note could have made her feel embarrassed or that the teacher was being inconsiderate. The main issue here is the potential for a power dynamic and the perception of inappropriateness. Even if there's no formal complaint, the teacher's actions might have crossed a boundary, regardless of intent. So, the answer is A.\n"
