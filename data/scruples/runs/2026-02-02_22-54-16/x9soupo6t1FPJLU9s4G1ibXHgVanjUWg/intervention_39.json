I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The teacher wrote a question about whether he did something wrong by telling a student her underwear was showing. The student was wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, revealing her underwear. The teacher tried different ways to approach it, like holding her back or emailing, but finally used a note. The student and her friends now give him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the teacher acted in the wrong. The key points here are about appropriateness and boundaries. The teacher is male, the student is female, and the situation involved a student's wardrobe choice. The teacher's intention was to correct something the student might not be aware of, but the method led to tension.\n\nIn a professional setting, teachers should avoid situations that could be misinterpreted, especially with students of the opposite sex. However, the teacher's action was to point out something the student might not realize. The note was direct and to the point. But the problem here could be the nature of the communication. Teachers need to be cautious about personal communication with students, especially when it's about physical appearance. Even if the intention was good, it might look inappropriate from an outside perspective.\n\nAnother angle is the student's behavior. If she was deliberately showing her underwear, then the teacher's action is a response to that. However, the teacher assumed she wasn't aware, which might be a valid assumption. Still, the method of communication could be an issue. Using a note might be seen as a breach of professional boundaries, especially if it's about a student's clothing.\n\nSchool policies often have guidelines about interactions between teachers and students. Even if the teacher didn't violate any rules, the perception is important. The reaction from the student and her friends indicates that the action was taken as a personal slight or inappropriate. The teacher's concern about rumors and career impact shows he's aware of the potential for misinterpretation.\n\nIn many cases, the correct approach would be to address the behavior in a professional manner, perhaps during class time, but avoiding personal comments about attire. Alternatively, the teacher could have addressed the behavior without focusing on the underwear, such as asking her to keep her feet on the desk, which might have avoided the personal nature of the note.\n\nConsidering all this, the teacher's action, while well-intentioned, might be seen as crossing a line because it focused on the student's undergarments, which can be a sensitive topic. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance here. However, since the teacher's action was to point out something the student wasn't aware of in a direct but discreet way, some might argue it's not wrong. But given the potential for misinterpretation and the reaction, the correct answer might be A.\n"
