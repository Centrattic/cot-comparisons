I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher sees a student's underwear because she's sitting with her feet up on the desk. He tries multiple ways to address it without being confrontational\u2014like passing a note. The student reacts, but her friends give him dirty looks. The question is whether the teacher is at fault.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a teacher noticing a student's undergarments. The key here is intent. The teacher's intention was to inform the student politely without making her feel embarrassed. The student's behavior might be unintentional; maybe she didn't realize. So passing a note was a discreet attempt.\n\nNow, societal norms. In many places, it's acceptable for a teacher to address such a situation in a respectful manner. The note was short and to the point, avoiding any personal or inappropriate language. The teacher didn't make a public spectacle, which is important for maintaining the student's dignity.\n\nPossible issues: Could the note be seen as inappropriate? The teacher is male, the student is female. However, the content of the note is professional and necessary. There's no indication of harassment here. The teacher is addressing a clothing issue, not making any unwelcome advances.\n\nLegal and professional standards. Teachers are expected to handle such situations appropriately. Since there's no report of any formal complaint, the school likely sees it as handled correctly. The teacher's actions were within his role to maintain a respectful environment.\n\nBut wait, some might argue that a male teacher addressing a female student's clothing could be problematic, even if well-intentioned. However, the method used was non-invasive and discreet. The alternative methods (email, holding after class) had their own issues. The note was the most direct way without involving others.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the teacher acted in a professional manner. The student's reaction and her friends' behavior might be due to misunderstanding, but that doesn't mean the teacher was wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
