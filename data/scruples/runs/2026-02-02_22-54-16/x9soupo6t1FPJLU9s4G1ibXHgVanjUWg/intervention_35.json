I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. The situation involves a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried multiple ways to address it without confronting her directly, finally passing a note. Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's actions. He noticed the student's clothing and her habit of putting her feet up, which led to her underwear being visible. He tried different methods to address it discreetly. Passing a note seems like a respectful approach. He didn't make a public confrontation, which could have embarrassed the student. He also considered the potential for rumors but took a private route. \n\nOn the other side, the student might feel embarrassed or targeted. Maybe she didn't realize she was showing her underwear each time. The teacher's note, while straightforward, could be seen as intrusive. But his intention was to inform her, not to harass. The fact that the student scoffed and then put her feet down suggests she understood the message. \n\nLegally and ethically, teachers are responsible for maintaining a professional environment. If a student's clothing is revealing, the teacher has a duty to address it. However, the method is important. A private, straightforward communication is appropriate. The teacher's actions here seem to fit that. \n\nPossible issues could be if the note was written in a way that could be misinterpreted, but the note just said \"your underwear is showing,\" which is direct and professional. The teacher also considered alternatives like email or holding her back, which might have been more problematic. \n\nThe student's reaction might be due to feeling embarrassed or thinking the teacher is overstepping, but the teacher's intent was to correct a situation he's had to address multiple times. Since there's no mention of any policy violation by the teacher, and he acted in a professional manner, it's more likely he's in the right. The student's friends taking sides might be due to not understanding the context. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (No, the teacher is not in the wrong).\n"
