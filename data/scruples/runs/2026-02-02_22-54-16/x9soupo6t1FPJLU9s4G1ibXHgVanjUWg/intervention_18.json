I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is a male high school teacher who had a situation where a female student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up on the desk, causing her underwear to show. He tried to handle it by passing her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now, the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about his reputation and career.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he's in the wrong. The main points to consider are: the teacher's intent, the method he used, and the context of the situation. \n\nThe teacher observed this behavior multiple times and tried to address it without embarrassing the student. He considered different approaches like holding her after class or emailing but decided against them due to potential awkwardness or misinterpretation. Instead, he chose a private note, which seems like a reasonable way to inform her without public shaming.\n\nHowever, there are some nuances. The teacher's gender and the student's gender might influence perceptions. In some contexts, a male teacher addressing a female student about her clothing could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the student is a minor. Even if the intent was to inform her, the act of a teacher pointing out a student's underwear could be misinterpreted, regardless of the method used.\n\nAnother angle is the school's policies. Some schools have strict guidelines about teacher-student interactions, especially regarding personal matters. If the teacher didn't follow the proper protocol\u2014like involving a female colleague or using a more formal approach\u2014it could be seen as mishandling the situation. \n\nAlso, the student's reaction: she scoffed and put her feet down, which might suggest she didn't take the note seriously or felt targeted. The subsequent dirty looks from her and friends could indicate that the method didn't work well and might have caused resentment or gossip. \n\nBut from the teacher's perspective, trying to handle it discreetly is understandable. He didn't want to embarrass her publicly, which is commendable. The key is whether the action crossed a boundary. If the teacher acted with no malicious intent and in a non-harassment way, then maybe he's not at fault. However, the context of a teacher-student relationship, where power dynamics are present, can make even well-meaning actions problematic. \n\nIn some cases, the act of a teacher pointing out a student's clothing might be seen as overstepping, especially if there's no prior report of the behavior to the school. The teacher might have assumed the responsibility to address it, but in a school setting, that might not be his role unless there's a specific dress code violation. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the teacher's intention was to inform the student politely, but the action could be perceived as invasive or inappropriate in a professional setting. Therefore, there's a possibility that the teacher is in the wrong due to the inherent power imbalance and potential for misinterpretation.\n"
