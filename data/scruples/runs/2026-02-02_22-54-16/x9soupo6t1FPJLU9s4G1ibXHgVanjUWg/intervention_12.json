I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing.\n\nFirst, the situation: The teacher is male, the student is a female upperclassman. She's wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which causes her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried to ignore it at first, but after multiple instances, he decided to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down, but then she and her friends gave him dirty looks. The teacher is worried about rumors and his reputation.\n\nNow, considering the context. The teacher's intention was to inform the student politely and discreetly. The method chosen was a note during class, which might be seen as the least confrontational approach. The student might have been unaware of her appearance, so the teacher's action was to help her avoid embarrassment. However, the problem is the perception from the students. The teacher is an adult, and any communication about a student's clothing could be misinterpreted, especially in today's climate where teacher-student interactions are scrutinized.\n\nBut the teacher did take steps to avoid confrontation: didn't call her out in front of others, didn't email, didn't involve others. He used a note as a private way to let her know. The student's response suggests she wasn't aware, so the teacher was trying to be respectful. However, the social dynamics might have led to the students perceiving it as harassment or inappropriate attention. The key here is whether the action was necessary and professional.\n\nAnother angle: The teacher's concern about rumors and career impact is valid. Even if the intent was good, the message could be seen as crossing a boundary. Maybe the teacher should have considered other methods, like a subtle non-verbal cue or addressing it in a more formal setting. But the note was direct and to the point, and it worked in stopping the behavior.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the teacher's action might not be legally wrong, but there's a potential for professional misconduct depending on school policies. Some schools have strict guidelines about communication with students. However, the teacher's approach was to inform her discreetly, which is a common way to handle such situations. The student's reaction indicates she understood the message, so the teacher's intent was appropriate.\n\nBut there's a risk in the perception. Even if the teacher's actions were justified, the student and her peers might not see it that way. So maybe the teacher should have handled it differently, but not necessarily in the wrong. The question is whether he was in the wrong, so based on the information, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with a note that the method could be improved.\n"
