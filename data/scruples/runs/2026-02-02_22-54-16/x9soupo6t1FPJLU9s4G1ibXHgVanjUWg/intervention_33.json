I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher did the wrong thing by telling a student her underwear was showing. The teacher passed a note with \"your underwear is showing\" when the student was wearing a skirt and had her feet up on the desk. The student then scoffed, but now the teacher is getting dirty looks from her and her friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is male, the student is a female upperclassman. The student had this habit of wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried different ways to address it but finally went with a note. Now, the student and her friends are upset, thinking the teacher is a creep.\n\nThe teacher's intention was to inform the student without embarrassing her publicly. He considered after-school meetings or emails but worried about potential misinterpretations. The note was direct but brief. The problem is whether this action crossed a line.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, teachers have a duty to maintain appropriate boundaries. However, pointing out something like visible underwear could be seen as necessary, especially if the student is unaware. The method of using a note might be less intrusive than other methods. However, the note itself could be perceived as inappropriate given the teacher-student relationship. The fact that the student and her friends now view the teacher as a creep suggests that the note might have been misinterpreted or caused unintended discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher's actions were to correct an issue the student wasn't aware of, which could be considered respectful. The key here is the appropriateness of the method. Some might argue that the note was necessary and professional, while others might think it's an invasion of privacy or inappropriate for a teacher to comment on a student's undergarments.\n\nThe fact that the school hasn't taken action against him is a point in his favor. But the potential for rumors and the impact on his reputation are concerns. The teacher's main mistake might be not considering that the message could be misinterpreted, even if his intention was good.\n\nIn summary, while the teacher's intention was to help, the method might have been problematic given the power dynamic. However, he might not be entirely in the wrong. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The key is whether the action was professional and appropriate. Since the note was direct and not sexual in nature (just stating the fact), and the school hasn't reprimanded him, it leans towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
