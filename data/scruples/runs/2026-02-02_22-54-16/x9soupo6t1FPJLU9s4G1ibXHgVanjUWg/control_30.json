I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, causing her underwear to be visible. He tried ignoring it at first, but when it kept happening, he decided to pass her a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted with a scoff and put her feet down, but now she and her friends give him dirty looks, making him worry about his reputation and career.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the teacher acted inappropriately. The student was the one showing her underwear, which is a matter of personal appearance. However, the teacher's response was a note pointing it out. The question is if that was the wrong approach.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, teachers are expected to maintain appropriate boundaries with students. Directly commenting on a student's clothing, especially in a one-on-one note, could be seen as overstepping. Even if the intention was to correct the student's attire, the method might come across as intrusive or uncomfortable for the student. It could also lead to misunderstandings, as the student might feel embarrassed or targeted.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. As a teacher, he holds authority over the student, so any personal comment about her appearance might be viewed as inappropriate, regardless of intent. There are established protocols for handling such situations, like contacting the student's parents or referring to the school's dress code policy. Sending a note directly to the student might not align with those protocols.\n\nAdditionally, the teacher's concern about rumors and his reputation suggests that he might not have considered the potential fallout. The student's reaction with friends giving him dirty looks indicates that the approach might have been misjudged. The teacher could have handled it through the school's administrative channels instead of taking a direct, personal approach.\n\nIn summary, while the teacher's intention was to address an issue, the method he used might not have been appropriate given the professional boundaries and the potential for misinterpretation. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the teacher being in the wrong.\n"
