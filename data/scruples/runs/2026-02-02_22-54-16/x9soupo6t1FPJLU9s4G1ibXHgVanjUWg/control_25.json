I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student showing her underwear multiple times. He tried different ways to address it without making her uncomfortable, like passing a note. But now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nFirst, the situation: The student was wearing skirts and putting her feet up, showing underwear. The teacher didn't want to embarrass her or make her explain why he held her back. He used a note to inform her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nLegally and ethically, teachers have a duty to address inappropriate behavior, but must do so appropriately. The teacher's actions seem to be in response to a student's unintentional wardrobe malfunction. Since the student was not aware, the teacher's note was a direct but discreet way to inform her without public embarrassment. It's important to consider the power dynamic here\u2014the teacher is an authority figure, but the note was a simple, non-confrontational method.\n\nHowever, potential issues could be: the teacher's communication might have been misinterpreted, leading to the student and friends perceiving it as harassment. Also, the method of passing a note might not have been the best approach. Alternatives could include a private conversation after class or during office hours, ensuring the student isn't in front of friends, which might reduce the stigma.\n\nBut in this case, the teacher tried to be respectful and avoid public embarrassment. The note was straightforward. The problem might be more about the student's reaction and possible misunderstandings rather than the teacher's intent. Since there's no indication of harassment or inappropriate actions from the teacher, he's likely not in the wrong. The key points are that the teacher acted in good faith to correct a wardrobe malfunction and maintained professionalism without overstepping. The student's reaction might stem from personal feelings or misinterpretation, but the teacher's actions don't cross ethical boundaries here.\n"
