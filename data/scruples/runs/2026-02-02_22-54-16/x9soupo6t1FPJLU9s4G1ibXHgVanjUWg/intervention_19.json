I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the teacher is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a male teacher noticed a female student wearing a skirt and had her feet up on the desk, showing her underwear. He tried to handle it by passing a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted by scoffing and putting her feet down, but now her friends are giving him dirty looks, making him worry about his reputation and job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and appropriateness of the teacher's actions. The teacher is a 30-year-old male, and the student is a female upperclassman. The key points here are: is the teacher crossing a boundary by pointing out the underwear issue? How is the student's behavior, putting her feet up, perceived in a classroom setting?\n\nIn a school environment, teachers have a responsibility to maintain a respectful and appropriate classroom. Students are expected to dress in a way that's not distracting. If a student is showing underwear, that could be considered a dress code violation. However, the method of addressing it might be the issue here. \n\nThe teacher passed a note to the student. While the intention was to inform her without embarrassing her publicly, the note's content could be seen as inappropriate. The phrase \"your underwear is showing\" is direct and personal, and given the teacher-student relationship, especially between a male teacher and a female student, this might be misinterpreted. Even though the teacher's intention was to correct a dress code issue, the method could lead to misunderstandings. \n\nAnother angle is the student's behavior. If she's intentionally putting her feet up, maybe she's aware of the visibility but doesn't care. Or maybe she's unaware. Either way, the teacher's approach needs to be professional. Sending a note might be seen as overstepping because it's a personal message that could be perceived as harassment, especially if the student feels targeted. \n\nAlso, the teacher considered other methods like talking to her after class or emailing but chose the note instead. The note might have been a way to avoid confrontation, but it's still a direct message about a very personal matter. In some contexts, this could be viewed as inappropriate communication, regardless of intent. \n\nThe fact that the student and her friends now give him dirty looks suggests that the message was received as creepy or harassing. The teacher's concern about rumors is valid because in schools, any personal interaction between a teacher and student can be scrutinized, and even a well-meaning note can be misinterpreted. \n\nAnother consideration is whether the teacher should have addressed it through the school's existing protocols. Maybe he should have spoken to the student in private during office hours, or reported the repeated dress code violations to the appropriate authorities instead of handling it himself. That way, it's on record and follows school procedures, reducing the risk of personal bias or misinterpretation. \n\nAlso, the teacher's options involved trying to avoid calling her out, which is understandable, but the note might not be the best approach. Teachers are supposed to enforce dress codes, but the way they do it matters. A more standard approach would be to ask the student to adjust her clothing in a professional manner, without making it personal or sending messages that could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nIn summary, while the teacher's intention was to correct a dress code violation, the method he chose\u2014passing a personal note about the student's undergarments\u2014could be seen as crossing a professional boundary. This might lead to perceptions of harassment or inappropriate behavior, even if unintended. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong for not handling it through more formal or standard procedures.\n"
