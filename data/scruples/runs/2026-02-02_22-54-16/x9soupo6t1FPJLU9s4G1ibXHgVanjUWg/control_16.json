I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The teacher is a male high school teacher, and a female student kept sitting with her feet up, showing her underwear. He tried different ways to address it but ended up passing a note saying her underwear was showing. Now the students are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about the situation and how he handled it. The student was repeatedly flashing her underwear, which the teacher found uncomfortable. The teacher didn't want to call her out directly and tried a note instead. \n\nIs it appropriate for a teacher to address this kind of situation? Well, yes. If a student is unknowingly showing underwear, it's a reasonable concern. But the method of addressing it might be questionable. Passing a note in front of others could be seen as awkward or inappropriate, even if it's the teacher's way of being discreet. However, the note was direct and to the point. \n\nBut there's a power dynamic here. A teacher giving a note about a student's underwear, especially in a way that others might see, could be misinterpreted. However, the intention was to inform her, not to harass. The student's reaction was to scoff and put her feet down, which suggests she might not have realized it before. \n\nNow, considering the backlash from her friends, maybe the way the note was delivered or the content was seen as intrusive. However, the teacher's intent was to stop the behavior, not to invade privacy. \n\nIn terms of policy, schools usually have guidelines on how to handle such situations. The teacher might have been within his rights to address it, but the method could be questioned. Some might argue that he should have spoken to her privately after class instead of a note. But he was concerned about calling her out in front of friends or using email. \n\nAlso, the fact that no superiors have said anything might indicate he's not in trouble. But the social fallout is a concern. The main issue is whether his action crossed a boundary. \n\nIn summary, while the teacher had a valid reason to address the situation, the method might not have been the best. However, he wasn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
