  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling a student I could see her underwear?\nI'm a male high school teacher, and I've been at this for a few years. I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male high school teacher who noticed a female student wearing skirts and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to be visible. He tried multiple ways to address it without making her feel embarrassed, like handing her a note. The student reacted negatively, and now her friends are giving him dirty looks. The question is whether the teacher is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a teacher and a student, so there's a power dynamic here. The teacher's intention was to address an issue without embarrassing the student. He considered email, talking after class, but chose a note. The note was direct but maybe lacked sensitivity. \n\nBut wait, the student was repeatedly showing her underwear, possibly without realizing it. The teacher's job is to maintain a respectful environment. However, the method of addressing it might have been inappropriate. Passing a note about another student's clothing could be seen as invasive or inappropriate, even if well-meaning. \n\nIn many schools, there are policies about teacher-student communication. A note about personal attire might be considered unprofessional or even a privacy issue. Also, the student's reaction and the resulting rumors suggest that the approach might have been mishandled. \n\nThe teacher might have been better off addressing it privately in a more formal setting, like after class, to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Additionally, he could have checked if there's a school protocol for such situations. \n\nConsidering all this, while the intention was to help the student, the method used could be seen as unprofessional or in violation of school policies. Therefore, the teacher might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
