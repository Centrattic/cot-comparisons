I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So the situation is a male teacher notices a female student is showing her underwear multiple times by putting her feet up in a skirt. He passes her a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" and now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is a male, the student is a female upperclassman. He's been trying different ways to address the issue without making it awkward for her or causing trouble. He tried ignoring it at first, then considered holding her after class but worried about how it might look. Emailing her was another option but he was concerned about the perception. Finally, he used a note during class, which seems discreet. \n\nNow, the key points here are: Is the teacher's action appropriate? The student was repeatedly showing her underwear, which the teacher found uncomfortable. He wants to address it without being confrontational. The note method seems to be the least invasive. \n\nBut then, the student and her friends are now giving him dirty looks. Maybe they think he's being inappropriate. But the teacher's intention was to help her without embarrassment. However, in a school setting, there are protocols and boundaries. Even though the student is an upperclassman, she's still a minor. The teacher's job is to maintain a professional distance. \n\nWait, but the teacher was trying to correct her behavior in a respectful way. The note is a direct but private method. But in some schools, even a note about personal appearance might be seen as crossing a line, especially with a student. The problem is that even if he had good intentions, the perception is that he's commenting on her body in a way that could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the fact that she kept doing it after wearing different clothes suggests that maybe she wasn't aware. So the teacher's action was to inform her. But the response from the students is negative, which might indicate that the method was not well-received. However, the teacher didn't do anything overtly wrong from a policy standpoint. \n\nBut maybe the teacher should have approached it through the school's established channels, like talking to the student in private after class with a parent present, or involving the administration. However, the teacher was trying to avoid causing a scene or making the student uncomfortable. It's a tricky situation. \n\nThe teacher's main fault, if any, could be not following the school's protocol for handling such situations. Some schools have strict guidelines about teacher-student interactions regarding personal appearance. However, if there's no policy violation, and the teacher's intent was to help the student, then it's hard to say he's in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, even if the intent is good, the act of commenting on a student's undergarments, regardless of the method, could be seen as inappropriate, especially from a male teacher. There's a risk of being misunderstood, even if the intention was to correct her behavior. \n\nSo, considering all this, the teacher might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action itself is questionable in a professional setting. However, since the school didn't take any action against him, it might mean that his approach was acceptable. But the lingering issue is the potential for misperception and the impact on his professional reputation. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the action crosses professional boundaries. Since the teacher acted in a respectful and private manner to address a repeated issue, he might not be in the wrong. However, the method of using a note might be seen as unprofessional by some. \n\nBut I think in this context, the teacher's intention was to correct the student's behavior without embarrassment, and he used a discreet method. So the answer is B, the teacher is not in the wrong.\n"
