I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The teacher is a male in a high school setting. The student is a female upperclassman who was sitting in front, wearing a skirt, and putting her feet up on the desk, which caused her underwear to be visible. The teacher tried to ignore it initially but noticed it happening repeatedly. He then decided to pass her a note saying \"your underwear is showing,\" which led to the student and her friends giving him dirty looks and potential rumors.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the teacher acted appropriately. The situation involves a student's clothing and a possible breach of professional boundaries. The teacher's intention was to inform the student without embarrassment, but the method might be problematic. \n\nIn many schools, there are strict policies about communication between teachers and students, especially regarding personal matters. A note about underwear could be seen as overly personal or inappropriate. Even if the teacher's intent was to help, the method might not be suitable. \n\nAdditionally, there's a power dynamic here. The teacher is an adult in a position of authority, and the student is a minor. Any interaction that could be perceived as focusing on the student's body or clothing in a private manner might be flagged, regardless of intent. \n\nThe student and her friends now view the teacher as a creep, which is a significant issue for maintaining a professional classroom environment. The teacher might have caused a misunderstanding or created a situation where he's vulnerable to accusations. \n\nEven though the student might not have been aware of the issue, the teacher's approach could be seen as outside the norm. Maybe a more appropriate method would be to address it during a class discussion about appropriate dress or to talk to her in a public, professional setting without making it personal. \n\nThe fact that the student continued to wear skirts and put her feet up after being told once suggests that the teacher's initial note wasn't effective. However, the way he handled it could still be problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, while the teacher's intention wasn't malicious, the method of communication and the nature of the message likely crossed a professional boundary, leading to the student's perception of him as inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is probably A.\n"
