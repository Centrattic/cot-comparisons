I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a male high school teacher who's asking if he's in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing. The situation involves a female student wearing skirts and putting her feet up on the desk, which causes her underwear to be visible. He tried different methods to address it, like handing her a note. Now the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors affecting his career.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the teacher did something inappropriate. The student was repeatedly showing her underwear, which is a privacy issue. The teacher's intention was to inform her, which is understandable. But how he went about it might be the problem. Handing a note with \"your underwear is showing\" could be seen as a breach of privacy or even as a form of harassment, especially in a school setting where there are strict boundaries between teachers and students.\n\nThe teacher's concern about being called a creep is valid. Even though his intent was to correct a wardrobe malfunction, the method of communication could be problematic. A note might come across as personal or could be misinterpreted, especially if it's written in a way that's not professional. Also, considering the school's policies, any communication with a student about their clothing should probably be done in a more formal manner, like in person during a private moment or through appropriate channels to avoid any appearance of impropriety.\n\nThe student might feel embarrassed or targeted, leading to the dirty looks and potential rumors. The teacher might have been better off addressing it discreetly in front of the whole class as a general reminder, or maybe through a more formal approach. Since the note was a direct, personal message, it could be perceived as the teacher being overly focused on the student's body, which is not professional. \n\nIn many schools, there are specific protocols for interactions with students, especially regarding personal matters. The teacher might not have followed those, leading to the student and her friends feeling uncomfortable. Even if the teacher wasn't in any trouble from superiors yet, the perception is important here. The risk of the note being seen as inappropriate is high, and the teacher's job is to maintain a professional environment.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method he used to address the issue was unprofessional and could lead to misinterpretation, regardless of his intent. Teachers should avoid such direct, personal notes about a student's appearance to prevent any potential for harassment claims or damage to their professional reputation.\n"
