I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling the student her underwear was showing.\n\nFirst, the scenario: A male teacher notices a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, showing her underwear. He tried ignoring it, but she kept doing it. He decided to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" Now, the student and her friends are giving him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nSo, the key points here. The teacher is male, the student is female. He's a high school teacher. He tried multiple ways to handle it without confrontation, like holding her after class or emailing, but decided a note was better. The student scoffed and put her feet down. Now, the student and friends think he's a creep.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, let's consider boundaries. Teachers are supposed to maintain professional boundaries with students. Any personal comments, especially about a student's clothing, can be problematic. Even if the intention was to correct her, the method might be inappropriate. \n\nPassing a note about a student's underwear could be seen as crossing a line, especially given the power dynamic. The teacher is an adult in a position of authority, and the student is a minor. Even if the teacher's intent was to help, the note might be perceived as inappropriate or even harassing. \n\nAlso, the fact that the student was wearing a skirt and putting her feet up might be a cultural or school dress code issue. The teacher could have addressed it in a more formal way, like discussing it with the student in a private, professional setting, perhaps with a colleague present. \n\nBut the teacher tried to be discreet. However, regardless of the method, commenting on a student's underwear is a sensitive issue. It's possible that the student didn't realize she was showing, but the teacher's approach might not be the best. The teacher should consider that even if the student was unaware, the teacher's responsibility is to maintain professional conduct. \n\nAnother angle: if the student's clothing was against the school's dress code, the teacher should report that through proper channels, not handle it personally. If it's not against the code, then maybe the teacher has no standing to comment. \n\nIn any case, the act of commenting on a student's underwear, especially in a note, can be seen as unprofessional and potentially inappropriate. The teacher's concern about rumors and career impact is valid because such situations can lead to misunderstandings and accusations. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while the teacher may have had good intentions, the action of pointing out the underwear in a note is likely unprofessional and crosses boundaries. Therefore, the teacher is in the wrong.\n"
