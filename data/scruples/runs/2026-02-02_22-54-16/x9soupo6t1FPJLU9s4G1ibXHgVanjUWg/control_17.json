I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear was showing. The situation is that the student was wearing a skirt and had her feet up on the desk, which caused her underwear to be visible. The teacher passed her a note with \"your underwear is showing,\" which made the student and her friends give him dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the teacher's actions were appropriate. The teacher is male, the student is female, and they are in a high school setting. The key here is whether the teacher's method of addressing the issue was appropriate. The student was repeatedly flashing her underwear, which the teacher found uncomfortable. The teacher tried different ways to address it without being confrontational: note, not calling her out in front of others, etc.\n\nThe teacher's intention was to inform the student politely. However, passing a note about a student's underwear could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the power dynamic between a teacher and a student. There's a risk that the student or others might misinterpret the note as a sexual comment or harassment. Even if the teacher's intent was innocent, the message itself is about a student's private clothing, which can be sensitive. \n\nIn a professional setting, especially with minors, it's crucial to avoid any situation that could lead to misunderstandings. The teacher could have addressed it in a more formal way, like speaking to the student after class in a public setting, or involving a colleague to be present. Emailing might not be the best either, but the note, while direct, might come across as too personal. \n\nThe student's reaction and the friends' dirty looks suggest that the note might have been perceived negatively. Even if the teacher is not in trouble according to the school, the damage to his relationship with the students and potential for rumors is real. \n\nSo, considering all that, the teacher's approach, while well-intentioned, might not have been the best method. He could have handled it differently to avoid any appearance of impropriety. The answer is likely that he is in the wrong (A), because the method chosen could lead to misunderstandings given the context of a teacher-student relationship.\n"
