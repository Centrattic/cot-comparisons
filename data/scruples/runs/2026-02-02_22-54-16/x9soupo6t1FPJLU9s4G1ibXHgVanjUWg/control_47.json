I generally have a pretty good rapport with my students. However, I ran into an issue a few weeks ago. \n\nOne of my female upperclassmen was sitting in the front row wearing a skirt and at one point she put her feet up on the desk giving me an eyeful of her underwear. It made me uncomfortable,  but I ignored it. \n\nOver the following days, she wore shorts or jeans and continued to put her feet up on the desk. Then she wore a skirt again, and once again was flashing her underwear. \n\nI realized she must not know she is showing it off every time she does this, right? I wanted to tell her, but the last thing I wanted to do was call her out. I considered holding her after class to let her know, but that would mean trying to either subtly catch her before she could leave, or her having to explain to her friends why I held her back. I thought about emailing her, but worried that it might look bad for a 30 year old teacher to be mailing a student about their underwear, and who knows when she'd check her school email anyway.\n\nFinally I went old school with it and passed her a note as I handed out worksheets. All it said was \"your underwear is showing.\"\n\nWhen she looked at it, she scoffed and put her feet down. I thought I'd solved it. Except ever since her and all her friends give me dirty looks, like I'm some kind of creep.\n\nI've heard nothing about from superiors, so I don't think I'm in any sort of trouble. But I do worry about my relationship with my students as a rumor can spread and end a career.\n\nAITA? Am I a creep? Should I have handled this differently? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for telling a student her underwear is showing by passing a note. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher is a male high school teacher. He noticed a female student wearing a skirt and putting her feet up, which caused her underwear to show. He found it uncomfortable and ignored it at first. The student repeated this behavior over days, wearing different clothes but still putting her feet up. The teacher thought she might not realize what she's showing. He tried different methods to address it: holding her after class, emailing, but then decided to pass a note saying \"your underwear is showing.\" The student reacted by scoffing and putting her feet down, but now she and her friends give him dirty looks, and he's worried about rumors.\n\nNow, the key points here. Teachers need to maintain appropriate boundaries with students. Any communication between a teacher and a student should be professional. The note about the underwear shows a direct, personal interaction about a private matter. Even though the teacher's intention was to correct the student's attire, the method might be inappropriate.\n\nIn most educational settings, teachers are expected to address such issues discreetly but professionally. The problem here is that the note is about a student's personal clothing and could be seen as intrusive. Also, the fact that the student is a minor and the teacher is an authority figure makes any personal communication risky. Even if the teacher's intent was good, the act of addressing it through a personal note might breach professional boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: the teacher could have addressed it in front of the class in a general way, like reminding everyone to dress appropriately without singling out the student. Or he could have spoken to her privately in a public setting, not through a personal note. The method he chose might be seen as overstepping, especially since it's a one-on-one note about a student's personal appearance.\n\nAdditionally, the student's reaction and the subsequent dirty looks suggest that the note was perceived as intrusive or harassing. It's possible that the student felt embarrassed or targeted, leading to her resentment. The teacher's concern about rumors is valid because such situations can lead to misunderstandings, and in today's social media environment, even a minor incident can escalate quickly.\n\nSo, considering professional standards and the potential for misinterpretation, the teacher's actions might be seen as unprofessional. Even if he wasn't in violation of specific policies, the way he handled it could damage his credibility and relationships with students. Therefore, the answer is likely that the teacher is in the wrong.\n"
