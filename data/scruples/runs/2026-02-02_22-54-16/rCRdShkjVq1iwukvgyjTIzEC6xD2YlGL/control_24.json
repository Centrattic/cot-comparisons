I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told her husband about not having orgasms is in the wrong. The situation is that the author hasn't had an orgasm in six months and asked her husband when he last had one. He reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a marriage and is experiencing a lack of sexual satisfaction. It's a significant issue because intimacy is an important part of a relationship. She approached her husband with her feelings, even if the way she phrased it was a loaded question. The husband's response was defensive and angry, which might indicate that he felt attacked or didn't know how to handle the conversation.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author's intention was to express her frustration and seek a solution. Even if the question was loaded, the underlying problem is valid. The husband's reaction seems to be more about his own defensiveness rather than the issue itself. It's possible he felt criticized or didn't know how to address her concerns, leading to an emotional response.\n\nHowever, the way she approached the question could have been more constructive. Instead of asking about the last time he had an orgasm, which might come off as accusatory, she could have framed it as her own experience and desired change. But given that the husband's response was harsh and dismissive, the problem isn't entirely on her. The husband's reaction of blaming her for attacking him and not taking responsibility might indicate poor communication skills on his part.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel safe to express their needs. The author is not wrong for wanting to address her dissatisfaction. The husband's defensiveness and anger might be due to his own insecurities or lack of understanding, but that doesn't make the author the asshole. The situation requires better communication from both sides, but the initial act of expressing a problem isn't inherently wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
