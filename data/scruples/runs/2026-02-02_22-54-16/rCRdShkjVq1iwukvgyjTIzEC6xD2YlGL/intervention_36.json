I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author hasn't had an orgasm since October and brings this up to her husband. He reacts negatively, getting angry and defensive. She's asking if she's the asshole for initiating this conversation.\n\nFrom my perspective, communication is a key part of any relationship. If one partner is experiencing dissatisfaction, especially regarding intimacy, it's important to address it. The author did express her feelings directly, even if the timing or phrasing might have been off. However, the husband's response seems overly defensive and aggressive. He didn't take the opportunity to understand her feelings but instead turned the situation into a personal attack. That kind of reaction can indicate a deeper issue in how they handle conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, bringing up a sensitive topic like this can be approached in different ways. Maybe the author could have been more specific about her needs or concerns rather than just stating the absence of orgasms. But the core issue is about their communication styles. The husband's anger and subsequent behavior (slamming doors, half-apologies) suggest he's not handling the conversation constructively, which isn't the author's fault.\n\nSo, considering the dynamics here, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings. The problem seems more about the husband's response rather than the act of communication itself. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
