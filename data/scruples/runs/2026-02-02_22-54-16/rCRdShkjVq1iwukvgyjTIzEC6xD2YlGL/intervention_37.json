I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation involves communication issues in their marriage.\n\nFirst, the author didn't approach the topic in a constructive way. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which might have been a loaded question. Her husband reacted negatively, maybe because he felt attacked. The author's frustration is valid, but the way she brought it up led to conflict.\n\nThe husband's response was defensive and angry, which isn't ideal. However, the author's method of communication could have been more effective. Instead of confronting him with a question that might make him feel criticized, she might have approached it more gently. She did apologize after realizing her approach was problematic, but the damage was already done.\n\nThe key point here is that the husband's reaction is also indicative of deeper issues in their communication. But the initial question from the author was a catalyst. She's not entirely wrong because addressing intimacy issues is important, but the manner in which she did it could be improved. However, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she did express her frustration and then apologized, it's a communication problem rather than her being entirely at fault. But the way she framed the question might have been the wrong approach. So maybe the answer is B, but there's nuance.\n"
