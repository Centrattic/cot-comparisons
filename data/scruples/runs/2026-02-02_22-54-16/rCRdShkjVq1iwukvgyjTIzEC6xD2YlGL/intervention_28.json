I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had orgasms in six months. The situation is that the husband got angry and defensive when she brought it up, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is married, and this is a communication issue in the relationship. She's expressing a problem she's been having\u2014no orgasms in six months. That's a significant issue for her, and she brought it up directly. Her husband's reaction was defensive and angry, which might indicate he didn't handle it well, but the question is about her.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and intent. She asked a question that was meant to open up a discussion about their sex life. While the way she phrased it might have been a \"loaded question,\" as her husband mentioned, that doesn't necessarily mean she was wrong. People often struggle with how to bring up sensitive topics. The fact that she apologized after realizing it upset him shows she tried to diffuse the situation.\n\nHer husband's response was aggressive and dismissive. He didn't address her concern but instead focused on feeling attacked. That's a red flag in communication. However, the question is whether she was wrong for bringing up the issue. \n\nIn relationships, partners are expected to communicate their needs and concerns. Suppressing such issues can lead to more significant problems. So, even if the approach was not perfect, the act of communicating a problem isn't inherently wrong. The husband's reaction is more about his response to the problem rather than the problem itself.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The issue lies in how the husband reacted, not necessarily in her bringing up the issue. So the answer should be B.\n"
