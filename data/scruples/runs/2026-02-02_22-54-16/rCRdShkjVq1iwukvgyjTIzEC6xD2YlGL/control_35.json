I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted about their marital issue is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife told her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months, and he reacted negatively. The key points here are communication, expectations, and the dynamics of their relationship.\n\nFirst, the wife is expressing a legitimate concern about their sexual relationship. Not having an orgasm for that long can be a valid issue, and she's bringing it up to address it. Her husband's reaction seems defensive and aggressive, which is problematic. He's dismissing her feelings and making it about himself instead of addressing her needs. \n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. She asked a direct question, which might have been confrontational. However, the husband's response was disproportionate\u2014shouting, slamming doors, and not taking her feelings seriously. The wife apologized for her approach, but the husband's reaction was still hostile. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is essential. While the wife could have approached the topic differently, the husband's response is more concerning. He's not engaging constructively and is instead lashing out. The wife is seeking validation and a resolution, which is understandable. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the main issue seems to stem from the husband's inability to handle the conversation maturely. The wife's initial action, while perhaps a sensitive topic, wasn't inherently wrong. The blame here is more on the husband's reaction than her bringing up the issue. Therefore, she's not the asshole.\n"
