I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronting him about it.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman hasn't had an orgasm since October, and she's frustrated. She asks her husband when he last had one. He reacts negatively, getting angry and defensive. She then apologizes for how she approached it, but he's still upset, slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe key points here are communication styles and emotional responses. The author's intent was to express her frustration and seek a solution, not to attack. However, the way she asked the question might have been a \"loaded question,\" as the husband pointed out. Loaded questions can make the other person feel defensive, which he did. But the husband's reaction seems extreme\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors. His response was not constructive and indicates a problem in how he handles criticism or sensitive topics.\n\nThe author apologized for her approach, which shows she's trying to communicate and resolve the issue. The husband's response, on the other hand, is more about deflecting blame and not taking responsibility. He's acting out instead of addressing the underlying issue.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action was to communicate her needs, which is healthy. The problem arises in how the husband responded. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings, even if the delivery could be improved. The husband's reaction is more indicative of the issue here. So, the answer is B.\n"
