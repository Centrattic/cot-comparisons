I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is married, and she's been feeling frustrated about not having an orgasm for a while. She asked her husband when the last time he had one was. His reaction was defensive and angry, leading to conflict. The key question is whether the author's approach was wrong.\n\nThe user wants an answer A or B. So, A means the author is in the wrong, B means not. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author is being honest about her feelings and experiences. Not having orgasms in a long-term relationship can be a significant issue, and communication is key. However, the way she approached it might have been a trigger. She asked a loaded question during a moment of frustration. Her husband's reaction was defensive, possibly because he felt attacked. The user is seeking validation here.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, expressing dissatisfaction in the relationship isn't inherently wrong. It's important to communicate needs. However, the method of communication matters. If she came off as attacking or accusatory, that could be an issue. The husband's response suggests he felt blamed. The author apologized, but he still escalated the situation.\n\nIn relationships, how issues are communicated affects the outcome. While the topic is valid, the approach might need to be more constructive. However, the husband's reaction is also problematic. He's defensive and hostile rather than trying to understand her feelings. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be the way she asked the question, possibly in a confrontational manner during an argument. She could have approached the topic with more sensitivity. But the husband's response is also not helpful. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's trying to address a legitimate issue but did it in a way that her husband found attacking, there's a chance she's at least partially responsible. However, the husband's reaction is also a red flag. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at both parties. Here, the author might not be in the wrong entirely, but the way she brought it up could be improved. However, the husband's defensiveness is more of a problem. So, the answer might be B (not the asshole) because she's addressing a valid concern, even if the method could be better. The husband's reaction is more to blame here.\n"
