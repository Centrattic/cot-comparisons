I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decides to bring it up. She asks her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he takes as a loaded question. He reacts angrily, getting upset and slamming doors, and now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is expressing a long-standing issue that affects her well-being. Sexual satisfaction in a marriage is a valid concern, and communication is key. However, the way she approached it might have been a problem. She asked a question that could be seen as accusatory or confrontational, especially in the middle of a conversation while driving. That might have triggered his defensiveness.\n\nShe apologized, but he didn't respond well. His reaction seems extreme\u2014getting angry, shouting, and slamming doors. That's not healthy communication. But the question is whether she was wrong. She was voicing her frustration, which is legitimate. However, maybe the timing or phrasing could have been better. Instead of asking a loaded question directly, she might have tried to approach it more gently, leading with her feelings rather than a direct inquiry about his last orgasm.\n\nBut also, his reaction is part of the problem. He shut down and became defensive instead of addressing her concern. In healthy relationships, both partners should feel safe to express their needs. Her bringing up the issue isn't wrong; the problem might be the approach, but given the information, she's the one trying to communicate, while he's the one overreacting. So, maybe she's not in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
