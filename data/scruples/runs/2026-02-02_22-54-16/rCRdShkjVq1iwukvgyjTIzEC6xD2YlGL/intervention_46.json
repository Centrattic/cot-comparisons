I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 24-year-old woman married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to bring it up. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he found loaded. She then shared her own experience, leading to him reacting negatively\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors, and making half-hearted apologies. She's questioning if she was wrong for bringing it up.\n\nThe key points here are communication in a relationship and the approach taken. The author felt frustrated and decided to be honest about her lack of sexual satisfaction. However, she approached it by asking her husband a loaded question first, which he found confrontational. Then she stated her own situation, which he took as an attack.\n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. Open communication is generally encouraged in relationships, especially regarding intimacy issues. However, the way she initiated the conversation might have been problematic. By starting with a loaded question and then making a statement about her own lack of orgasms, it could come off as accusatory. Her husband's reaction indicates that he felt attacked, even if her intention was to discuss the issue constructively.\n\nBut, her intention was to address a problem that affects both of them. Not communicating about sexual dissatisfaction can lead to long-term issues. However, the method of communication matters. Approaching it with a confrontational tone can lead to defensiveness, as seen in her husband's response.\n\nSo, the question is whether her approach was wrong. If she had expressed her feelings without comparing or attacking her husband, perhaps it would have been more effective. For example, using \"I\" statements to express her frustration without blaming him might have been better. However, the act of bringing up the issue itself is not wrong. The problem might be more about how she communicated it rather than the topic itself.\n\nThe husband's reaction is also important. His anger and defensiveness suggest possible communication issues or insecurity. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. While the approach could be improved, the act of seeking to address the issue isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but she might need to work on her communication style. However, based on the scenario, the main question is whether she's the asshole. Since the husband's reaction is extreme and unproductive, the author might not be entirely at fault here. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
