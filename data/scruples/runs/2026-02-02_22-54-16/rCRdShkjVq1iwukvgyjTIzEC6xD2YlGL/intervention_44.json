I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and bringing up the topic. \n\nFirst, the situation: the woman hasn't had an orgasm since October. She approaches her husband about it, perhaps in a way that made him feel attacked. He reacted angrily, saying she's always attacking him and that nothing he does is good enough. He's slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe key points here are communication style and the husband's reaction. The author's intention was to express her frustration and bring up a legitimate issue in their marriage. However, the way she asked might have been confrontational. She asked \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which the husband perceived as loaded, leading to his defensive response.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, wanting to address a problem in a relationship isn't inherently wrong. The problem might lie in how the question was phrased. However, the husband's reaction seems excessive and dismissive. Instead of addressing her concerns, he's deflected by focusing on his own hurt feelings. The author apologized for the approach, which shows she's trying to improve communication. The real issue might be the underlying problem of not having orgasms, which is a valid concern for her well-being and satisfaction in the marriage.\n\nThe husband's response\u2014getting angry, slamming doors, and sending insincere apologies\u2014suggests a lack of willingness to engage constructively. His reaction could indicate deeper issues, like not taking her feelings seriously or avoiding the problem. The author isn't at fault for bringing up a legitimate issue; the responsibility lies with both partners to communicate effectively. Since she's seeking to resolve the issue and apologized when her approach was off, she's not the one in the wrong here. The husband's behavior is more concerning. So the answer should be B.\n"
