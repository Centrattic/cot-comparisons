I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. The husband reacts negatively, getting angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a 24-year-old woman who is trying to communicate about her sexual dissatisfaction. Open communication about sexual needs is important in a relationship, and not being able to achieve an orgasm could indicate a problem that needs addressing. The husband's reaction seems defensive and hostile, which isn't a healthy way to handle such a conversation. \n\nThe user mentioned that the husband responded with a loud groan and accused her of attacking him. That kind of reaction suggests he might be feeling blamed or criticized, leading to anger. However, the author's initial question was about her own experience, not necessarily attacking him. The way she approached it might have been abrupt, but the core issue is her lack of satisfaction, which is a valid concern.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to decide if that's the case. The key factors here are communication, the right to express one's needs, and the husband's response. In most relationship advice, being honest about one's feelings is encouraged, even if it's difficult. The husband's anger and defensiveness might be his own insecurities or lack of willingness to address the issue. \n\nThe author apologized for her approach, which shows she's trying to be considerate. The husband's subsequent actions (slamming doors, blowing up her phone, half-hearted apologies) indicate he's not handling the situation well. The question is whether the author's initial honest communication was wrong. Since she's expressing her feelings and seeking a solution, it's not inherently wrong. The husband's reaction is the problem here, not her bringing it up. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's advocating for her needs, which is important, and the husband's defensiveness is the issue. The situation requires better communication and understanding from both sides, but starting the conversation isn't the fault.\n"
