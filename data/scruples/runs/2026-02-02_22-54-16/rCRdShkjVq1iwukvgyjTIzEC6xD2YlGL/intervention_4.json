I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about a married couple. The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decides to tell her husband. She asks him when he last had one, which leads to an argument. He reacts angrily, feeling attacked. She apologizes, but he's still upset and slamming doors. She's seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is sharing a problem she's been having, which is important for their relationship. Open communication about sexual health is generally encouraged. However, the way she approached it might have been a trigger for her husband. She used a question that he perceived as loaded. Maybe she could have framed it differently to avoid making him feel defensive. But on the other hand, initiating a conversation about sexual dissatisfaction is necessary for both partners.\n\nHer husband's reaction seems excessive. Getting angry and shouting suggests he might not be handling the conversation well. His response of feeling like everything he does is wrong indicates possible defensiveness or insecurity. However, his anger and subsequent actions (slamming doors, half-hearted apologies) are problematic. \n\nThe woman apologized for her approach, which shows she tried to de-escalate. The husband's response isn't healthy. The key point is whether she had the right to express her feelings. Since she's experiencing dissatisfaction, she's not in the wrong for wanting to address it. The issue is more about communication style, but the husband's reaction is more indicative of his own problems rather than her being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's raising a valid concern, and while communication could be improved, she isn't at fault for initiating the conversation.\n"
