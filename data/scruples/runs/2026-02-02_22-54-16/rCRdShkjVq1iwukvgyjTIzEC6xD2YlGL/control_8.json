I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a married couple having issues with intimacy. The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and was frustrated enough to ask her husband when he last had one. She then told him she hadn't had one since October. His reaction was defensive and angry, and now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is trying to communicate a problem in the relationship\u2014lack of sexual satisfaction. It's a sensitive topic, and bringing it up can be tough. The way she approached it might have been a bit confrontational. She asked a loaded question about when he last had an orgasm, which could come off as accusatory. But the underlying issue is real and important. \n\nHer husband's reaction seems disproportionate. He immediately got defensive, started shouting, and didn't address her actual concern. Instead of discussing why she's not having orgasms, he focused on her approach. That suggests he might not be handling the conversation well. However, the way she brought it up could have contributed to the tension. \n\nThe key here is whether she's in the wrong. If she's trying to address a legitimate issue but the way she did it was poor, maybe she's partially at fault. But if her husband is being defensive and not engaging in a constructive conversation, then she might not be in the wrong. The question is whether her asking about her own lack of orgasms is a valid concern. Since it's her experience and she's trying to communicate it, that's her right. However, the method of questioning might not be the best approach. \n\nBut the husband's reaction is also problematic. He didn't acknowledge her feelings and instead became hostile. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to discuss issues without defensiveness. The fact that he's making excuses and not addressing her actual problem might mean he's more at fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to express her dissatisfaction. The wrong here might lie more with the husband's reaction. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
