I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asked him when he last had one, and he reacted poorly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman hasn't had an orgasm for a long time and is frustrated. She brings it up, but her husband gets defensive and angry. He starts shouting and slamming doors, which is a negative reaction. \n\nThe key points here are communication styles. She asked a question that was a bit loaded, as she admits. But is she in the wrong for expressing her feelings? In a healthy relationship, partners should feel comfortable discussing their needs and concerns. However, the way she approached it might have been abrupt. Maybe she could have framed it differently to avoid putting him on the defensive.\n\nBut then, the husband's reaction is extreme. He didn't handle the conversation well. He turned it into an attack on himself instead of addressing her concern. That suggests he might be in the wrong for not being open to the discussion. However, the woman initiating the conversation is not inherently wrong. She's addressing a problem that's affecting her, which is valid.\n\nThe question is whether she's the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user wants a simple answer. Considering that she's trying to communicate an issue, even if the approach could be smoother, the husband's reaction is more problematic. So the author isn't in the wrong for bringing it up. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
