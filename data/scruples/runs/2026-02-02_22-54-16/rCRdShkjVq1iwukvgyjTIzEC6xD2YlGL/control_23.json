I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronted her husband about it. The husband reacted angrily, and now the wife is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The wife is expressing her frustration about their sexual relationship. It's a sensitive topic, and communication can be tricky here. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he found loaded. She then told him she hadn't had one since October. His reaction was defensive, with anger and accusations. She apologized, but he continued to act out by slamming doors and sending insincere apologies.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and mutual understanding. The wife is trying to address a legitimate issue\u2014lack of sexual satisfaction. While her approach might have been confrontational (asking about his last orgasm could come off as accusatory), the husband's response seems overly defensive and dismissive. His anger and the subsequent behavior (slamming doors, blowing up her phone) indicate a failure to handle the conversation constructively.\n\nIn relationships, discussing sexual needs is important. The wife's right to express her dissatisfaction isn't wrong. However, the way she brought it up might have been unhelpful. Conversely, the husband's reaction is problematic because he's not engaging in a productive dialogue. He's deflecting and being hostile instead of addressing the issue.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. While she could have approached the topic more gently, the husband's response was clearly off. The wife isn't the asshole here because she's raising a valid concern. The husband's behavior and refusal to address the issue properly are the main issues. The wife isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate her needs, even if the method could have been better. The husband's defensiveness and lack of empathy are more significant problems.\n"
