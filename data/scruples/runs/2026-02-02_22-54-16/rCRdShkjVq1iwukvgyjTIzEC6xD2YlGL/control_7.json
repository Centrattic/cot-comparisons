I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when she told her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The author brought up a personal and sensitive issue. She asked her husband about his orgasms first, which might have been a way to approach the topic without directly criticizing him. But he reacted negatively, calling her approach a loaded question and getting angry.\n\nThe husband's response was defensive and upset. He didn't address the issue but instead took it as a personal attack. He started shouting and slamming doors, which is not a healthy way to handle the conversation. His half-hearted apologies after getting angry also suggest he wasn't really addressing the problem. \n\nThe author's intention was to share her frustration and maybe seek a solution. She apologized for her approach when he felt attacked, which shows she was trying to be considerate. However, how she approached it might have been a factor. Maybe a more collaborative conversation would have been better, but the husband's reaction seems overly defensive and not conducive to solving the issue. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a two-way street. The author's honesty is valid, but the way she brought it up might have been abrupt. However, the husband's response was more harmful, making the situation worse. The problem isn't just about who started it but how both are handling it. But the question is specifically about the author. Since she was trying to communicate an issue and he reacted poorly, she's not entirely at fault. The husband's defensiveness and anger are part of the problem. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
