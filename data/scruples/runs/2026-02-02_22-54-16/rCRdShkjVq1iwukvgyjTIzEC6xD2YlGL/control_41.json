I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, the situation: The woman hasn't had an orgasm since October. She's been feeling frustrated and, during a conversation while driving, she asks her husband when he last had an orgasm. He reacts negatively, getting angry and upset. She then tells him she hasn't had one since October, which leads to him being defensive and angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and how the information was delivered. The woman was trying to express her frustration about their sex life. She approached the topic by asking him first, which might have been a way to level the playing field, but he interpreted it as a loaded question. His reaction was defensive and angry, which is not helpful. \n\nIs the woman wrong for bringing up her lack of orgasms? Probably not. It's important to communicate in a relationship, especially regarding intimacy. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked him first, which could have been a way to discuss mutual issues, but he didn't take it well. \n\nThe husband's response seems to be in the wrong because he's reacting with anger instead of addressing the issue. But the question is whether the wife is in the wrong. She did communicate her problem, even if the method was a bit confrontational. However, she also apologized, which shows she tried to de-escalate. \n\nSo, considering that she was expressing a legitimate concern in a relationship, and while the timing and method might be debatable, the core issue is about needing to address her lack of satisfaction. Since the husband's reaction was disproportionate and hostile, it's more about his response than hers. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
