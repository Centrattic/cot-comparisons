I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation involves a lack of communication in their marriage, which is causing frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author hasn't had an orgasm since October, and she's been feeling frustrated. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he found loaded. His reaction was defensive and angry, leading to conflict. \n\nThe key points here are communication styles and the nature of the conversation. The author's intent was to express her dissatisfaction, which is a valid concern. However, the way she approached it might have been triggering for her husband. The question \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" could be perceived as a criticism of his performance, especially if the husband is sensitive about it. \n\nBut the husband's reaction seems overly defensive. He turned the conversation into an attack on himself, which might indicate that he's struggling with self-esteem or insecurity in their relationship. His response of anger and yelling suggests a lack of emotional maturity or poor communication skills. \n\nThe author apologized for her approach, which shows she tried to de-escalate the situation. However, the husband's continued anger and slamming doors indicate that the problem isn't just the author's question but maybe deeper issues in their communication. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author had a legitimate reason to bring up the issue. Suppressing such feelings can harm a relationship in the long run. However, the method of communication could have been more constructive. Maybe using \"I\" statements to express her feelings without blaming him would have been better. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's defensive response and inability to handle the conversation calmly are problematic. Healthy communication in relationships involves active listening and addressing issues without turning them into personal attacks. \n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong for bringing up the issue, the way she asked might have contributed to the conflict. However, the husband's reaction is more concerning. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since she had a valid reason to express her dissatisfaction, even if the approach could be improved, she isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
