I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is a 24-year-old woman married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and asked her husband when he last had one. His reaction was defensive and angry. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. It's common for partners to have different sexual needs and satisfaction levels. The woman is expressing her frustration, which is valid. The husband's response seems defensive and dismissive, which could indicate he's not handling the conversation well.\n\nBut the way she approached the question might have been a trigger. She asked about his last orgasm, which could come off as accusatory. However, she did apologize after realizing he was upset. The key here is whether her initial question was a reasonable way to address the issue or if it was confrontational.\n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors\u2014doesn't seem healthy. He's not taking responsibility but instead flipping the problem onto her. That's a red flag. However, the woman's approach might have contributed to the conflict by framing it as a loaded question. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the main issue is their communication. The woman is trying to address a problem she's experiencing, which is important for her well-being. The husband's response is toxic. While her method might not have been perfect, the root issue is his overreaction and lack of empathy. So, she's not in the wrong for expressing her needs, even if the way she did it could be improved. The husband's behavior is more concerning here. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not the asshole.\n"
