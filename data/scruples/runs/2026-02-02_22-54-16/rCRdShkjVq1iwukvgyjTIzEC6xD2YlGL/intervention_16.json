I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the wife) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation is about communication in their marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months, which is a significant issue for her. She's frustrated and decides to bring it up by asking her husband when he last had one. That's a loaded question, as he pointed out. But her intention is to express her own problem, not to attack him directly. \n\nHer husband's reaction is defensive and angry. He responds with a loud groan and accuses himself of being awful, then turns to blaming her for attacking him. This reaction suggests he might feel criticized or defensive about his performance. However, the wife's initial statement is about her own experience, so she's not attacking him per se but sharing her frustration. \n\nThe key here is whether she approached the topic in a constructive way. She could have framed it differently, maybe using \"I\" statements to focus on her feelings without comparing or implying a problem with him. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since she's sharing her truth and the issue is her lack of satisfaction, she's not wrong for communicating that need. The husband's reaction is more about how he handled the situation, not her for bringing it up. \n\nAlso, the husband's response of slamming doors and half-hearted apologies indicates his poor communication, which is a separate issue. The wife's actions were a legitimate attempt to address a problem in the relationship. So, the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
