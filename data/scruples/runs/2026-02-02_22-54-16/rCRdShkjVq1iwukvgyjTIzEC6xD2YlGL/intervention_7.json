I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronting him about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is married, both in their early 20s. The wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months, which is causing her frustration. She asks her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he perceives as a loaded question. The husband's reaction is defensive and angry, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are communication and intent. The author's intention was to express her frustration and perhaps start a conversation about their sex life. The husband, however, took it as an attack. Even though the question might be phrased in a way that could be seen as confrontational, the underlying issue is about unmet needs in the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. In relationships, discussing sexual satisfaction is important and necessary. However, the approach matters. The author's question was direct and might have caught her husband off guard, leading to his defensive reaction. But his response seems overly hostile. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I agree. Open communication is crucial, even if the method could be improved. The husband's reaction is more concerning because he's deflecting blame instead of addressing the issue. The author had a valid reason to bring it up, so she's not the asshole here.\n"
