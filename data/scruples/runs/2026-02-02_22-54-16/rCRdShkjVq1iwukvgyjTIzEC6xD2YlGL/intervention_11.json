I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the woman (AITA) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, communicating about sexual dissatisfaction is generally considered important in a relationship. The woman is bringing up a personal and sensitive issue, which can be difficult. She approached her husband while he was driving, which might have been a poor timing choice, but the content of her message is valid. She's expressing a problem that affects both of them.\n\nHer husband's reaction seems defensive and angry. He interpreted her question as an attack, which led to conflict. However, the root issue is a lack of sexual satisfaction, which is a legitimate concern. The woman apologized, so she made an effort to de-escalate the situation. \n\nThe husband's response\u2014slamming doors, yelling, and sending half-hearted apologies\u2014indicates he's not handling the situation well. The question is whether the woman's initial act of communication was wrong. Since she's addressing a real issue and apologized, it's more about his reaction than her intent. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. Even if the timing or approach could be improved, the act of communicating a problem isn't inherently wrong. The husband's defensiveness and anger seem to stem from his own insecurities or inability to handle criticism constructively. \n\nSo, the woman isn't in the wrong for expressing her frustration. The issue lies more with how her husband reacted rather than her bringing it up. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
