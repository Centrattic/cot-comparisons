I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and the subsequent argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The woman is trying to communicate a problem in her marriage about their sexual relationship. She asks her husband when he last had an orgasm, and he reacts negatively, getting angry and upset. She apologizes but he continues to be upset, slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider if her approach was appropriate. Communication is key in relationships, but the way it's delivered matters. She mentions she was feeling frustrated and asked a loaded question in the context of a car ride. Her husband felt attacked, which led to his defensive reaction. \n\nIs she wrong for bringing up the issue? Probably not. It's important to address intimacy issues. However, the method might not have been the best. Maybe she could have approached the conversation in a calmer setting, not while he was driving. Timing and approach are important. She apologized, which shows she tried to make amends, but the husband's response was also extreme. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems disproportionate. Getting angry, shouting, and slamming doors are signs of poor communication and emotional maturity. His response of being defensive and not addressing the actual issue (their sexual dissatisfaction) is problematic. \n\nSo, the woman is not in the wrong for bringing up a legitimate issue. The husband's reaction is the real problem here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
