I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The scenario is that the author asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, and he reacted negatively. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong and is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. Communication in relationships is crucial. Bringing up unmet needs, especially regarding intimacy, is a valid concern. The author approached the topic directly, which can be seen as honest communication. However, the way she asked might have triggered her husband. He felt attacked, as he mentioned being angry and defensive. His reaction is important to consider\u2014maybe the approach could have been more considerate, but the issue itself is legitimate.\n\nThe key points are: the author's intent was to express her frustration, which is a reasonable thing to do. However, the timing and method of communication might have been problematic. If she had approached it with more empathy or a collaborative tone, perhaps the outcome would have been different. But the act of discussing her lack of orgasms isn't inherently wrong. The husband's response was emotionally charged, which might indicate his own insecurities or stress, but that doesn't make the author at fault for raising the issue.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't. She's addressing a real problem in the relationship. The husband's reaction is unhelpful, but the author's intent was valid. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
