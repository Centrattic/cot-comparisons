I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and tells her husband. The husband reacts angrily, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months, which is a significant period. She approached her husband about it, but the way she did it might have been a loaded question. He responded with anger and defensiveness. \n\nIs she wrong for bringing up the issue? Communication in relationships is important. If there's a problem, discussing it is usually better than keeping it bottled up. However, the way she approached it might have been a trigger for her husband. He felt attacked, which is a common reaction when someone feels criticized. \n\nBut wait, the problem is real. Lack of intimacy can lead to more issues if not addressed. She was honest about her frustration and shared her experience. His response was to get angry and not take responsibility for his part. The fact that he's slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies shows he's not handling it well. \n\nThe key here is whether she's in the wrong for expressing her feelings. In relationships, it's important to communicate needs, even if it's difficult. The husband's reaction is problematic, but the act of the wife talking about her lack of satisfaction isn't the issue. The problem is how they handle the communication. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to address a real issue. The husband's defensiveness and anger are the problems here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
