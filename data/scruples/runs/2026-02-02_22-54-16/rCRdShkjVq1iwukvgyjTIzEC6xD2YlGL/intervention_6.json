I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman is married, 24, and her husband is 25. She hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is six months. She brings it up to her husband, and he reacts negatively, getting angry and upset. She's asking if she's the asshole for bringing it up.\n\nThe user thinks she's not in the wrong. Let me break this down. Open communication about sexual satisfaction is generally encouraged in relationships. It's important for a healthy sex life and mutual understanding. She approached him directly, though maybe the timing or method could have been an issue. But the husband's reaction seems defensive and hostile. He didn't engage constructively; instead, he took it personally. \n\nThe wife's frustration is valid. Not achieving orgasm can be a sign of deeper issues in the relationship, like mismatched needs or techniques. By bringing it up, she's addressing a problem that could affect their intimacy. The husband's response of anger and defensiveness, rather than empathy or problem-solving, suggests he might not be handling the situation maturely. \n\nHowever, the way she asked the question could be a factor. She asked, \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which could be seen as accusatory. Maybe a more collaborative approach, like expressing her feelings without blaming him, could have led to a better conversation. But even if her approach could be improved, the core issue of her lack of satisfaction still needs addressing.\n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014groaning, shouting, slamming doors\u2014indicates he's not handling the conversation well. He's deflecting responsibility instead of addressing her needs. His half-assed apologies further show a lack of willingness to resolve the issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the woman's intent was to communicate a problem, which is a reasonable step. The husband's reaction is inappropriate, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since initiating a difficult conversation about intimacy is a valid step, and his response is the issue, she's not in the wrong. The key factor is his reaction, not her bringing it up. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
