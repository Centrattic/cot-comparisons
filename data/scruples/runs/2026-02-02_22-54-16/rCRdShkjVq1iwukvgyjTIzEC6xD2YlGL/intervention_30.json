I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The husband reacted negatively, getting angry and slamming doors, but the question is about whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships can be tricky. The author brought up a personal issue that's important for her well-being. Not having orgasms can affect intimacy and satisfaction. She asked her husband about his last orgasm, which he perceived as a loaded question. He responded defensively and angrily, which is a problem, but the user is asking if the author is wrong for bringing it up.\n\nI think the key here is the approach. The author directly addressed her frustration, which is valid. However, asking her husband about his last orgasm might have been a confrontational way to bring up her own issues. Maybe she could have approached it differently, focusing on her own feelings rather than questioning his. But the husband's reaction was extreme and invalidating. He didn't listen and turned it into an attack on himself instead of addressing the underlying issue.\n\nSo, while the author could have communicated her needs in a different way, the main problem seems to be the husband's defensiveness. The author isn't wrong for expressing her dissatisfaction, especially regarding her own sexual health. The husband's response was inappropriate, but the question is about the author's fault. I think she's not in the wrong because she's addressing a legitimate concern, even if the method could have been better. The answer should be B.\n"
