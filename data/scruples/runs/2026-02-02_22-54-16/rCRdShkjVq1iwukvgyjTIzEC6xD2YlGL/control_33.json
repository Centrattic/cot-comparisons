I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who asked about not having orgasms is in the wrong. So the situation is that the wife told her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. He reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Being honest about feelings is usually seen as important, but how it's delivered matters. The wife asked a direct question, which the husband found loaded. He responded with defensiveness and anger, which might indicate that he's struggling with the topic.\n\nThe key points here are whether the wife's approach was appropriate. She did express her frustration and shared her experience, which is valid. However, the husband's reaction suggests that maybe the way she framed the question was hurtful. But the issue is a sensitive one, and both parties might have valid feelings. \n\nThe husband's response of blaming himself and getting angry could point to his own insecurities or not knowing how to address the issue. The wife apologized, but the husband continued being upset. However, the act of communicating a problem isn't inherently wrong. \n\nIn many relationship advice contexts, open communication is encouraged even if it's difficult. So the wife isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing her needs. The husband's reaction might be a bigger issue here, but the question is whether the author (wife) is the asshole. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B (No), because she's sharing her truth, even if the delivery could be improved. But maybe not? If the way she asked was confrontational, maybe A. But the question was about the content, not the delivery. The husband's response seems more about his defensiveness. So I lean towards B.\n"
