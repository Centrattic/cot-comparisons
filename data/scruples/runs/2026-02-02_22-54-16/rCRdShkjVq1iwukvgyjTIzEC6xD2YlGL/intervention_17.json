I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple having issues with orgasms. The author, a 24-year-old woman, hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronted her husband by asking when he last had one. He responded defensively, got angry, and now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The woman is clearly struggling with a lack of sexual satisfaction, which is a valid and important issue in a marriage. She initiated a conversation to address this, which shows she's trying to communicate her needs. That's usually a healthy step in relationships.\n\nNext, the husband's reaction. He called the question loaded, which might mean he felt attacked. His immediate response with a groan and self-deprecating remarks like \"I'm SO awful\" could indicate defensiveness or low self-esteem. Then he starts shouting and blames her for always attacking him. This reaction might be unproductive and could be part of a pattern where he doesn't handle criticism well. \n\nThe author apologized for the approach, which suggests she recognized that her method might have been harsh. But the husband's follow-up actions\u2014slamming doors and sending insincere apologies\u2014seem like he's not engaging constructively. The way he apologized, \"I\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me,\" shifts the blame back to her instead of acknowledging his own behavior. That's a red flag.\n\nIn terms of the question, asking about each other's last orgasm might be a sensitive topic. The way it's approached matters. If the woman's question was meant to be confrontational, perhaps that's where the issue lies. But given her frustration and the lack of satisfaction, it's understandable she'd bring it up directly. The problem might not be the question itself but the couple's communication dynamics.\n\nThe key points are: the woman is trying to address a problem, the husband reacted with anger and defensiveness, and the author apologized, showing willingness to communicate. The husband's behavior, especially the door slamming and passive-aggressive apologies, seems more problematic. The AITA usually considers both parties' actions and intentions. Here, the woman's intent was to discuss a legitimate concern, while the husband's response was dismissive and hostile. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on how the question was phrased. If she asked it in a way that was accusatory or disrespectful, maybe A. But the post says she apologized for the approach, indicating she might have realized that. Her main issue is the lack of satisfaction, which is valid. The husband's reaction is more concerning. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
