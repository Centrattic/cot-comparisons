I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asked him when he last had one, and he reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman hasn't been able to achieve orgasm for a long time, which seems to be a recurring issue. She approached the topic by asking her husband a question, which he took as an attack. His reaction was anger and defensiveness, which might indicate he's feeling blamed. But the user is asking if she's in the wrong for bringing up the issue.\n\nThe key points here are communication and intent. The woman's intention was to express her frustration and share her experience, which is a legitimate concern in a relationship. However, the way she asked the question might have come across as confrontational. She framed it as a loaded question, so she probably expected some tension. But her husband's reaction was extreme\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors, etc. His behavior seems more problematic because he's attacking her instead of addressing the issue constructively.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, discussing sexual satisfaction is important. It's reasonable for her to share her feelings, especially if it's been an ongoing issue. However, the method of communication could be a point of consideration. Maybe a more direct and less accusatory approach would be better. But in this case, she's trying to initiate a conversation about a problem that affects both of them. It's not her fault for bringing it up; the responsibility lies more on her husband's reaction.\n\nThe husband's defensiveness and invalidating responses (\"nothing he does is ever good enough\") are signs of poor communication. He's not engaging with her feelings but instead focusing on his own defensiveness. The author apologized, which shows she's trying to de-escalate, but his response was still aggressive. This suggests that the issue might be more about his inability to handle criticism rather than the question itself.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her concerns. It's a valid issue to discuss, and she's seeking a solution. The problem lies in how her husband is responding, not necessarily in her bringing up the topic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
