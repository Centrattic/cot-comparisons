I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and then asking him when he last had one.\n\nFirst, the context: They are a married couple, both young. The wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She felt frustrated and asked her husband about his last orgasm. He got defensive and angry, responding with a groan and accusations that he's awful. The husband then starts yelling and slamming doors, apologizing insincerely. The wife is seeking validation if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the core issue is communication in their sex life. The wife is expressing her frustration, which is a valid concern. Not having orgasms can lead to dissatisfaction in a relationship, so bringing it up is reasonable. However, the way she approached it might have been off. She asked a loaded question, which the husband pointed out. Then she answered his question with her own issue, which might have triggered his defensiveness.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she's being honest about her feelings, which is important in a relationship. However, starting with a loaded question might not be the best approach. Maybe she should have framed it differently to encourage a constructive conversation. However, her intent was to express her frustration, not to attack him. The husband's reaction is aggressive and dismissive, which is problematic. He's taking her feedback as a personal attack instead of a shared problem to solve together.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the wife could have approached the conversation more carefully, the husband's response was clearly inappropriate. Slamming doors, yelling, and making half-hearted apologies are not healthy reactions. The key here is that the husband's behavior is more indicative of someone in the wrong. The wife's action was a communication attempt, albeit perhaps not the best one, but it doesn't make her the asshole. The husband's defensiveness and anger are signs of poor communication and unwillingness to address the issue constructively.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's reaction is the main issue here. She had a right to express her feelings, even if the method could be improved. The problem isn't with her bringing it up but with how her husband responded.\n"
