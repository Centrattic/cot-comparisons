I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the scenario is a married couple. The woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She's been feeling frustrated and finally asks her husband when the last time he had an orgasm was. He reacts negatively, gets angry, and there's some conflict. She's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is sharing a personal and sensitive issue. Orgasmic difficulties can be a big deal in a relationship, affecting intimacy and emotional connection. She's been keeping this to herself for six months, which is a long time. It's possible she's been trying to handle it alone or avoid confrontation, but eventually, she's reached a breaking point.\n\nHer question to her husband is direct but not necessarily hostile. She's asking about his last orgasm, which is a way to bring up the issue of their sexual satisfaction. However, her husband interprets this as an attack. He responds defensively, which leads to escalation. His reaction includes anger, shouting, slamming doors, and half-hearted apologies. That's not healthy communication.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? She's trying to communicate a problem that's been ongoing. The way she asked the question might have been awkward or caught him off guard, but the core issue is valid. She's not the one being aggressive here; she's the one who initiated the conversation to address a problem. Her apology after he got angry shows she's trying to de-escalate, but he's not responding constructively.\n\nThe husband's behavior is more concerning. His defensiveness and anger without addressing the underlying issue are signs of poor communication. He's not taking responsibility for his part in the sexual dissatisfaction. His reaction of slamming doors and sending messages that don't properly apologize suggests he's not handling the situation well.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The woman is trying to bring up an issue that's affecting her, which is a reasonable thing to do. The husband's response is what's problematic. He's not engaging in a healthy dialogue but instead reacting with anger. So, the woman isn't in the wrong for trying to address the problem. She's the one seeking a solution, whereas the husband is avoiding it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
