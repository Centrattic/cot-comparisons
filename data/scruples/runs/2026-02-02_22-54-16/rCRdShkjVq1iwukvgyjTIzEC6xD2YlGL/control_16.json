I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. He reacts negatively, getting angry and upset. The key points here are communication styles, expectations in a relationship, and how each partner is responding.\n\nFirst, the author is sharing a personal issue\u2014lack of sexual satisfaction\u2014which is a valid concern in a marriage. It's important for partners to communicate openly about their needs. However, the way she approached the question might have been a problem. She asked, \"When\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\" which he perceived as a loaded question. Maybe he felt it was a setup for criticism. Then she replied with her own timeline, which might have made him feel defensive. His reaction was strong, including anger and half-hearted apologies, which seems unhealthy. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is wrong. The wife's frustration is real, and bringing up the issue is part of addressing problems in the relationship. However, the method might need improvement. If she had approached the conversation in a non-confrontational way, perhaps her husband would have been more receptive. For example, using \"I\" statements to express her feelings without implying blame. But in this case, she did ask a question that could be seen as confrontational, especially if the husband felt attacked. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's response of becoming angry and defensive instead of empathetic is not ideal. It's possible that he's struggling with his own feelings of inadequacy or not knowing how to address the issue. His reaction of slamming the door and sending dismissive apologies suggests he's not handling the situation well. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She had legitimate concerns and tried to communicate them, even if the approach was abrupt. The husband's overreaction and refusal to engage constructively might indicate his own issues. But maybe she should have chosen a better time and a more compassionate way to bring it up. However, since the question is a direct one about their intimacy and she's seeking to address a real problem, it's not clear that she was wrong. The husband's response seems more problematic. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), because she's not the asshole for expressing a genuine concern, even if the method could be improved. The husband's reaction is more unhelpful and defensive.\n"
