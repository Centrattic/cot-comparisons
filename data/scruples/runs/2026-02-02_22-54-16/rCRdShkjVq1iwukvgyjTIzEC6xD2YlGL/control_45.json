I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 24-year-old woman married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and brings it up by asking her husband when he last had one. He reacts negatively, getting angry and upset, and then there's a lot of tension afterward. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The issue is about sexual dissatisfaction in a marriage. The author is trying to communicate her frustration, which is a valid concern. Not having orgasms can affect a person's sexual health and relationship satisfaction. However, the way she brought it up might have been confrontational. She asked a question that could be seen as loaded, especially if it's not a common topic they discuss openly.\n\nHer husband's reaction is immediate defensiveness and anger. He felt attacked, which might indicate that the communication approach was problematic. The author acknowledges that the question was loaded, so she might have been trying to initiate a conversation but didn't frame it in a constructive way. However, the core issue\u2014lack of sexual satisfaction\u2014is a legitimate problem that needs addressing.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. If she had a valid concern and tried to bring it up, even if the method wasn't perfect, does that make her the asshole? Or is the husband failing to listen and being defensive? \n\nIn relationships, communication styles matter. If she approached it with the intention to solve the problem, but used a confrontational question, maybe she could have phrased it differently. However, the husband's reaction of anger and defensiveness might indicate that he's not handling the conversation well. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. She expressed her feelings and the situation honestly. Even if the approach could be improved, bringing up a legitimate issue isn't inherently wrong. So maybe she's not the asshole, but perhaps she could have communicated better. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's bringing up a personal issue that's important for the relationship, and he's reacting with anger, he might be the one not handling it well. The author's intention was to express her dissatisfaction, which is a reasonable thing to do. The problem might lie in the method, but that doesn't necessarily make her wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's addressing a legitimate issue in her marriage, and while communication style could be improved, the act of bringing it up isn't wrong. The husband's reaction seems more like a failure to handle the conversation constructively.\n"
