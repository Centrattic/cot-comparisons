I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation. The author is a 24-year-old woman married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decides to bring it up by asking her husband when the last time he had one was. His reaction is defensive and angry, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is expressing her own experience with sexual dissatisfaction. Not having orgasms for an extended period can be a legitimate concern and might indicate issues in the relationship. Communicating such issues is important for both partners' well-being. However, how she approached it might matter. She asked him a loaded question, which he pointed out, so maybe the way she framed it was confrontational. \n\nHusband's reaction seems to be defensiveness and anger. He responds with a loud groan, accuses himself of being awful, and then becomes angry, shouting and slamming doors. His half-hearted apology suggests he's not fully addressing the issue. His response indicates he's not taking her feelings seriously and is instead becoming defensive, which isn't helpful.\n\nThe key here is whether the author was wrong in bringing up her lack of orgasms. Communicating about sexual needs is a valid and necessary part of a relationship. The husband's reaction is problematic because he's not engaging in a constructive dialogue. The author's intent was to address her own dissatisfaction, which is reasonable. However, the method of asking \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" might come across as accusatory. An alternative approach could have been more open-ended and less confrontational. \n\nBut the main issue is that the husband's response is dismissive and angry, which isn't healthy. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her needs, even if the approach could be improved. The husband's reaction is more indicative of the problem here. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's addressing a real issue, even if the method could be better. The husband's defensiveness and lack of constructive response are the bigger issues.\n"
