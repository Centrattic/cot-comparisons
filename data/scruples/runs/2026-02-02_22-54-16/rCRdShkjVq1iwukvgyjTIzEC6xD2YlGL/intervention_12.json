I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and his subsequent reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is a significant period. She approached her husband about it, asking when he last had an orgasm, and he reacted negatively. His response included deflection, anger, and blaming her approach. The author apologized for how she asked but he continued to be upset, slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication styles and emotional responses. The author was honest about her experience, which is important for a healthy relationship. However, the way she asked might have been confrontational, leading to his defensive reaction. But even if the approach was rough, the core issue is that she's expressing a legitimate concern about their sexual satisfaction. The husband's response seems to be more about taking it personally rather than addressing the underlying problem. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is crucial. The author isn't wrong for voicing her frustration, especially if this issue has been ongoing. The husband's reaction\u2014getting angry, deflecting blame, and not genuinely engaging with her concern\u2014indicates that he's not handling the communication well. However, the author's method of bringing it up might have been a loaded question, which could have triggered his defensiveness. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. The act of expressing her lack of orgasms is not inherently wrong. The problem might lie in how it was communicated. However, since the user's initial thought is that the author is not in the wrong, and given that the husband's response was inappropriate and dismissive, it's more about his reaction than her right to express her feelings. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for raising the issue, even if the approach could have been smoother. The responsibility also lies with the husband to handle the conversation constructively.\n"
