I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation involves communication issues in their marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a 24-year-old woman married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and felt frustrated enough to bring it up. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he found loaded. His reaction was defensive and angry, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points are communication styles and intent. The author's intent was to express her frustration and perhaps initiate a discussion about their sexual satisfaction. However, the way she approached it might have been abrupt. She asked a direct question that could be perceived as accusatory, especially without context or a softer approach. \n\nHer husband's reaction is important too. He became defensive and angry, which might indicate he felt attacked. His response about always being attacked and nothing being good enough suggests possible underlying issues in how they communicate. However, the initial question might have triggered that reaction.\n\nThe author apologized, but the husband's continued anger and slamming doors show that the issue isn't resolved. The user is seeking validation, but the question is whether she was wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, communication is a two-way street. While it's valid for the author to express her needs, the method could be improved. However, the husband's defensive and angry response is also problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for bringing up an important issue, but her approach could have been more constructive. The husband's reaction is also at fault, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nGiven that, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for expressing her feelings, even if the method could be better. However, sometimes in such contexts, people might consider the approach as contributing to the problem. But since she's seeking validation, it's more about whether her action was justified. The main issue here is the husband's reaction, not the author's initial statement.\n"
