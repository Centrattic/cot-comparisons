I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronted her husband. Her husband reacted angrily, got defensive, and slammed doors, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is communicating her needs, which is important in a relationship. Open communication about sexual satisfaction is crucial for both partners. She asked about the last time she had an orgasm, which is a personal topic, but not inherently wrong. Her husband's response was emotional and defensive, which might indicate he felt attacked or didn't know how to handle the conversation.\n\nThe key points here are about communication styles. The wife's approach might have been direct, but if her husband perceived it as criticism, that's a communication issue. However, bringing up a legitimate concern about marital intimacy isn't the problem. The husband's reaction\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors\u2014is more indicative of a problem. His defensiveness and inability to handle the conversation constructively might be the real issue here.\n\nBut the question is if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. She asked a question that led to conflict. However, initiating a conversation about sexual dissatisfaction isn't inherently wrong. The husband's response is problematic, but the act of expressing her needs is not. It's possible that their communication styles are clashing. The wife might need to approach the topic differently in the future, but in this instance, she was trying to address an issue that affects both of them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (Not the Asshole) because the wife is expressing her needs, even if the communication could be smoother. The husband's reaction is more concerning as it's aggressive and dismissive.\n"
