I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong when she told her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is married, and she's been unfulfilled sexually. She approached her husband directly about it, which led to an argument. Her husband reacted negatively, getting angry and defensive. She's asking if she's the asshole for bringing it up.\n\nThe key points here are communication in a relationship and the appropriateness of expressing dissatisfaction. Open communication is usually encouraged in healthy relationships. However, the way the question was asked might have influenced the reaction. She asked when the last time he had an orgasm was, which he found loaded. Then she shared her own experience, which led to conflict.\n\nHer husband's reaction seems to indicate that he felt attacked or criticized. He responded with anger and defensiveness, which isn't ideal. However, the author's intention was to express her own feelings and frustrations. She did apologize when she realized her approach might be upsetting.\n\nThe question is whether she was wrong. If the goal is to improve communication and address a problem, bringing up a concern isn't inherently wrong. However, the timing and method might need adjustment. But in this case, since she's the one experiencing dissatisfaction, she's not the one at fault. The husband's reaction is more indicative of a problem in handling the conversation. The author tried to communicate her needs, even if the approach could be improved. So, she's not the asshole here.\n"
