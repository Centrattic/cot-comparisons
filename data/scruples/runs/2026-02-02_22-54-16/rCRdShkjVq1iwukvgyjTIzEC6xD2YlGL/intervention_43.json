I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation involves communication issues in a marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author brought up a sensitive topic, which is her lack of orgasms. That's a personal and potentially vulnerable subject. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he found loaded. His reaction was defensive and angry, leading to arguments and slammed doors. \n\nThe key points here are communication styles and emotional responses. The author's intent was to express frustration and seek help, but the way she approached it might have been triggering. However, the husband's response was dismissive and hostile. He didn't engage constructively but instead became defensive and angry. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is important, but the method matters. The author might have approached it differently, perhaps with more framing around her feelings rather than a direct question. But the husband's reaction was not helpful. The author apologized, but his continued negative behavior (slamming doors, half-hearted apologies) suggests he wasn't handling the situation well either.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she was honest about her feelings and apologized when she realized the approach might be problematic, her intent was to address an issue. The husband's overreaction and lack of constructive response are also part of the problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She was trying to communicate a serious issue, even if the method could be improved. The husband's reaction is more indicative of the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
