I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asked her husband when he last had one, he got defensive and angry, and now she's feeling like maybe she did something wrong.\n\nFirst, the wife is sharing a personal and sensitive issue with her husband. The question about when he last had an orgasm could be seen as a way to open up a conversation about their sexual satisfaction. But maybe the way she approached it was abrupt. She used a question that's inherently personal, which might have caught him off guard. His reaction was defensive, so perhaps he felt attacked or didn't expect the question. \n\nHusbands and wives should communicate openly about intimacy issues. However, the method of communication can affect how the message is received. She apologized after he expressed that the approach was wrong, which shows she's trying to be understanding. The husband's response, though, seems harsh\u2014slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies. That might indicate he's not handling the situation well. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of telling her husband about her lack of orgasms is necessary for addressing the problem. However, the way she framed the question (\"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\") might have been confrontational. Maybe a better approach would be to express her own feelings and needs first, rather than asking about his. Husbands might feel blamed if the question is phrased as a comparison.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that she tried to bring up the issue, which is a valid concern. The husband's reaction\u2014getting angry and defensive\u2014could be a sign of his own issues or discomfort with the topic. The wife's apology after he explained the approach was wrong shows she's willing to adjust. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wife isn't in the wrong for trying to communicate her problem. However, the method could be improved. The husband's response is inappropriate, but the question of whether she's in the wrong depends on the approach. Since she apologized and is seeking validation, the main issue is the husband's reaction. So, the answer is B (No), as she's not in the wrong, but could work on how she communicates.\n"
