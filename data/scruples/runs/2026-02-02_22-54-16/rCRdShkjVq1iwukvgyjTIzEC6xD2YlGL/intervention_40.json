I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and asked her husband when he last had one. His reaction was defensive and angry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The wife is trying to communicate a problem she's having with their sex life. Open communication is key in any relationship, especially regarding intimacy. She approached him with a question about her own experience, which is a legitimate and important issue. \n\nHer husband's immediate reaction was to see it as a \"loaded question,\" which might indicate he's already feeling defensive or there's some underlying tension. He responded with a groan and a statement implying he's at fault, then became angry and accused her of attacking him. His behavior escalated, and even after she apologized, he didn't handle it well, slamming doors and sending insincere apologies.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The act of expressing her lack of orgasms is not inherently wrong. It's a valid concern to bring up in a relationship. However, the way she approached it might have been a factor. She asked about his last orgasm first, which could be seen as indirect. Maybe a more direct approach about her own needs would have been better, but the issue is still about her own satisfaction. \n\nThe husband's response, though, is more problematic. Defensiveness and anger without trying to understand her perspective isn't healthy. He should be open to discussing how to improve their intimacy. The fact that he's blowing up her phone and making half-hearted apologies suggests he's not addressing the real issue. \n\nThe wife apologized for how she approached the question, which shows she's trying to mend things. The husband's reaction seems extreme and dismissive. In this case, the main issue is the lack of communication and understanding. The wife is trying to address a problem that affects both of them, so she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more indicative of the issue here. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because she's voicing a legitimate concern and attempting to communicate, even if the approach could be improved. The husband's overreaction is the primary issue.\n"
