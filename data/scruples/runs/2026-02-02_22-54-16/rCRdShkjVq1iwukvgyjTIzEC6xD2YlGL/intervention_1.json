I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation involves communication in a marriage, which can be really tricky.\n\nFirst, the author is a 24-year-old married to a 25-year-old. She hasn't had an orgasm since October, and she brought it up by asking her husband when the last time he had one was. He reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. The key points here are about how the conversation was approached and the husband's response.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of communication in relationships. Bringing up a sensitive topic like sexual dissatisfaction is important for both partners, but the way it's communicated matters. The author's question was a bit indirect\u2014she asked her husband when he last had an orgasm. That might be seen as a way to broach her own issue without directly stating it, but it could come off as accusatory or a comparison. However, her intent was likely to express her own frustration. \n\nThe husband's reaction was defensive and angry, which is problematic. He didn't engage constructively but instead flipped the blame onto himself and then the author. His response of being upset and lashing out suggests he might not be handling the conversation well. The author apologized, so she tried to de-escalate, but he continued to be hostile. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, initiating a conversation about sexual dissatisfaction is not inherently wrong. The way she asked might have been a bit loaded, but the husband's reaction is more about how he handled it. The author was trying to communicate her needs, which is important for a healthy relationship. The husband's defensiveness and anger are more concerning. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's addressing a valid issue in the relationship. The husband's behavior is the problem here. The answer should be B.\n"
