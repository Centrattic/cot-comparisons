I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and brought it up to her husband. The husband reacted angrily, and now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife is communicating her feelings of frustration about not experiencing pleasure in their sex life. She asked her husband directly about when he last had an orgasm, which he took as a loaded question. He then responded with anger and defensiveness, even while driving. The wife apologized for how she approached it, but he continued to be upset, slamming doors and sending insincere apologies.\n\nThe main issue here is communication. She's trying to express a problem in their relationship, which is a valid and important topic. However, the way she approached it might have been confrontational. She asked a question that could be seen as accusatory, especially in the middle of a conversation. The husband's reaction was inappropriate and toxic, but the question is whether the wife was wrong to bring up the issue at all.\n\nIn relationships, open communication is crucial. However, the method of communication matters. The wife could have approached the topic with more sensitivity, perhaps by expressing her feelings without directly comparing her experience to his. For example, using \"I\" statements to express her own frustration rather than asking a question that might come off as a criticism of his performance. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's response was clearly problematic. Reacting with anger, defensiveness, and passive-aggressive behavior is not healthy. His reaction suggests that he's not open to addressing the issue, which could indicate deeper problems in their communication. \n\nThe wife is not in the wrong for wanting to address the lack of intimacy and trying to have an honest conversation. However, the way she phrased her question might not have been the most constructive approach. The husband, however, is definitely in the wrong for his hostile response. \n\nSo, the user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. Considering that she's trying to communicate a valid concern, even if the method could be improved, the answer is likely B (No). The husband is the one who reacted poorly, not her. Unless there's a cultural or situational context I'm missing, the wife's intention was to address a real issue, which is not wrong. The problem lies in how both parties communicated, but the wife's intent is justified.\n"
