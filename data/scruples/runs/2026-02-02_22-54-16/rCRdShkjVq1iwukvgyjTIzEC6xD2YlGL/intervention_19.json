I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and she told her husband. He reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, the wife brought up her lack of orgasms. She asked him when he last had one, which he found loaded. He got defensive and angry, even while driving. She apologized, but he kept being upset. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nWell, communication issues in relationships are common. The wife is being honest about her feelings and needs. That's important for a healthy relationship. However, the way she approached it might have been a problem. She asked a loaded question, and maybe the timing or context wasn't right, especially if they were in the car. But her reason for bringing it up is valid\u2014she's not getting satisfaction. \n\nHer husband's reaction is problematic. He got angry, shouted, and was defensive. That's not a healthy way to handle the situation. He should have been more open to discussing her feelings instead of getting upset. The wife apologized, which shows she tried to de-escalate. But even after that, he continued to act out. \n\nThe key points here are about communication and emotional response. The wife is expressing a legitimate issue, which is important for her well-being. The husband's reaction is more indicative of a problem in how he handles conflict. The wife isn't at fault for wanting to address the problem, even if the method could be improved. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). She's trying to communicate an important issue, and the husband's reaction is the main issue here.\n"
