I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The key points here are communication, the husband's reaction, and the context of their relationship dynamic.\n\nFirst, the author decided to bring up her lack of orgasms, which is a sensitive topic. She asked her husband about his last orgasm as a way to open the conversation. Her husband reacted negatively, feeling attacked and defensive. He shut down emotionally and responded with anger, which isn't helpful. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, initiating a conversation about sexual satisfaction is not inherently wrong. It's important for both partners to communicate their needs. However, the way she approached it\u2014by asking about his last orgasm before sharing hers\u2014might have been a bit loaded. But the husband's reaction seems more about defensiveness and possible insecurity rather than the question itself.\n\nThe husband's response was inappropriate. Getting angry and shutting down instead of discussing the issue constructively is a problem. The author apologized for the approach, which shows she's trying to be considerate. However, his continued anger and slamming doors indicate his issue isn't just with her question but maybe deeper communication problems.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial for both partners to feel safe discussing such matters. The fact that the author is seeking help here suggests she's trying to improve the situation. The husband's response is more indicative of his inability to handle the discussion rather than her being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking a step to address a problem that's affecting her. The issue lies more with the husband's reaction and lack of willingness to engage constructively. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
