I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for telling their husband they haven't had an orgasm in six months. The husband reacted angrily, getting defensive and upset. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Communication in relationships is crucial. The author brought up a sensitive topic, which is sexual satisfaction. It's a valid concern, and it's important for both partners to feel fulfilled. The author's question about their own lack of orgasms is a personal issue that could affect their relationship. \n\nNow, the way the question was asked is important. The author asked, \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which the husband thought was a loaded question. Maybe the husband felt defensive because he might have been assuming the author was implying it's his fault. The author then revealed her own lack of orgasms. \n\nThe husband's reaction was anger and defensiveness, which might indicate that he felt attacked or blamed. However, the author's intention was to communicate a problem, not necessarily to attack. It's possible that the husband's response was disproportionate. \n\nIn relationships, discussing sexual issues can be challenging. Both partners need to approach such topics with empathy and understanding. The author's honesty is important, but the method of communication might have triggered the husband's defensiveness. However, the husband's reaction of slamming doors, shouting, and sending half-hearted apologies suggests a lack of willingness to address the issue constructively. \n\nThe key point here is that the author was trying to express a personal issue, which is a legitimate reason to bring it up. The husband's response is more about his reaction to being criticized rather than addressing the actual problem. The author is not in the wrong for expressing her feelings, even if the approach was a bit direct. The husband's overreaction and refusal to engage in a healthy discussion would make him the one at fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to express their needs and concerns in the relationship, even if the conversation didn't go as smoothly as intended. The husband's response is more indicative of the problem here.\n"
