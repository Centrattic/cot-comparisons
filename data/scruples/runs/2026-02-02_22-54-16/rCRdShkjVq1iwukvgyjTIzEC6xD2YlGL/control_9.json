I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and finally brings it up to her husband. She asks when he last had one, and he reacts negatively, getting angry and upset. She apologizes, but he's still acting out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman isn't asking for no reason; she's had a problem for months and is frustrated. Communication is key in relationships, especially regarding intimacy. Bringing up a concern shouldn't be a problem, but maybe the way she asked could be an issue. She says she asked, \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which he took as a loaded question. Maybe he felt attacked or criticized. But she's also not the one with the issue here\u2014she's the one who hasn't had an orgasm. So why is he reacting so negatively? Perhaps he feels defensive or maybe there's another issue. But is the author wrong for expressing her frustration? \n\nHis reaction seems extreme. Slamming doors, blowing up her phone, half-hearted apologies. That's not healthy. The husband's response is more concerning. The woman is trying to communicate a problem that's affecting their relationship. If she's not having orgasms, it's valid to discuss. The way she approached it might not have been perfect, but the main issue is the lack of communication and the husband's defensiveness. \n\nHowever, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: she's had the issue for six months, approached him, he reacted angrily. She apologized, but he's still acting out. The problem might be more about the husband's reaction rather than the author's initial question. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong; it's more about the husband not handling the situation well. \n\nBut maybe the way she asked the question was confrontational. She says he thought it was a loaded question. Maybe she should have approached it more gently. However, considering the context of her frustration after six months, it's understandable she might be direct. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user is asking if the author is the asshole. The husband's behavior is more destructive, but the question is about the author's actions. Since she's trying to address a valid concern and he's overreacting, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
