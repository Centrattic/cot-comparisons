I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to tell her husband. She asked him when he last had an orgasm, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is expressing frustration because she's not getting sexual satisfaction. That's a valid concern in a relationship. The key points here are communication and how the conversation was handled. The wife brought up her lack of orgasms, which is a sensitive topic. Her husband reacted negatively, getting defensive and angry. \n\nThe question is whether she was wrong to tell him. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). I need to decide if her approach was appropriate. The husband's reaction was to get angry and defensive, maybe feeling attacked. But does that mean the wife was wrong to express her feelings?\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If there's a problem, addressing it is important. However, the way she approached it might have been a factor. She asked about his last orgasm, which could be seen as leading with a loaded question, as he pointed out. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been better, like discussing the issue without comparing their experiences. \n\nBut the main issue is her lack of satisfaction. She's not wrong for wanting to address that. The husband's reaction is problematic, as he's deflecting and getting angry instead of addressing her needs. The author apologized for her approach, but he continued to act out. That suggests that the problem isn't entirely on her. \n\nIn many cases, bringing up sexual dissatisfaction isn't the fault of the one who does it, especially if it's causing distress. The husband's response is more concerning because he's not handling the conversation maturely. So, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B. However, maybe there's a nuance. If she approached it in a way that was confrontational or judgmental, that could be a problem. But given the context, she's expressing her own experience and feeling frustrated, which is a legitimate reason to communicate. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes people in relationships avoid discussing such issues, leading to resentment. By bringing it up, she's trying to address a problem that needs solving. The husband's defensiveness is his own response, which doesn't make her wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong). She's advocating for her needs, even if the communication could be improved. The husband's reaction is his responsibility, not hers.\n"
