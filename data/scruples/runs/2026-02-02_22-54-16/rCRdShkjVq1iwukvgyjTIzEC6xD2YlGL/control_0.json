It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. The scenario is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronted her husband about it. He reacted negatively, got angry, and now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife is 24, married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm since October. When they have sex, she's used to not getting pleasure, but today she was extra frustrated and asked her husband when he last had an orgasm. He thought it was a loaded question, which it was. Then she told him it was October. He responded with a groan and anger, blaming himself and feeling attacked. She apologized, but he's still being angry, slamming doors, texting her a lot, and giving half-hearted apologies.\n\nThe main issue here is communication in the marriage. The wife is expressing her frustration about not having sexual satisfaction, which is a legitimate concern. However, the way she approached it by asking a loaded question might have come across as accusatory, which could explain her husband's defensive reaction. But is she in the wrong? Well, she has a right to her feelings and to express them, even if the method wasn't perfect. Her husband's immediate anger and defensiveness might indicate that there are deeper issues, like pressure, insecurity, or not knowing how to handle the conversation constructively.\n\nThe question is whether she was wrong for bringing up the lack of orgasms. The key points are her frustration, her right to sexual satisfaction, and how she communicated it. Maybe the approach could have been better, but the core issue seems to be his inability to discuss it without getting angry. The husband's reaction of slamming doors and not taking responsibility suggests he's not handling the conversation well. So, while she could have framed the question more gently, the main problem lies in his reaction. Therefore, she's not the asshole here.\n"
