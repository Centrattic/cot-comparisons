I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a couple where the wife is not having orgasms and she told her husband. The user is asking if she's in the wrong. \n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key, right? The wife is expressing a problem she's been having for six months. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, and when he responded, he got defensive and angry. \n\nThe user says she apologized for the way she approached it, but he's still upset. The question is whether her approach was wrong. \n\nI need to consider if bringing up her lack of orgasms is a valid concern. It's her right to express dissatisfaction in the relationship, especially regarding intimacy. However, the way she asked might have been a loaded question, which he pointed out. \n\nBut even if the question was loaded, the core issue is her lack of sexual satisfaction. She's not attacking him for no reason. Her husband's reaction seems extreme\u2014getting angry and slamming doors. That suggests he might not be handling the conversation well, but does that make her wrong?\n\nThe user thinks she's not in the wrong. I agree. She's addressing a real issue, even if the method could be improved. The husband's defensiveness is his part of the problem. So the answer should be B.\n"
