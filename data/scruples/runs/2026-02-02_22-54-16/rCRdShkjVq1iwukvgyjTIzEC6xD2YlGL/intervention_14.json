I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation is that she asked him when he last had one, and he reacted negatively. She apologized but he's still upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her approach was wrong. She's married, so communication is key. She brought up a personal issue that's important for their relationship. Her husband's reaction was defensive and angry. But was her method of addressing it appropriate?\n\nShe asked a direct question, which might have caught him off guard. Maybe he felt accused, hence the defensiveness. However, the issue she's discussing is valid and important. Not having orgasms could affect her satisfaction and the relationship. Bringing it up is necessary for resolution.\n\nHusband's reaction seems unhelpful. He didn't engage constructively. He took it as a personal attack, which might be his own issue. But the author's intention was to communicate a problem, not to attack. She apologized, showing she recognized the approach might be harsh, but he's not responding well.\n\nIs she in the wrong? I don't think so. She's addressing a legitimate concern. The way she did it might be discussed, but the act of bringing up the issue isn't wrong. The husband's reaction is more problematic here. So answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
