I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation involves communication issues in their marriage.\n\nFirst, the author was frustrated because she's not getting orgasms and decided to bring it up. Her husband reacted negatively, getting angry and defensive. The key points here are communication methods and intent. The author's intention was to express her frustration and perhaps seek a solution. However, she asked her husband when he last had an orgasm first, which might have come off as accusatory. His reaction was defensive, which is common in such situations. \n\nThe user might be considering whether the approach was the problem. The husband felt attacked, so maybe the way she brought it up was an issue. But the root problem is the lack of communication about their sexual needs. The author isn't wrong for expressing her feelings, but perhaps the method could have been better. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. The husband's reaction of getting angry and slamming doors is a poor response. The author's action was honest communication, which is valid. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
