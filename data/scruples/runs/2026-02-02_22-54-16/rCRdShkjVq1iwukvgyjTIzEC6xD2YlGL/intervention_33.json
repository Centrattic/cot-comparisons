I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The woman brought up a concern that's affecting her physically and emotionally. Not having an orgasm can be a valid issue for someone. She approached it by asking her husband a question first, which might have been a way to open up the conversation. \n\nHer husband's reaction was negative\u2014defensive, angry. He didn't address her concern but instead focused on her approach. The question is whether her method was wrong. She apologized, but he didn't handle it well. \n\nEven if the way she asked was a loaded question, expressing a need isn't wrong. The husband's response was dismissive and hostile. The problem here seems more on his end for not handling the conversation constructively. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for bringing up a legitimate issue. The husband's reaction is the main problem. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
