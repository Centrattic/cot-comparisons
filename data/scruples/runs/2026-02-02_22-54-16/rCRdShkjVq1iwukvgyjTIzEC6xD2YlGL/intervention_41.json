I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (a 24-year-old woman) is in the wrong after telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and asking when the last time he had one was. The husband reacted negatively, got angry, and started shouting. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, communication in a relationship is key. The woman is expressing a concern about her physical and emotional well-being, which is valid. It's important to have open conversations about intimacy issues. However, how the question was approached might have been a factor. She asked when he last had an orgasm, which could be seen as a loaded or accusatory question, leading to his defensive reaction. But the root issue is her lack of satisfaction, which she's trying to address. \n\nThe husband's response seems overly defensive and dismissive. He didn't engage constructively but instead lashed out, making her the problem. That's not a healthy reaction. The woman apologized for the way she asked, which shows she tried to de-escalate the situation, but he continued to act out. The real issue here is the husband's inability to handle the conversation without anger. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for bringing up her feelings and concerns. It's important for both partners to communicate openly. The problem lies more with how the husband responded rather than the initial conversation. So, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
