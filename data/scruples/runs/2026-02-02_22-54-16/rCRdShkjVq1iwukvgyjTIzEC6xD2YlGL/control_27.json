I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation is about communication in a marriage. The author's husband got angry and defensive when she brought up the issue. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author hasn't had an orgasm for a significant period, which is a legitimate concern. She asked her husband when he last had one, which might have been a way to compare or start a conversation about their sexual satisfaction. Her husband's reaction was defensive and angry, which indicates he might have felt attacked.\n\nBut the key here is the approach. The author admitted the question was loaded, which could have been a confrontational way to start the conversation. Maybe she should have approached it more gently, focusing on her own feelings rather than making a comparison. However, bringing up the issue is important for their relationship. The husband's response was inappropriate\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors, and not taking the issue seriously. That points to his poor communication skills rather than the author's fault.\n\nThe husband's half-apologies and continued anger suggest he's not handling the situation well. The author's intent was to express her frustration, which is valid. Even if the approach could have been better, the core issue is the lack of communication and mutual understanding. The husband's reaction is more indicative of the problem here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for initiating the conversation, even if the method wasn't perfect.\n"
