I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation seems to involve communication issues in their marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The woman hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is six months. She's frustrated and asks her husband about when he last had one. His reaction is defensive and angry, leading to conflict. She apologized but he's still upset.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication. The wife brings up her lack of orgasms, which is a sensitive topic. She might have approached it in a way that made him feel attacked. The husband's initial reaction is defensive, which could be due to feeling blamed. But does that mean the wife was wrong to bring it up?\n\nIn relationships, discussing sexual dissatisfaction is important for both partners' well-being. However, the way it's communicated matters. If she phrased it as a confrontational question, like \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" it might have sounded accusatory. Maybe she could have approached it more gently, focusing on her feelings rather than directly comparing their experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction seems disproportionate. Slamming doors and yelling might indicate a deeper issue with how he handles conflict. His response of \"Because I\u2019m SO awful...\" suggests he feels attacked, possibly due to his own insecurities or fear of failure in the relationship. His half-hearted apologies and continued anger could show a lack of willingness to address the underlying issue.\n\nThe author apologized, which shows she recognized the approach might have been harsh. However, just apologizing without addressing the core problem (the lack of orgasms) isn't solving the issue. The husband's response seems more about defensiveness than actually addressing her need for fulfillment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She had a valid reason to express her dissatisfaction, but the method might have been problematic. If her question was accusatory, that could have triggered his defensiveness. However, the husband's reaction is also extreme. The question is whether the author's intent was malicious. Since she mentioned feeling frustrated and just wanted to communicate her feelings, perhaps she wasn't in the wrong. The husband's response was more about how he handled conflict rather than the content of her message.\n\nIn many cases, communication issues in relationships come down to how both parties handle sensitive topics. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to discuss her lack of orgasms, but maybe she could have framed it differently. The husband's response, however, is clearly unhelpful. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband, the answer might be B (No), because bringing up issues is important, and the fault here lies more with the husband's reaction and inability to handle the conversation constructively.\n"
