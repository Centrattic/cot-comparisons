I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. She asked when he last had an orgasm, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is expressing a legitimate concern about her sexual satisfaction, which is important in a relationship. She's not just bringing up a random issue. However, the way she approached it might be part of the problem. She asked a question that could be perceived as accusatory or provocative, especially in the context of their relationship. The husband's reaction was defensive and angry, which suggests he felt attacked. \n\nBut is the wife at fault for being honest about her needs? Open communication is key in relationships, especially regarding intimacy. However, the timing and delivery of the question might have been a factor. She was feeling frustrated, which is understandable, and she might have been seeking a way to address the issue constructively. The husband's immediate defensive reaction and the subsequent argument indicate that there might be underlying issues in how they communicate or handle conflicts. \n\nThe husband's response, like shouting and slamming doors, is not healthy in a relationship. That behavior is more concerning and suggests he's not handling the situation well. The wife apologized for the way she approached it, which shows she's trying to de-escalate the conflict. However, her initial question was a starting point for a difficult conversation. \n\nIs it the wife's fault for bringing up the problem? Probably not. She's voicing her needs, even if the method wasn't perfect. The husband's reaction is more indicative of his own issues with handling criticism or stress. The wife isn't in the wrong for wanting to address a lack of intimacy. The problem might lie more in their communication styles and how they approach sensitive topics. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The wife is trying to communicate a significant issue, and while the approach could be improved, the responsibility isn't entirely on her for the conflict that arose. The husband's overreaction and subsequent behavior are more problematic in this scenario.\n"
