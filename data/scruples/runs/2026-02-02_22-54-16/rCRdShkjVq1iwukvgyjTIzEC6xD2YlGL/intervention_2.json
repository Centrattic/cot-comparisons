I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a woman who tells her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She asks him when he last had one, and he reacts negatively, getting angry and upset. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Open communication is important in a relationship, especially regarding intimacy. The author was trying to address a problem by discussing it. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a loaded question, which he pointed out. Then she shared her frustration, which led to his anger.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, bringing up a sensitive topic like sexual satisfaction is a valid concern. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate and dismissive. Slamming doors, yelling, and not taking responsibility for his part might indicate that he's not handling the communication well. The author apologized, which shows she's trying to resolve the issue. \n\nHowever, the way she asked the question might have been confrontational. Maybe she could have approached it more gently. But the husband's response was not healthy. The key here is that the author is trying to address a legitimate issue. The husband's anger and defensiveness suggest he's not engaging constructively. \n\nSo, even if the author could have worded it better, the core issue isn't her fault. The husband's reaction is more concerning. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
