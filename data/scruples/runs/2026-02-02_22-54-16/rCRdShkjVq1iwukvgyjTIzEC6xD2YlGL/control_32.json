I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decides to tell her husband about it. The key points here are communication, expectations, and reactions.\n\nFirst, the author approached the topic by asking her husband when he last had an orgasm. That's a loaded question, as both acknowledged. The husband's reaction was defensive and angry, which led to conflict. The user is asking if she's the asshole for bringing this up.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is frustrated because she's not experiencing pleasure in their sex life. Communicating this to her husband is important for their relationship. However, the way she approached it might have been confrontational. She used a loaded question, which could have been a tactic to make him aware of her own lack of orgasm by comparing it to his. But this approach might come off as accusatory, which the husband perceived as an attack.\n\nThe husband's reaction was defensive, which is common when someone feels criticized. His anger and the subsequent argument suggest that the communication method wasn't effective. The wife did apologize, but the husband continued to act out. However, the root issue is the lack of orgasms, which is a valid concern for her well-being and satisfaction in the marriage.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the act of communicating a problem isn't inherently wrong, but the method can affect the outcome. The wife's intent was to express her frustration and seek change, which is reasonable. However, the way she framed the question as a loaded one might have been counterproductive. It's possible she could have approached it differently, such as expressing her feelings without comparing it to his experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's response was unhealthy. Slamming doors and blowing up her phone with half-hearted apologies indicates toxic behavior. His defensiveness and anger are not justified if the wife is raising a legitimate concern. The problem isn't solely on her for bringing up the issue but also on the husband's inability to handle the conversation constructively.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the wife's intent was valid, and she wasn't wrong for wanting to address her lack of satisfaction. However, the approach could have been better. But the husband's reaction is more problematic. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The key here is that initiating a conversation about sexual dissatisfaction isn't wrong. The methods might be improved, but the act itself is a reasonable step towards resolving the issue. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
