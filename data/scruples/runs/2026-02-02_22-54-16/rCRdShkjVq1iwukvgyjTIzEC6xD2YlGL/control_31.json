I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She brings it up to her husband, but the conversation goes really poorly. The husband gets angry and starts slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies.\n\nFirst, the author (the wife) is expressing a concern about her lack of orgasms. That's a valid issue in a marriage, especially if it's causing her frustration. Communication problems in relationships are common, but how they're handled matters. She asked when he last had an orgasm, and he felt attacked. Then she told him she hadn't had one since October, which he reacted to with anger. \n\nThe key points here are about communication styles. The husband's reaction seems defensive and possibly dismissive. He didn't handle the conversation well by getting angry and blaming her for attacking him. On the other hand, the wife's approach might have been a bit abrupt. Maybe she could have framed the conversation more gently to express her needs without making him feel defensive. However, the fact that he didn't take her feelings seriously and instead became hostile suggests that he's at fault. \n\nThe wife's main issue is a lack of sexual satisfaction, which is a legitimate concern. The way she approached it might have been a trigger for him, but that doesn't make her wrong for bringing up the issue. If the husband is unwilling to engage constructively, that's his problem. The author isn't the one being unreasonable here. Her apology shows she tried to de-escalate, but his response was excessive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's reaction is more problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her needs, even if the method could be improved. The main issue is the husband's defensiveness and inability to handle the conversation calmly.\n"
