I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. First, I need to consider the context.\n\nThe author is married and hasn't had an orgasm since October. She finally expresses her frustration, asking her husband when he last had one. His reaction is immediate defensiveness, anger, and shutting down. She apologized, but he's still acting out. \n\nThe key points here are communication and emotional response. The author's intent was to express her feelings and initiate a conversation about their sexual relationship. While the way she approached it might have been confrontational, especially by asking a loaded question, that doesn't necessarily make her wrong. Open communication is important in relationships, even if it's difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction seems to be more problematic. His defensiveness and anger might indicate that he's struggling with how to handle the conversation, but reacting with hostility and slamming doors isn't healthy. However, the author's approach could have been more constructive. Instead of leading with a question that she knew might make him defensive, she might have framed it as a concern rather than a comparison.\n\nBut the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she was honest about her feelings, even if the method was a bit blunt, honesty is generally a positive trait. The husband's overreaction is more indicative of the underlying issue. So, in this scenario, the author isn't the asshole. She's trying to address a problem, even if the communication could be improved. The answer should be B.\n"
