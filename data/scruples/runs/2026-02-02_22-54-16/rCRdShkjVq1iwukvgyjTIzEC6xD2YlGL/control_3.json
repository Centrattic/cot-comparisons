I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 24-year-old woman married to a 25-year-old man. She hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to bring it up. She asked her husband when he last had one, and he reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. Now she's wondering if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is expressing a concern about her sexual satisfaction, which is a valid and important issue in a marriage. Not having orgasms can lead to frustration and affect the relationship. She approached the topic by asking her husband a direct question, which he found loaded. He responded with defensiveness and anger, which might indicate that he felt attacked. However, the root problem is her lack of sexual satisfaction, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nNext, her husband's reaction. He immediately took her question as a personal attack, which could be due to communication issues. He didn't seem to engage in a constructive discussion about her lack of orgasms but instead became defensive. His half-assed apology and slamming the door suggest that he's not handling the situation well. The way he responded might be more about his emotional reaction than the issue itself.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. She brought up the issue, which is a part of a healthy relationship. However, the approach might have contributed to the conflict. She asked a question that could be seen as confrontational, especially if it's not a common way to discuss such matters. Maybe a more constructive approach, like expressing her feelings without directly questioning him, could have been better. However, the core issue is that she's not experiencing sexual satisfaction, which is not her fault. \n\nThe husband's reaction is problematic. He should be open to discussing her needs and feelings without taking it as criticism. The fact that he's angry and defensive, and then offers insincere apologies, shows poor communication and a lack of willingness to address the problem. The author was trying to open a dialogue, which is necessary for intimacy and problem-solving in a marriage.\n\nSo, even though the way she asked the question might not have been ideal, the main issue is her husband's response. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to discuss her lack of orgasms. The husband's defensiveness and anger are more indicative of his behavior being the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
