I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronting him about it. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The wife hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is six months. She decides to ask her husband when he last had one, which he interprets as a loaded question. He reacts negatively, getting angry and upset, even slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies. \n\nThe key points here are communication and the approach taken. The wife's intention was to express her frustration, but the way she asked the question might have been abrupt or confrontational. However, the husband's reaction seems overly defensive and dismissive. He didn't take the opportunity to address the underlying issue of her lack of pleasure, which is a valid concern in a relationship. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she had approached the conversation with more empathy or in a non-confrontational setting, maybe the outcome would have been better. But the fact that she hasn't had an orgasm for so long is a significant issue that needs addressing. The husband's response of getting angry and not engaging constructively indicates that he's not handling the situation well. \n\nSo, while her approach might not have been the most effective, she's bringing up a legitimate problem that affects their relationship. The husband's reaction is more indicative of his handling being the issue rather than her initiating the conversation. Therefore, she's not in the wrong here.\n"
