I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's married, hasn't had an orgasm in six months, and she brought it up to her husband. She asked when he last had one, which he took as a loaded question. His reaction was defensive and angry, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, she's sharing a personal issue about her lack of sexual satisfaction. The key here is communication in a relationship. She's trying to address a problem that's been ongoing, which is a valid concern. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She says she asked him when he last had an orgasm, which he perceived as a loaded question. That's interesting because she was actually the one who hasn't had one, but maybe she framed the question in a way that made him feel attacked. For example, if she asked it directly as a comparison, he might feel blamed. But maybe she was just trying to express her own frustration.\n\nHer husband's reaction seems overly defensive. He immediately assumed she was attacking him, which might indicate a communication problem in their relationship. He responded with anger and accusations, which isn't helpful. His behavior of slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies also suggests he's not handling the situation well. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nShe did apologize for the way she approached the question. So maybe she recognized that her initial approach was not the best. The problem is whether her bringing up the issue itself is wrong. Open communication about sexual needs is important in a healthy relationship. If she's not getting satisfaction, it's reasonable to discuss it. But the method of communication matters. If she came at him in a way that made him feel personally attacked, that's a problem. However, given the emotional stakes and the long duration (six months), it's understandable she might be frustrated and want to address it.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She's raising a legitimate issue but possibly not in the most constructive way. However, the husband's reaction is also over the top and unhelpful. The key here is whether her intentions were malicious. She says she was feeling frustrated and wanted to talk about it. She apologized, indicating she's trying to fix the communication. The husband's response is more indicative of a problem in handling feedback. Therefore, she's not necessarily in the wrong for bringing up the issue, but perhaps could have approached it differently. The husband's behavior is more concerning. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
