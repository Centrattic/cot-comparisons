I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (a woman) is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation is a bit complex because it's about a personal relationship issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is six months. She approached her husband about it, asking when he last had one. His reaction was defensive, leading to an argument. The key here is communication in a relationship, especially regarding intimacy issues.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take. I should consider both sides. The author was honest about her feelings, which is important in a relationship. However, the way she approached it might have come off as accusatory. She asked, \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which could be seen as a loaded question, as the husband mentioned. He responded defensively, which might be due to feeling attacked.\n\nBut the root issue is the lack of orgasms for the author. That's a significant problem in the relationship. Bringing it up is necessary for resolution. The husband's reaction\u2014getting angry and defensive\u2014might indicate he's not handling the conversation well. However, the author's method of communication could have been more constructive. Instead of an accusatory question, a more collaborative approach might have been better, like expressing her feelings without blaming him first.\n\nBut is she in the wrong for bringing up a valid issue? Honesty is usually good, but the manner matters. The problem here is that the author didn't express her feelings in a way that invites problem-solving. She started by questioning his last orgasm, which he took as a personal attack. Even if the intent was to discuss their shared issue, the approach triggered a negative response.\n\nHowever, the husband's reaction is also problematic. Slamming doors and being angry might be his way of handling stress, but that's not an excuse for the author to be in the wrong. The core issue is the lack of communication and mutual understanding. Both parties have roles here, but the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's approach could be improved, she's not entirely in the wrong for addressing a valid concern. The husband's response is more indicative of his issues, but the question is about her. Since she was honest, albeit in a potentially harsh way, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
