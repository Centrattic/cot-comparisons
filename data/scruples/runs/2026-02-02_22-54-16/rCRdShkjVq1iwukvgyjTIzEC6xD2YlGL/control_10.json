I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The woman is married, 24, her husband is 25. She hasn't had an orgasm since October. When she brings it up, he reacts negatively. He's defensive, angry, and starts shouting, which escalates the situation. She apologizes, but he keeps slamming doors and sending half-hearted apologies. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and the husband's reaction. The woman is expressing a concern about her sexual satisfaction. Not having orgasms for six months could be a legitimate issue, possibly affecting her well-being. She's trying to communicate this to her husband, which is important for a healthy relationship. \n\nBut how she approached it might be a problem. She asked, \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which she admits is a loaded question. This could have been a confrontational way to bring up the issue. The husband then felt attacked and responded with anger. The wife's approach might have been triggering for him, leading to his defensive reaction.\n\nHowever, the husband's response is also problematic. Getting angry, shouting, slamming doors, and sending dismissive apologies suggests that he's not handling the situation well. Healthy communication involves listening and addressing the issue without defensiveness. His reaction could indicate a lack of willingness to discuss or resolve the problem constructively.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. She's bringing up a legitimate concern, which is important. But the way she framed the question might have been unhelpful. However, she did apologize after realizing the approach was problematic. The husband's reaction is more extreme and harmful. \n\nIn many cases, when one partner has a problem, it's expected to communicate it. The issue here is mutual\u2014both could have handled it better. But the husband's response was more damaging. The wife is seeking validation, but the key is whether her initial action was wrong. Since she's expressing a valid concern and apologized, maybe she's not entirely at fault. However, the way she phrased the question could be seen as provocative. \n\nBut in relationships, communication styles vary. The husband's reaction is more concerning. The wife's action, while perhaps not the best approach, stems from a place of needing to address an issue. So, the answer is probably that she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is worse here.\n"
