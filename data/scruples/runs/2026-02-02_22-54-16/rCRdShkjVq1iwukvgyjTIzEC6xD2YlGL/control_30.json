I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman married to her husband. She says she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. That's a long time for someone in a sexual relationship. She was feeling frustrated and asked her husband when he last had an orgasm. He reacted negatively, calling it a loaded question. Then she told him the truth about herself not having one since October. He got angry, started shouting, and now there's tension.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for bringing this up. Let's think about communication in relationships. Open communication is usually encouraged, especially about intimate issues. If she's not having orgasms, that's a problem that needs addressing. But the way she approached it might have been a factor. She asked him first about his last orgasm, which he found loaded. Maybe he felt defensive or it put him on the spot. Then she revealed her own situation, which could have made him feel criticized. His reaction seems to be anger and defensiveness, which might indicate he's not handling the conversation well, but is that her fault?\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Is it wrong for her to address her lack of satisfaction? 2) Did she handle it in a way that's respectful or not? 3) Should she have approached it differently?\n\nFrom what's described, she was honest but perhaps didn't frame it in a way that's non-confrontational. Maybe she could have started with her own feelings without first asking about him, which might have led to a different reaction. However, she did apologize when he didn't like the approach, so she tried to correct it. His response was anger and door slamming, which is not healthy. But the question is about her being in the wrong.\n\nIn many relationships, bringing up sexual dissatisfaction is important for resolution. The problem might be more about how they communicate rather than the act of bringing it up. If she's honest and seeks to improve their relationship, then she's not in the wrong. However, if she's confrontational without considering his feelings, maybe. But given that she apologized after realizing his discomfort, it seems she tried to adjust. The husband's reaction is more aggressive and defensive, which could indicate his own issues with handling feedback.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing her lack of orgasms. It's a valid concern to raise. The problem might be in the communication style, but the act of bringing up the issue isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
