I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronted her husband about it. The husband reacted angrily, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The wife is expressing a concern about her lack of sexual satisfaction, which is a valid and important issue in a relationship. Open communication about sexual needs is often encouraged in healthy relationships. So, bringing up the topic isn't inherently wrong, even if the husband reacted negatively.\n\nHowever, the way she approached it might be a factor. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which he perceived as a loaded or accusatory question. The husband's response was defensive and angry, which is his reaction, but that doesn't necessarily mean the wife is at fault for bringing up a problem she's experiencing. \n\nIn many cases, partners may struggle with communication, especially around sensitive topics like sex. The wife's frustration is understandable, and her decision to communicate her dissatisfaction is a step towards addressing the issue. The husband's reaction of anger and defensiveness might indicate his own insecurities or communication issues, but that doesn't make the wife wrong for initiating the conversation.\n\nThe key points are whether the wife had a valid reason to bring up the issue and whether her approach was reasonable. Since she's experiencing a significant problem in her marriage, it's reasonable for her to express that. The husband's reaction is problematic, but that doesn't make her the one in the wrong. The question is about whether she's the asshole, not about whether the husband's response is appropriate.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's addressing a legitimate concern and the husband's response is an issue, not her bringing up the problem.\n"
