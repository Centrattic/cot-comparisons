It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a 24-year-old married woman. Her husband is 25. She hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is about six months. She decided to bring this up by asking him when he last had an orgasm. He reacted negatively, thought it was a loaded question, and got angry. She then told him she hadn't had one since October. He responded with frustration, making her feel attacked, and now there's a conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Communication in relationships is important. If there's a problem, discussing it is generally healthy. But the way she approached it might have been a problem. She asked a question that might have been confrontational. Instead of directly expressing her own feelings, she asked him about his last orgasm, which could come off as accusatory. He might have felt blamed, leading to his defensive reaction.\n\nBut on the other hand, not having an orgasm for six months could indicate a problem in the relationship, and it's not her fault if there's an issue. However, how she communicated it might have been the issue. Maybe she should have framed it as her own feelings rather than a question about him. For example, saying \"I haven't been able to reach orgasm lately, and I feel frustrated\" instead of asking about his last time, which could be seen as comparing or blaming.\n\nThe husband's reaction is also a factor. He got angry and defensive, which isn't ideal. However, the way the author approached the topic might have triggered that. So the question is whether her approach was wrong. If she had a valid concern and communicated it in a way that was direct but non-accusatory, that would be better. But in this case, the way she worded it could be seen as confrontational, leading to the husband's defensive reaction. So maybe the author is partly in the wrong for how she approached the topic. But is she entirely in the wrong? Or is the husband also at fault for overreacting?\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, the person is often the asshole if their actions are unnecessarily hurtful or if they didn't consider the other person's feelings. Here, the author's intention was to express a problem, but the method might have been poor. However, having a problem with her not experiencing orgasms is a legitimate issue, and she isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to address it. The husband's reaction of getting angry and slamming doors is also problematic. \n\nBut the key here is the approach. If the question was phrased in a way that made him feel attacked, then maybe the author could have handled it differently. However, not having an orgasm is a personal issue and not necessarily his fault. So maybe the author isn't the asshole, but she could have communicated better. The husband's reaction is also unhelpful. \n\nIn AITA answers, sometimes both parties have some fault, but the question is whether the author is the asshole. The husband's behavior (getting angry, slamming doors) is also a red flag, but the question is about the author's actions. If she had a valid issue and tried to bring it up, even if the method wasn't perfect, she's not the asshole. However, if the approach was clearly accusatory and without considering his feelings, that could be the problem. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the way she asked was the main issue. The husband's response is his own problem, but the author's approach might be the problem. Since she could have phrased it more constructively, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps the way she asked was wrong. But in AITA terms, if the husband overreacted, but the author had a valid reason, the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
