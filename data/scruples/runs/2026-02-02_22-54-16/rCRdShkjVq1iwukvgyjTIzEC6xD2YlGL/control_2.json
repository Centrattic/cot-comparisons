I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a married couple where the woman hasn't had an orgasm in six months and finally tells her husband. She asks him when he last had one, which he takes as a loaded question. He gets angry and upset, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The key points are communication in a relationship, especially regarding intimacy. The woman is clearly frustrated and felt the need to express her lack of satisfaction. Bringing up her own orgasm issues is a valid concern, especially in a marital context where mutual satisfaction is important. Her question might have been phrased in a way that the husband perceived as accusatory, but the core issue is her lack of sexual fulfillment.\n\nHusbands' reaction is to get defensive and angry, which might indicate an issue in how he handles such conversations. Slamming the door and sending half-hearted apologies could be signs of poor conflict resolution. The author apologized for her approach, which shows she's trying to de-escalate, but he's not responding constructively.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong: Is it wrong to express that she's not getting satisfaction? Probably not. Open communication is usually encouraged in relationships. However, the way she approached it might have been a problem. Asking about his last orgasm might come off as a backhanded way to highlight her own issues, which could be seen as a loaded question as he mentioned. But the root problem is her lack of orgasms, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nSo, she's not in the wrong for wanting to address her satisfaction, but maybe the approach could have been more constructive. However, the husband's reaction is more problematic. He's not taking the issue seriously and is being defensive instead of addressing her needs. In that sense, she's not the asshole because she's raising a valid issue, even if the method could be improved. The husband's behavior is more concerning. So the answer should be No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
