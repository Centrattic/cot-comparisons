I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife tells her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The husband reacts negatively, getting angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife hasn't had an orgasm for a long time, which could indicate a problem in their sexual relationship. She approaches her husband about it, which is a valid concern. Communication is key in relationships, especially regarding intimacy. The wife's question was direct but maybe the way she asked it could have been a trigger for her husband. He felt attacked and responded with anger, which is problematic.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should consider both perspectives. The wife's intention was to express her frustration and seek a solution. The husband's reaction was defensive and hurtful. The author apologized, but the husband's response was to slam doors and send half-hearted apologies. \n\nThe key here is whether the wife's approach was wrong. While the question might have been framed in a way that the husband perceived as an attack, the underlying issue is a lack of satisfaction in the relationship. The husband's reaction is more concerning because he didn't address the issue constructively. \n\nIn relationships, bringing up sensitive topics can be difficult, but the husband's anger and defensiveness are not healthy responses. The wife's act of communicating her needs isn't in the wrong. She's seeking to improve their relationship, which is a valid and responsible action. The husband's response is more about defensiveness than problem-solving. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
