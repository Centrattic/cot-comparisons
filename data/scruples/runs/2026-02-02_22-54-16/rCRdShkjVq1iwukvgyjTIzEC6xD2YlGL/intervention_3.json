I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it. The husband reacts negatively, getting angry and upset, and now the wife is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is sharing her frustration about not experiencing sexual satisfaction. That's a legitimate concern for any partner. The question she asked was, \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which she admits was a loaded question. Her husband took it as an attack, which might be a reaction to feeling criticized. \n\nI should think about communication styles here. The wife's approach might have been abrupt or accusatory, depending on her tone. Using a loaded question could be seen as leading or emotionally charged, which might trigger defensiveness. However, she followed up with her own honesty about not having an orgasm since October. \n\nThe husband's response includes a loud groan and a defensive statement, then escalating anger while driving. That's concerning because shouting at her while driving could be dangerous. His reaction of feeling \"awful\" and \"everything is wrong\" indicates he might be taking the conversation as a personal failure rather than a collaborative issue. The half-hearted apologies he later gives don't seem to address her actual concerns, just his own hurt feelings.\n\nThe wife apologized for her approach, which shows she's aware that her method might have been unhelpful, but she's still questioning if she was wrong to bring it up. The key here is the intent versus the delivery. She wanted to address a problem, but her method might not have been the best. However, initiating a conversation about sexual dissatisfaction is a common issue in relationships and not inherently wrong. The husband's reaction is also problematic because he's not handling the conversation constructively. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the question is whether the wife is in the wrong. The husband's behavior\u2014getting angry, shouting during driving, slamming doors, sending multiple messages\u2014seems to be the more severe issue. The wife's initial question, while maybe a bit confrontational, stems from a place of needing to address her own needs. \n\nI think the wife's intention was to start a dialogue about their sexual relationship, which is important for intimacy. The husband's response is dismissive and defensive, which doesn't help resolve the issue. The wife apologizing for the approach might show she's trying to de-escalate, but the husband isn't responding in a way that shows he's open to solving the problem. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because her desire to communicate her needs is valid, even if the method could be improved. The husband's overreaction and lack of constructive response are more indicative of being in the wrong.\n"
