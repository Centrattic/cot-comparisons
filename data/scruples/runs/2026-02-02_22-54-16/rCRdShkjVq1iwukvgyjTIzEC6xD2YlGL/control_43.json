I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and decided to tell her husband. She asked him when he last had an orgasm, and he reacted negatively, getting angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's intention was to communicate her frustration and perhaps seek a solution. She approached the topic by asking a direct question, which her husband took as a loaded or attacking statement. He responded with anger, feeling attacked and criticized. \n\nNow, is she wrong for communicating her feelings? In a healthy relationship, communication is key. If there's an issue like this, it's important to talk about it. However, the way she approached it might have been a problem. She admitted the question was loaded, which could have been a confrontational way to start the conversation. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been better, but her intention wasn't malicious\u2014it was to express her own lack of satisfaction.\n\nOn the other hand, her husband's reaction seems defensive and dismissive. Instead of addressing her needs, he reacted with anger and made her apologize for bringing it up. That's problematic because it shuts down communication. His response doesn't show willingness to work on the problem. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings, even if the method could have been improved. The husband's reaction is more concerning because he's not engaging constructively. The key issue here is that the husband is not open to addressing the problem, which is more of a red flag. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
