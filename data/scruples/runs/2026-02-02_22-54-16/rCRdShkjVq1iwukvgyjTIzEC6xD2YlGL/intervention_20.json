I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The author brings up a personal and sensitive topic, which is her lack of orgasms. She does this by first asking her husband when he last had one, which he perceives as a loaded question. Her husband's reaction is anger and defensiveness, leading to conflict.\n\nI need to consider if her approach was appropriate. The author might have been trying to open a dialogue about their intimacy, but the way she framed it could have been more constructive. Instead of starting with a question that could make her husband feel attacked, maybe a more direct and non-confrontational approach would have been better. For example, expressing her feelings without comparing to his experiences first.\n\nHowever, the husband's overreaction is also significant. He responded with anger, making her the target, which shows a lack of willingness to engage in a healthy conversation. His defensiveness and refusal to address the issue properly (like slamming doors and half-hearted apologies) indicate he's not handling the situation well.\n\nThe author apologized for her approach, but the husband's reaction escalated the situation. The core issue is the lack of satisfaction in the marital relationship, which is her right to express. While the method could be improved, the content of her message\u2014expressing a valid concern\u2014isn't wrong. \n\nSo, while the author might have approached it in a way that could be seen as confrontational, the underlying issue is valid. The husband's response is more problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for bringing up a legitimate concern about their intimacy. Therefore, the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
