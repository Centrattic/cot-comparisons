I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after telling her husband that she hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronting him about it. She says she was feeling frustrated and asked him when he last had one. He reacted angrily, and she's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is married and has been experiencing a lack of orgasms for several months, which can be a significant issue in a relationship. Communication about sexual satisfaction is important, and it's reasonable for her to express her feelings. However, the way she approached the question might have been problematic. She framed it as a loaded question, which her husband immediately recognized. His reaction was defensive and angry, which complicates the situation.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication styles and the intent behind the question. The author's intent was to express her frustration and perhaps seek a solution, but the way she phrased the question (\"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\") might have come across as accusatory or judgmental. This could have triggered her husband's defensiveness. However, the fact that she followed up with her own experience (since October) shows she's being honest about her own issues, which is important.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction seems extreme. Slamming doors, shouting, and sending half-hearted apologies are not healthy responses. If he's truly concerned about their relationship, he should address the issue constructively rather than react with anger. His response might indicate that he feels attacked, but it's also possible he's unaware of the underlying problem or doesn't know how to handle it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to assess if her approach, while perhaps not the most effective, was inconsiderate or deliberately harmful. Open communication about sexual issues is crucial, and avoiding the topic can lead to resentment. The author's frustration is valid, and bringing it up, even if the method was blunt, is a step towards addressing the problem. However, the way she framed the question might have been perceived as a personal attack, which could be where the husband's defensiveness comes from.\n\nIn relationships, how we communicate is as important as what we communicate. The author might have been better off discussing her feelings without leading with a question that could be seen as confrontational. Instead of asking when he last had an orgasm, she could have approached it by expressing her own lack of satisfaction and asking for his perspective. That might have been a more constructive way to start the conversation.\n\nBut given that the core issue is her lack of sexual satisfaction and her attempt to address it, even if her method wasn't perfect, she's not the one in the wrong. The husband's overreaction and inability to handle the conversation maturely suggest that he's more at fault in this scenario. The author's intention was to open up about a personal and sensitive topic, which is a valid step in a relationship. The problem lies in how both parties handled the conversation. However, the burden of being the \"asshole\" here might fall more on the husband's reaction than the author's initial question.\n"
