I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The woman brought up a sensitive topic, which is common in marriages. She asked her husband about his last orgasm, which he found loaded. Then she shared her own experience, which led to his anger.\n\nHer approach might have been abrupt, especially since they were driving. Maybe the timing wasn't ideal. But the core issue is her lack of orgasms. That's a legitimate concern for her well-being and the relationship's health. \n\nHer husband's reaction seems defensive and angry. He didn't address the issue but instead blamed her for attacking him. His half-apologies and slamming doors suggest he's not handling the situation maturely. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. She expressed a problem honestly, even if it was direct. The husband's response is more concerning because he's not engaging constructively. So, she's not the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
