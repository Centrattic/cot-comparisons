I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe woman is married and hasn't had an orgasm in six months. She's frustrated and asks her husband when he last had an orgasm. He reacts negatively, gets angry, and the situation escalates. The main question is whether she's at fault here.\n\nFirst, communication in relationships is crucial. Bringing up issues is important for resolving them. If she's not having orgasms, that's a legitimate concern. However, the way she approached it might have been problematic. She asked a question that might have been confrontational. The husband felt attacked, which is a red flag. He responded with anger and defensiveness instead of addressing the issue. \n\nBut the root problem here is the lack of sexual satisfaction. It's her right to express her needs. However, the timing and phrasing could be an issue. She might have approached it more constructively. But the user is asking if she's in the wrong. The husband's reaction is also concerning because he's dismissing her feelings and not taking responsibility. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the key is whether her actions were reasonable. She's sharing a legitimate concern but maybe the method could be improved. However, the husband's response is the bigger issue. He's not listening and is being defensive. So while she might not phrase it perfectly, she's not in the wrong for bringing up the issue. The husband is failing to address her needs and reacting negatively. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
