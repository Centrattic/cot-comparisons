I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The wife asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, and he reacted negatively, interpreting it as an attack. She then told him she hasn't had one since October, which led to his anger and defensive behavior. The key points here are communication styles and mutual understanding in a relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, so I should evaluate if her approach was reasonable. Bringing up a sensitive topic like sexual dissatisfaction can be tricky. The question is loaded, as the husband pointed out, which might have triggered his defensive response. However, the wife is expressing a genuine concern that's affecting her well-being. \n\nIs she at fault for not having orgasms? Not really; that's a personal experience. The issue is how she communicated it. Starting with a loaded question might not be the best approach. Maybe a more direct and less confrontational way would have been better. But is that making her the asshole? Or is the husband's reaction problematic?\n\nHusbands' response was defensive and angry, which indicates possible communication issues in the relationship. If he's not open to discussing sexual issues, that's his problem. The wife might have needed a different method, but the act of communicating her need isn't wrong. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the approach was wrong. While the question was loaded, the intent was to address a real problem. The husband's overreaction is more concerning. The wife isn't the asshole for trying to address her lack of satisfaction. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
