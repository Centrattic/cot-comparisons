I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who asked their husband about not having orgasms is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and brought it up, but the husband reacted angrily. The question is whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is in a marital relationship and has a legitimate concern about her sexual satisfaction. Not having orgasms for an extended period can be a significant issue, affecting both partners' well-being. She approached the topic directly but perhaps in a way that the husband perceived as accusatory. When she asked about his last orgasm, he felt attacked, which led to his hostile response. \n\nNow, the key points here are the intent and the communication. The wife's intent was to express her frustration and share her experience, which is a valid concern. However, the way she framed the question might have come across as confrontational. The husband's reaction is problematic because he responded with anger and defensiveness instead of addressing the issue constructively. \n\nBut the question is whether the wife is in the wrong. If her intention was to communicate her needs and improve their relationship, then she's not at fault for expressing her feelings. However, if she approached the topic in a way that was meant to blame or criticize without considering his feelings, that could be an issue. The scenario mentions that the husband felt attacked, but the wife apologized afterward, indicating she tried to de-escalate the situation. \n\nIt's important to note that the husband's response\u2014slamming doors, shouting, and sending half-hearted apologies\u2014is indicative of poor conflict resolution. The wife's action was a reasonable attempt to address a problem, even if the delivery could have been improved. The husband's reaction is more indicative of his inability to handle criticism, which is on him. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the wife's action isn't malicious. She's sharing her experience to seek a solution. The husband's behavior is more harmful because he's dismissing her feelings and reacting with aggression. Therefore, the wife isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
