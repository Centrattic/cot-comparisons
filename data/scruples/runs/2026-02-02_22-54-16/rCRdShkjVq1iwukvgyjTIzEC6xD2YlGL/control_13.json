I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife hasn't had an orgasm since October. She asked her husband when he last had one, which she admits was a loaded question. He reacted negatively, getting angry and upset. She apologized but he's still acting out. She wants to know if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the core issue is communication in their sex life. The author's intention was to express her frustration and perhaps seek help or understanding. However, the way she approached it\u2014by asking about his last orgasm\u2014might have triggered him. He responded with anger, blaming her for attacking him. \n\nIs she wrong for bringing up the issue? Well, communication is key in relationships. If there's a problem, it's important to address it. But the method matters. Asking a loaded question can make the other person defensive. Maybe she could have approached it differently, like expressing her feelings without comparing their experiences. That might have been less confrontational.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction seems overly defensive. He's taking her honest feedback personally, which isn't healthy. He should be open to discussing their intimacy issues without becoming hostile. His anger and subsequent actions (slamming doors, blowing up her phone) are not constructive. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be the way she phrased the question, but the husband's reaction is also problematic. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she was trying to communicate a problem, even if not perfectly, she isn't entirely at fault. The husband's response was more about defensiveness and not taking responsibility. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). But she could improve her communication style. The main issue is his reaction, not her initial honesty.\n"
