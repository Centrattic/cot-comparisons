I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, communication in relationships is key. The author brought up a personal issue, which is her lack of orgasms. That's a valid concern because sexual satisfaction is important in a marriage. She asked her husband when he last had an orgasm, which might have been a way to start a conversation about their intimacy. \n\nHer husband's reaction seems pretty negative\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors. That's not healthy. If she's not getting satisfaction, it's important for her to express that. However, the way she approached it might have been a problem. She said she asked \"When's the last time you had an orgasm?\" which could come off as accusatory. Maybe she could have framed it more as a shared problem rather than pointing fingers.\n\nBut the core issue is her lack of orgasms. That's a legitimate problem. The husband's response of feeling attacked and getting defensive isn't helpful. The author apologized, but he's still acting out. So, while her approach might have been a bit sharp, the underlying issue is valid. The husband's overreaction seems to be the bigger issue here. So the author probably isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
