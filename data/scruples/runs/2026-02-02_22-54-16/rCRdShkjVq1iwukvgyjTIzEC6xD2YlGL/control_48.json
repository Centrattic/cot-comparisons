I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation involves communication issues in their marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The wife is frustrated because she hasn't had an orgasm in a while and decides to bring it up. Her husband reacts negatively, becoming angry and defensive. He accuses her of attacking him and not being satisfied with his efforts. \n\nThe key points here are communication styles and mutual respect. The wife approached the topic directly, which might have been a loaded question as her husband mentioned. However, discussing sexual satisfaction is important in a relationship. The husband's reaction seems extreme\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors, and sending insincere apologies. His response indicates a lack of willingness to address the issue constructively.\n\nBut is the wife in the wrong? Well, bringing up a problem is not inherently wrong. The way she approached it could be a factor. Maybe she could have used a softer approach or discussed it when both were calm. However, the husband's reaction is more concerning. His defensiveness and anger without trying to understand her perspective are harmful. The wife's intention was to communicate her needs, which is valid. The husband's response is more indicative of the problem here. \n\nThe question is whether the wife is in the wrong. Since she's initiating a conversation about her sexual satisfaction, which is her right, and the husband's reaction is the main issue, the answer would be B (Not the Asshole). She's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings, even if her approach could be improved. The husband's behavior is the main problem, not her for speaking up.\n"
