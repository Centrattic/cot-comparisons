I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation involves communication issues in the marriage. The author brought up a sensitive topic, and the husband reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's approach was appropriate. She asked about his last orgasm, which is a loaded question, and he got defensive. But since she hasn't had one herself, bringing it up might be a way to address the issue. However, the way she approached it might have been confrontational, especially while he was driving, which isn't ideal. \n\nHis reaction was anger and defensiveness, which suggests he felt attacked. But he didn't address her concern about her own lack of pleasure. Maybe the problem is that he's not listening to her needs. The author apologized, but he kept being hostile. \n\nIn terms of fault, the husband's reaction seems inappropriate. The author was trying to communicate a problem, which is important for a healthy relationship. Even if the method wasn't perfect, the core issue is about intimacy and satisfaction. The husband's response of anger and defensiveness is a bigger issue here. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; the problem is more about how the husband handled the conversation. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
