I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is married, both young. The wife hasn't had an orgasm in six months and confronts her husband by asking when he last had one. He reacts negatively, getting angry and defensive. The author is wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points are communication and the approach. The author brought up a sensitive topic during a drive, which might not be the best setting for a serious conversation. Her husband felt attacked, which is a common reaction to being criticized, especially if the approach is confrontational. \n\nBut wait, the author's intention was to express her frustration. She might have felt it's important to communicate her needs. However, the way she approached it\u2014maybe with a loaded question in a public or stressful setting like driving\u2014could have contributed to his defensiveness. \n\nIn relationships, how you communicate is as important as what you communicate. If the author had a valid concern (lack of intimacy), she might not be in the wrong for bringing it up. But the method of bringing it up during a drive, using a question that the husband perceived as loaded, might have been a mistake. \n\nThe husband's reaction is also problematic. Getting angry and shutting down the conversation isn't healthy. But the author's approach could have exacerbated the situation. \n\nSo, is she wrong? Not necessarily. She had a right to express her feelings. But the way she did it might have been an error in communication. However, the husband's response was also inappropriate. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether her method was fair. If she was trying to be honest but approached it poorly, maybe she's not in the wrong but could improve her communication. Alternatively, if her approach was confrontational and led to his defensiveness, she might share some responsibility. \n\nIn AITA situations, the focus is often on whether the person did something to deserve the backlash. Here, the author's intention was to address a problem, even if the method was flawed. The husband's reaction seems over the top. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but with the caveat that she could have communicated better. \n\nBut the question is strictly whether she's in the wrong. Since she was honest about her feelings and brought up a valid concern, even if the timing or method was off, the main issue is her husband's reaction. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
