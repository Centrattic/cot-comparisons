I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman is 24, married to a 25-year-old. She hasn't had an orgasm since October, which is six months. She was feeling frustrated and asked her husband when he last had an orgasm. His reaction was defensive and angry, leading to conflict. She shared her experience, apologized for the approach, but he's still upset. She's seeking validation on whether she's the asshole (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. \n\nThe key points here are communication in a relationship. The author is expressing a personal issue that's affecting her. Asking her husband about the last time he had an orgasm might have been a loaded question, as he pointed out. However, her motivation was to address a problem she's been facing. The husband's reaction is defensive and hostile, which might indicate he's not handling the conversation well. \n\nBut was her approach wrong? She initiated the conversation because she's frustrated. It's possible that her directness was a mistake, but the core issue is her lack of orgasms, which is a valid concern. The husband's response\u2014getting angry and defensive\u2014might suggest he's not open to discussing the issue constructively. However, the author's intent was to communicate a problem, which is not inherently wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial, but the method matters. The author might have approached it in a way that made her husband feel attacked, but the underlying issue is a legitimate one. Since both partners should work on improving their communication, the fault isn't entirely on the author. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Her intent was to address a problem, even if the timing or approach could be improved. The husband's reaction is the bigger issue here. So the answer should be B.\n"
