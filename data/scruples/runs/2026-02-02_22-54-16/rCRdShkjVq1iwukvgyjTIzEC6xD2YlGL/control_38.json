I\u2019m a 24 y/o female married to a 25 y/o man. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in six months. It was October the last time I can remember. \n\nMost days my husband and I have sex I\u2019m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him \n\n\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had an orgasm?\u201d \n\nHe immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with \u201cI haven\u2019t had one since October.\u201d \n\nHis first response was a loud groan and \u201cBecause I\u2019m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?\u201d Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn\u2019t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he\u2019s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me\u201d. \n\nI may just be here for validation but seriously. Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her husband she hasn't had an orgasm in six months. The situation is about communication in a marriage. The husband's reaction seems pretty intense\u2014getting angry, shouting, slamming doors. The author's question was about her own experience, which is a valid concern in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had a right to express her feelings. She's not criticizing his performance per se, but stating her own lack of satisfaction. That's a personal issue, so she's not attacking him directly. The problem might be in how she approached it. She asked when he last had an orgasm, which could be seen as leading with a loaded question. But then she revealed her own situation. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems more about defensiveness and emotional response rather than the content of her statement. His anger and blaming her for attacking him might indicate he's not handling the conversation well. The author apologized, but his subsequent behavior (slamming doors, half-hearted apologies) shows he's not resolving the issue constructively.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is sharing her experience, which is her right. The husband's reaction is the issue here. The question is whether she was wrong to communicate her needs. I think she's not in the wrong because she's being honest about her feelings. The husband's response is problematic, but the act of communication itself isn't the fault. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
