Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where one member, Sarah, is taking too long to do her turns because she's slow at math. The author wants to know if they're an asshole for suggesting removing Sarah from the group.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a D&D group with Adam, who invited his coworker Sarah. Sarah's taking way longer than others to do the math during her turns, which is causing the game to drag. The group tried giving her another chance after Adam tried helping her at work, but it didn't help. Eventually, Sarah had a breakdown and left.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. They argue that the author was frustrated because the game was taking too long, and Adam was the one who invited Sarah. But now they feel guilty because Sarah left upset.\n\nTo evaluate whether the author is in the wrong, I should consider a few angles. Is the math required for D&D a reasonable expectation? D&D does involve a lot of calculations, so maybe the author isn't being unreasonable in their expectations. However, the group tried to accommodate her by giving her more time and even another chance after Adam's attempt to help. The problem is that the group's patience was tested, and they ended up hurting Sarah's feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the group's approach. They texted about removing her, which might not have been the best way. Giving her another chance was good, but when they asked Adam to help, it backfired because it caused pressure and frustration. The author might be in the wrong for not considering alternative solutions, like helping Sarah themselves or slowing down the game pace for everyone to be more inclusive.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Sarah is significant. The group's actions led to her breaking down and leaving. The author was the main driver of removing her and felt frustrated, but the consequences were negative. That guilt is a valid point. The group didn't try enough accommodations, maybe. They could have adapted the game in other ways, like using pre-calculated numbers or apps for math, to make it more accessible for Sarah.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. The game sessions were taking too long, and it wasn't fun for the group. But the way they handled it\u2014texting about removal and pressuring Adam to help\u2014might have contributed to the problem. The key is whether the author acted unkindly or without considering other options.\n\nIn the end, the group's actions caused Sarah to leave upset. Even though the author's intentions were to keep the game enjoyable for everyone, the outcome was harmful. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't find a middle ground that respected both the group's time and Sarah's ability to participate comfortably.\n"
