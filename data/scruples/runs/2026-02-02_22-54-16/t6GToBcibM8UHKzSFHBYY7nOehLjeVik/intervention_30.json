Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D group where a player, Sarah, is being asked to leave because she's too slow at doing the math required for her turns. The author is the one who pushed for her removal, and now they're feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D is a game that involves a lot of math, even if it's simple. The group has been playing together for two years, and they invited Sarah through Adam. The problem is Sarah's slow turns, which are causing the game to drag. They tried to give her another chance, but after that, she got frustrated and ended up crying. The author is questioning if they were wrong to push for her removal.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their game without long delays. The session time is limited (3-4 hours), and Sarah's slow turns are reducing the fun for everyone else. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since the game's pace is affected. But on the other hand, Sarah was genuinely having fun, even if her math was slow. They did try to help her by having Adam assist her, but that didn't work out, and it actually made her more frustrated.\n\nThe key points here are whether the group handled the situation with empathy and whether there were other options. The group did give her a chance and tried to address the issue before removing her. However, the way they went about it might have been harsh. They didn't consider if there were other accommodations they could make, like allowing the use of a calculator or having someone help her during the game. The fact that Sarah started to cry and left in tears suggests that the approach was hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author was the main person pushing for her removal, which shows they were the most impatient. While group dynamics are important, it's possible that the author didn't consider Sarah's feelings or possible solutions that could have kept her in the group. The group's action led to her leaving, which might have been avoidable with more patience or alternative strategies.\n\nSo, while the group's frustration is valid, their handling of the situation may have been inconsiderate. The author, as the main instigator, might have a share of the blame for not exploring other options and for creating a stressful environment that led to Sarah's emotional breakdown. Therefore, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy and consideration for Sarah's feelings, even if the initial issue was about game pace.\n"
