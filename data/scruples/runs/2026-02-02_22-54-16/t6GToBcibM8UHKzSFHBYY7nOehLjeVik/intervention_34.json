Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she couldn't do math quickly enough. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group plays D&D every week with six people. Adam brought his coworker Sarah to join. D&D requires a lot of math, which isn't hard but is frequent. Sarah takes much longer than others\u2014up to 7-8 minutes per turn, which is causing the game to drag. The group tried to give her another chance with Adam's help, but she didn't improve and got frustrated, leading to a breakdown.\n\nThe author felt it was necessary to remove her to keep the game fun for everyone. But after she left, they feel guilty. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their game without excessive delays. D&D is known for taking time, but if one person is significantly slowing down the whole session, it affects everyone's experience. The author's frustration might be justified because the game time is being wasted, leading to shorter actual gameplay. Also, they gave Sarah a chance to improve by having Adam help her, which shows they tried to accommodate her.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah was having fun, and the situation led to her crying and leaving, which is clearly hurtful. The author's approach might have been too harsh. Maybe there were other ways to handle it, like using calculators or apps to speed up the math, or having someone else handle her calculations if she's uncomfortable. The way they handled her removal might have been abrupt and not considerate enough of her feelings.\n\nBut the problem is the math speed itself. It's a game that requires some math, so expecting a certain level of efficiency could be reasonable. However, if someone isn't good at that, maybe the group should adapt the game mechanics to be more inclusive. The author's primary issue is that the game isn't fun anymore due to the time delays. But the method of handling it might be the problem here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they had a legitimate reason (the game not being fun due to delays) and tried to address it by giving her a chance, but the outcome was negative, maybe they aren't entirely wrong. However, maybe they could have been more compassionate or found alternative solutions. The key points are whether the math is a necessary part of the game and if there were other accommodations possible.\n\nIn the end, the decision to remove her might be justified in terms of the group's enjoyment, but the handling of it was poor, leading to emotional harm. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's main concern was the group's experience and they tried a solution, but it didn't work, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's room for debate. However, if the group could have made more allowances or if the author was too rigid, maybe A (in the wrong). \n\nI think the core issue is that the group's need for a smooth game time versus Sarah's ability. The math isn't that hard, but she's just slow. If it's causing the game to be unenjoyable for the group, they have a right to address it. The author's main fault might be not considering other solutions before removing her, but if they tried and it didn't work, maybe they're not wrong. So I lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
