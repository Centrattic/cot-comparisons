Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking much longer than others to do her turns because of math difficulties. The author wanted her kicked out because it's slowing down the game. They tried giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work, and Sarah ended up upset and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, D&D requires some math, and if someone can't keep up, it affects everyone's experience. The group is spending 3-4 hours a week, and they only get 90 minutes of actual gameplay because of her. That's a lot of time lost, and it's frustrating. The author was frustrated and tried to address it, leading to the group's decision.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah genuinely enjoyed the game, and the group's actions led to her emotional breakdown. The author was the main push for removing her, which might have been harsh. They tried to give her another chance, but the approach might not have been empathetic enough. Maybe they could have found alternative solutions, like pre-rolling dice or using apps to speed things up. Also, the way the situation was handled made Sarah feel pressured and frustrated, which is unfortunate.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty now, which indicates they recognize the negative impact. But was their initial action wrong? It's a group decision, so maybe the problem isn't just the author. However, the author's frustration and insistence might have contributed more. The key points are the impact on group time versus the impact on Sarah's feelings. It's a tough balance. While the group has a right to enjoy their game, the way they handled it could have been more compassionate. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement in how they approached the situation. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they had valid frustrations, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
