Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of the D&D group because she couldn't do math quickly. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. On one hand, Sarah's slow turns were causing significant delays and affecting the enjoyment of the entire group. D&D is a social activity that relies on everyone's participation and timely input. If one person is taking excessively long, it can disrupt the flow and make the game less fun for others. The group tried to accommodate her by giving her another chance, and even suggested Adam help her at work. But that didn't work, and Sarah became more frustrated, leading to her emotional breakdown.\n\nOn the other hand, the author and the group's approach might have been harsh. They didn't provide Sarah with alternative solutions to help her improve, like using a calculator or pre-rolling dice. The fact that Sarah was having fun even while struggling suggests she was invested in the game. The decision to remove her led to her crying and leaving, which is a serious outcome. The author acknowledges their guilt, indicating that the action had negative consequences they hadn't anticipated.\n\nThe key points here are intent and alternatives. The group's intention was to maintain the game's pace and their enjoyment, which is valid. However, they might have handled it better by exploring other solutions before removing her. The author's frustration is understandable, but the outcome was hurtful. It's a balance between group dynamics and individual needs. The question is whether the action of kicking her out was the wrong choice, given that they tried to help and she still couldn't keep up. But maybe they could have been more patient or found different ways to assist her. Since the result was Sarah's emotional distress, the author's action might be seen as the wrong approach, even if the initial problem was valid.\n"
