Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where one member, Sarah, is taking too long to do the math during the game, causing others to lose time and become frustrated. The group eventually removes her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The author was the main person pushing for her removal and now feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not overly complex. The problem here is that Sarah is significantly slower than others, making the game drag. The group tried to help her by having Adam (her coworker who introduced her) assist her, but that didn't work. Eventually, the group removed her, but it ended up hurting her feelings and making her cry. The author is now questioning if they were wrong to push for her removal.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? On one hand, the group had a legitimate issue: the game was taking too long because of Sarah's pace. They might have felt that their time was being wasted. On the other hand, the way they handled it led to emotional harm. The author was the main driver behind removing Sarah, which caused her distress. Even though they tried to help her improve first, the outcome was negative.\n\nI think the key here is whether the group's actions were considerate. They did give her a chance through Adam's help, but maybe they should have approached it more directly with Sarah instead of letting Adam handle it. Also, when the situation escalated, they should have found another solution before cutting her off. The author's frustration is understandable, but the emotional impact on Sarah is significant. The fact that Sarah was having fun but couldn't keep up the pace might mean the group should have found a way to accommodate her, like using calculators, simplifying the math, or taking turns in a different way. Removing her, even if it's for the group's enjoyment, wasn't the best approach. The author's guilt is valid because their actions contributed to her distress. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy and consideration for Sarah's feelings, even if the initial problem was legitimate.\n"
