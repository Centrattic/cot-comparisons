Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she was slow at math.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D involves a lot of math, and Sarah was taking much longer than others to take her turns. The group had tried giving her chances and even suggested a solution where Adam tried to help her at work. When that didn't work, the situation escalated, leading to Sarah crying and leaving. \n\nThe author feels guilty for being the main push to remove her. So, the key points here are whether the group's actions were justified or if they handled it poorly. \n\nOn one hand, the game time is a shared activity, and if one person's pace is significantly slowing everyone else down, it's understandable that the group might want to address it. They did make an effort to help her improve, which shows they weren't just being harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the way they handled the removal might have been insensitive. The pressure led Sarah to become frustrated and emotional, which indicates that the approach could have been more empathetic. Maybe there were alternative solutions, like allowing her to use a calculator or adjust the complexity of her character's actions. \n\nThe author's guilt suggests they realize their part in the situation. However, the decision to remove her might have been necessary for the group's enjoyment, but the execution could have been better. It's a mix of both factors, but the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" \n\nConsidering that the group tried to help and communicated their concerns, but the outcome was hurtful to Sarah, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the emotional impact on Sarah is significant. The answer hinges on whether the group's needs outweighed Sarah's enjoyment. Since D&D is a social activity, balancing both is crucial. The author's primary push to remove her might be seen as contributing to the problem, but the situation is complex. \n\nGiven that the group made efforts to accommodate her and the main issue was the game's pace, the author isn't in the wrong entirely. The answer is B.\n"
