Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's think about this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where one member, Sarah, is taking too long because she can't do the math quickly. The group decided to kick her out after she had a breakdown.\n\nFirst, the key points here: D&D involves math, which is part of the game. Sarah's slow pace was causing the game to drag, and the group tried to give her another chance by having Adam (her coworker and friend) help her. But that didn't work, and Sarah ended up upset. The poster feels guilty but wonders if they were right to remove her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the poster (the one who pushed for removing Sarah) is in the wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, the group had a valid concern about the game's flow. D&D is a group activity that requires everyone's participation, and if one person is significantly slowing things down, it affects the whole group's experience. They tried to accommodate her by giving her time and even having Adam help, which shows they made an effort. However, their approach might have been harsh. Instead of kicking her out, maybe they could have found alternative solutions, like using precomputed numbers or apps to assist with calculations. The fact that Sarah was having fun but then became frustrated and cried suggests that the method of removal was hurtful. \n\nBut the poster's main issue is that Sarah's inability to perform the math was disrupting the game. The group's responsibility to their own enjoyment is a factor here. However, the way they handled it\u2014publicly removing her and causing emotional distress\u2014might be where they went wrong. The poster might not be in the wrong for wanting to address the issue but could have been more considerate in their approach. \n\nOn the other hand, if the group communicated their concerns privately first, maybe offered tools to help Sarah, or adjusted their game style, they might have found a better solution. The fact that they only gave one more chance and then removed her, leading to her breakdown, suggests that the method was too abrupt. \n\nSo, the poster's actions were driven by frustration and a desire to maintain the game's pace, but the execution lacked empathy and possible problem-solving. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively.\n"
