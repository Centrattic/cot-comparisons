Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a D&D group where one member, Sarah, is taking too long to do the math during her turns. The author, along with the group, decided to kick her out after she started getting frustrated and crying. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not super complex\u2014adding numbers, checking stats, etc. Sarah has been playing for a few months and still takes 7-8 minutes per turn, which is way longer than others. The group tried to give her another chance, with Adam helping her during work lunch, but that didn't work. Eventually, Sarah had a breakdown and left.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for kicking her out because of her inability to do math quickly. The main factors to consider are: Was the group's decision to remove Sarah justified? Did they handle the situation appropriately? And was the author wrong in pushing for her removal?\n\nOn one hand, the group's frustration is understandable. D&D sessions are time-limited, and one person taking too long can disrupt the flow and enjoyment for everyone else. The author mentions that each session only gets about 90 minutes of actual playtime because of this. The group did try to help Sarah improve by having Adam assist her, but that didn't work. They also considered Adam's work relationship with Sarah and tried to be sensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, removing someone from a social group can be a big deal. Sarah was having fun, even if she was slow. The fact that she started crying and storming off suggests that the pressure was too much for her. The author admits feeling guilty now, which shows some remorse. The question is whether the group's actions were overly harsh or if they had a valid reason to maintain the game's pace.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the group address the issue with Sarah before deciding to kick her out? The account doesn't mention if they had a direct conversation with her about the turn times. They might have assumed Adam's help would suffice, but maybe Sarah needed more support or accommodations. Also, the fact that she was getting frustrated and then snapped indicates that the pressure was affecting her negatively.\n\nSo, considering all this, the group might have handled it poorly. They could have tried more ways to help her, like allowing her to use a calculator, assigning someone to assist her during the game, or taking turns to help her calculate. Removing her outright might have been a last resort, but perhaps there were other solutions they didn't explore first. The author was the main person pushing for her removal and seems to have been the most frustrated, which might make them more responsible here.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether the author's actions were unnecessarily cruel or inconsiderate. The intention was to maintain game time, but the outcome was hurting Sarah emotionally. The group didn't make it clear how important the math speed was before inviting her, and maybe they should have adjusted the game to accommodate her instead of removing her. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle it with enough empathy and didn't explore all possible solutions before kicking her out.\n"
