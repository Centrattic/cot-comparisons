Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where a player, Sarah, is struggling with the math involved in the game, causing delays and frustration. The author, along with the group, decided to remove Sarah after she became upset and left in tears.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author's actions were justified. D&D does require some math, but it's not overly complex. Sarah had formulas written down, so it's not a matter of not knowing the rules. Her slowness was affecting the game's flow, leading the group to consider her removal. However, after an attempt to help her (Adam's lunchtime sessions), she became frustrated and emotional, leading to her departure.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics. The group's primary goal is to have fun together. If one member's participation is causing significant delays and disrupting the experience for everyone else, it's a legitimate concern. The author was frustrated, which is understandable. But the way they handled it might be the problem. They gave Sarah a chance with Adam's help, but when that didn't work, they proceeded to remove her, leading to her emotional breakdown.\n\nThe group's approach might have been too abrupt. Instead of removing her, maybe they could have explored other solutions, like pre-rolling dice or using apps to speed up calculations. Also, the fact that Sarah was having fun despite the struggles suggests that the group's decision might have been harsh. The author's guilt indicates they realize the emotional impact on Sarah.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The group might not have discussed the issue privately with Sarah first, offering support or alternatives rather than a ultimatum. By involving Adam and then cutting her off without a more compassionate approach, they might have ignored her feelings and needs.\n\nSo, while the author had valid concerns about the game's pace, the method of resolving it by removing Sarah without exhausting other options could make them the asshole. They prioritized their own enjoyment over Sarah's well-being, and the outcome was hurtful. Therefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
