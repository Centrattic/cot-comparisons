Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where Sarah, a new player invited by Adam, is taking too long to do the math during her turns. The author, who is part of the group, was the main one pushing to remove her because she was slowing down the game. After giving her another chance with Adam's help didn't work, Sarah got frustrated and left in tears. Now the author feels guilty and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. D&D requires a lot of math, but Sarah struggles with the mental calculations. The group gave her time to adjust, but her turns were still too slow. The author and the group tried a compromise with Adam helping her at work, but that didn't work. The result was Sarah being upset and leaving. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author handle the situation correctly? Was it fair to remove Sarah because of her math skills? The author's frustration is understandable since the game's pacing is affected. However, the approach taken might have been harsh. They did give her another chance, but when that failed, the outcome was negative. \n\nThe author's primary issue is that they were the main person pushing for Sarah's removal. Even though the group was involved, the author's frustration led to the decision. However, after the incident, the author felt guilty, which suggests they realized the situation's sensitivity. \n\nOn the other hand, Sarah's enjoyment was also a factor. The author acknowledges that she was having fun but couldn't keep up. The group might have other ways to accommodate her, like using calculators, pre-figuring numbers, or taking on more of the math themselves. But the author decided to remove her instead of finding alternative solutions. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the action was justified. The group had legitimate concerns about game time, but handling it by removing Sarah caused emotional harm. Maybe there were other ways to help her without kicking her out. The author's approach might have been too abrupt, not considering all possible accommodations. Therefore, the author could be seen as contributing to the problem by not exploring all options before deciding to remove Sarah. However, the group as a whole was involved in the decision, but the author was the main driver. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person's actions were reasonable. The author's frustration is valid, but the way it was handled led to a negative outcome. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they pushed for removal without exhausting all possible solutions to accommodate Sarah's needs, which could have prevented the emotional fallout.\n"
