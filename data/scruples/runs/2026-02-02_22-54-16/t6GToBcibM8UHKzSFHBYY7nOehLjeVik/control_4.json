Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a D&D group where one member, Sarah, is taking too long to do the math during her turns. The author decided to kick her out because of this, which led to Sarah getting upset and leaving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons. The main issue is Sarah's inability to perform the math quickly, which is slowing down the game for everyone. The author argues that it's not complicated math, just basic addition and subtraction. But Sarah is taking 7-8 minutes per turn, which is way longer than others. The group tried giving her another chance if Adam (her coworker) could help her improve, but that didn't work, and Sarah became frustrated, leading to an emotional breakdown.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, the group's time is limited, and the game isn't fun if each session is cut short due to delays. The author mentions that they lost a lot of game time waiting on Sarah. It's reasonable to want the game to be enjoyable for everyone. But on the other hand, Sarah genuinely enjoyed the game, and the way they handled the situation might have been harsh. The author was the main one pushing to remove her, and even though they gave her a chance through Adam, it didn't help. The result was Sarah crying and leaving, which is a negative outcome.\n\nThe key points here are about empathy and communication. The group might have been too focused on the pace of the game and not enough on Sarah's feelings. Maybe there were alternative solutions they didn't consider, like helping her during the game, using a calculator, or adjusting the game format. The fact that Sarah was having fun despite the struggles shows her positive attitude, but the group's frustration led to a harsh action. The author's primary role in pushing for removal and the resulting emotional harm might mean they're at fault.\n\nHowever, D&D requires participation from all, and if one person's pace is ruining the experience for others, the group has a right to address it. The problem is how they addressed it. Instead of kicking her out, maybe a more supportive approach could have been better. But the author did try to be understanding by giving her a second chance through Adam. The final result was still a breakdown, so maybe the group's approach was too abrupt.\n\nIn conclusion, while the group had valid concerns about game time, the way they handled the situation, especially the author's role in pushing for removal and the lack of more supportive strategies, could make them at fault. The emotional impact on Sarah suggests that the author might be in the wrong.\n"
