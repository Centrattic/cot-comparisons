Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D group where they invited Sarah, who's really slow at doing the math required for the game. The group ended up making her leave because she couldn't keep up, and it led to her crying and being upset. The author is feeling guilty because they were the main one pushing to remove her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a D&D game. It's a group activity where everyone's participation is supposed to be fun. The problem here is that Sarah's pace was causing delays, making the game less enjoyable for others. But the key point is whether the group handled the situation appropriately.\n\nThe author mentions that Sarah's math skills are a problem. But D&D isn't super hard math, right? Maybe she's just not used to it or has some anxiety. The group tried to be patient, gave her a chance, and even let Adam help her at work. But when that didn't work, they decided to remove her. However, this approach seems a bit harsh. Instead of kicking her out, maybe they could have found other solutions. Like using a calculator, pre-calculating some numbers, or assigning someone to help her during the game. The group might have failed to accommodate her needs, which led to her frustration and eventual breakdown.\n\nAlso, the author was the main person pushing for her removal. While they might have good intentions, they should consider the emotional impact on Sarah. The fact that she was upset and cried shows that the way the group handled it was hurtful. The question is whether the author had the right to push for her removal without finding alternative solutions first. \n\nOn the other hand, the group might have a right to expect that everyone can participate in a timely manner. If someone's pace is affecting the whole group's experience, they might need to address it. But the way they addressed it seems too extreme. Maybe they should have talked to Sarah privately, explained the problem, and worked with her to find solutions before deciding to remove her. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They were frustrated, but their approach led to Sarah being hurt. They might not be the sole person responsible, but their role in pushing for her removal without trying other options first does make them partly at fault. The answer might be A (Yes), because they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy and didn't explore other possible solutions.\n"
