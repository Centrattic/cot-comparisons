Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their D&D group because she can't do math quickly. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has six players who meet weekly. Adam invited his coworker Sarah. D&D involves a lot of math, even if it's simple addition. Sarah takes much longer than others\u20147-8 minutes per turn, which is way longer than the 1-2 minutes others take. They tried giving her another chance when Adam suggested she might improve, but she didn't get faster. Eventually, she got frustrated, snapped, and left in tears. Now the author is feeling guilty and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the author is the one who initially pushed to remove Sarah. The group did remove her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The key points here are: the author's frustration, the group's decision, the impact on Sarah, and whether the author is at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the game's structure relies on timely turns for everyone to enjoy the session. If one person is taking excessively long, it affects the whole group's time and enjoyment. The author might argue that it's a practical issue\u2014logistics of the game. They tried to give her another chance through Adam, but that didn't work out.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah genuinely enjoyed the game. The group's action led to her emotional distress, which is serious. The author was the main driver in removing her, which could be seen as insensitive. The way they handled it might have been harsh, especially without a more gradual approach or offering help. Maybe they could have tried more support, like helping her with math during the game or using aids to speed things up. The fact that she cried and left suggests that the group's approach was too abrupt and hurtful.\n\nAlso, the group didn't consider other solutions. Maybe they could have adjusted the game to be less math-intensive for her, or paired her with someone to assist during her turns. Removing her was a drastic step, and the author's primary frustration might have overshadowed empathy for Sarah's feelings.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, community often looks at intent and impact. The intent was to have a functional game, but the impact was severe on Sarah. The author might be seen as the asshole because they prioritized their own enjoyment and game logistics over Sarah's well-being and enjoyment. They didn't explore all possible accommodations before removing her. Even if the math is a game requirement, there might be ways to adapt rather than exclude someone.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). They didn't handle the situation with enough sensitivity, didn't explore alternatives, and their actions led to a negative emotional outcome for Sarah.\n"
