Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the D&D group situation is in the wrong. So the main issue is about a player, Sarah, who takes too long to do math during her turns, causing the game to drag and leading to her emotional breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D does involve a lot of math, but the author mentions it's not difficult\u2014single and double-digit addition. The problem is Sarah's speed; she takes 7-8 minutes per turn, which is way longer than others. The group was concerned about the time, and they wanted to give her another chance by having Adam help her at work. But that didn't work, and the situation got worse.\n\nNow, was the author in the wrong? The author was the main one pushing to remove Sarah. They felt frustrated and wanted the game to move faster. But the way it played out, they ended up hurting Sarah's feelings and causing her to leave upset. The group tried to accommodate her, but it's not working. \n\nI need to think about the social dynamics and responsibility. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe they should have considered alternative solutions first. For example, could they have adjusted how turns are handled? Maybe let Sarah do the math outside the session and just report the results, or use a calculator if needed. Also, the emotional impact on Sarah is significant. Even if the game is about math, it's important to be considerate of others' feelings. The fact that Adam was worried about work awkwardness and the group tried to help her before removing her shows they weren't just being mean. But the author was the one who wanted to kick her out in the first place, which might be harsh. \n\nAnother angle: everyone enjoys the game, but Sarah's pace is affecting the group's experience. However, the method they used to address it might have been too abrupt. The author feeling guilty now suggests that maybe the decision was impulsive. They could have communicated better or offered more support. So, while there's a valid concern about the game's flow, the approach taken could have been more empathetic. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's main mistake was being the primary force behind removing Sarah without exhausting all possible accommodations. The emotional toll on Sarah and the fact that she genuinely enjoyed the game, even if she struggled, means that the author's actions might be seen as uncaring. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
