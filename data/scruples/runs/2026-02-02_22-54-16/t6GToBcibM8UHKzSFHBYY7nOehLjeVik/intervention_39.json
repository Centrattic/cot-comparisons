Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of the D&D group because she can't do math quickly. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group started with 6 people and invited Sarah through Adam. The main issue is that Sarah's turns take way longer than others, causing the game to drag. The group tried to be patient, gave her another chance after Adam tried to help, but it didn't work out. Eventually, Sarah left upset and started crying.\n\nThe author feels guilty because they were the main person pushing to remove Sarah. They wonder if they were in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, considering factors like intent, fairness, and alternatives. The problem seems to be about the pace of the game and group dynamics. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not inherently complex. However, Sarah's speed is affecting everyone's enjoyment. The group tried to accommodate her, but when that didn't work, they decided to remove her. \n\nBut was there a better way? Maybe they could have adjusted the game to be less math-heavy for her, or paired her with someone to help during her turns. The fact that they gave her a second chance but it still didn't improve shows they were trying to be fair. However, the outcome was Sarah being upset and leaving. The author's frustration is understandable, but perhaps they could have handled the communication differently. \n\nOn the other hand, the group collectively decided to remove her after Adam's suggestion didn't work. The author was the main advocate, but the guilt might stem from seeing the emotional impact. The key points are intent (trying to maintain game time) vs. the harm caused (Sarah's emotional distress). \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the group's actions were reasonable. Since they tried to help Sarah improve and it still didn't work, their decision might be seen as necessary for the group's enjoyment. But the way it was handled could have been more sensitive. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just the approach. So the author's actions, while leading to a negative outcome, might not be entirely their fault, but maybe they share some responsibility. \n\nAlternatively, if the group had considered other solutions before removing her, maybe the answer would be different. But given the information, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
