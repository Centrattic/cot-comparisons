Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking way too long to take her turns because she's slow at math. The group wanted to remove her, which led to her crying and leaving. The author was the main person pushing for her removal and now feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not super complex. Sarah was invited by Adam and had been playing for a few months. Initially, they thought she was just learning, but even after that, her turns were taking 7-8 minutes. The group tried giving her another chance with Adam helping her at work, but it didn't work. Sarah ended up getting frustrated and emotional, leading to her leaving.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the group's time is a shared resource, and if one person's slow play is ruining the fun for everyone else, it's understandable they might want to address it. But on the other hand, they didn't handle it very sensitively. They tried to help, but maybe they should have found another solution before resorting to kicking her out. Also, the fact that Sarah was enjoying the game despite her struggles might mean they should have been more accommodating. Maybe they could have suggested tools like calculators or pre-rolling dice to speed things up. Instead, they went straight to removal, which caused emotional harm. The author was the main push for this, so maybe they didn't consider alternatives. The answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they prioritized their own experience over Sarah's feelings without trying enough alternatives. But B could be the case if they can't be expected to accommodate someone who can't meet the game's requirements. Hmm, tricky. I think the key here is that they didn't handle it well, and the author was too forceful without considering other solutions. So A.\n"
