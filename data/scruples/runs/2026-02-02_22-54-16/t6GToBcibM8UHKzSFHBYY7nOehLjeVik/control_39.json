Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this Reddit-style AMA is the asshole (AITA) for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she can't do math quickly. The answer needs to be A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The group has been playing D&D for two years with six people. Adam invited his coworker Sarah, who's been playing for a few months. She's taking way longer than everyone else to do the math during her turns\u2014even with notes. Her turns take 7-8 minutes each, which is causing the game to drag. The group discussed removing her, except Adam who's worried about work relationships. They give her another chance if Adam helps her improve. Adam tries, but it doesn't work. Sarah gets frustrated, snaps, cries, and leaves. Now the author feels guilty and is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author was the main one pushing to remove Sarah. The group's time is limited and they want to enjoy the game. However, Sarah was having fun, even with the slow pace, until they pressured her. The way it ended was emotional and hurtful. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, D&D is a social activity where everyone should enjoy. If Sarah's presence is causing the game to be unenjoyable for the group, maybe they have a point. But the way they handled it seems harsh. They didn't try other solutions first, like helping her more or adjusting the game to accommodate her pace. Instead, they went straight to kicking her out, leading to her emotional breakdown. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but they should have considered Sarah's feelings and looked for alternatives. Maybe they could have paired her with someone to help her during the game, simplified the math, or used pre-calculated charts. The fact that they didn't attempt those solutions and instead let the pressure build up until it exploded makes their approach seem inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the group's decision to remove her led to her leaving the game altogether. Even if the group's time is limited, they should have found a way to include her without making her feel excluded. The author's role in pushing for removal, especially when Sarah was enjoying the game, suggests they prioritized their own enjoyment over hers. That's where the guilt comes in. \n\nSo, while the group had valid concerns about game time, the way they handled it was flawed. The author's primary role in the decision and the negative outcome for Sarah makes them the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
