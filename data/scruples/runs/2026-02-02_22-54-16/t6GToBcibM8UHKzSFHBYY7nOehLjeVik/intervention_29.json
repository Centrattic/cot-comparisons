Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is the one sharing the story) is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she's slow at math. The story says Sarah was invited by Adam, and her slow math was causing delays. The group gave her another chance, but after Adam tried to help and it didn't work, Sarah had a meltdown. Now the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. D&D is a group activity that relies on everyone's participation. If one person's pace is causing the whole group to lose time, that's a valid concern. The group did give Sarah another chance, which shows they tried to be accommodating. But even after that, the problem persisted, leading to frustration and Sarah's emotional breakdown.\n\nThe author was the main push for removing Sarah. While their frustration is understandable, the way the situation unfolded might be the key. They tried to find a solution (Adam's help), but when that failed, they proceeded with removal, which led to negative consequences. The question is whether their actions were justified.\n\nOn one hand, the group's time and enjoyment matter. If the game isn't fun because of delays, it's reasonable to address it. On the other hand, removing someone because they can't handle the math quickly might be seen as harsh, especially if they're having fun and the issue isn't malicious. The fact that Sarah was struggling and then felt pressured could mean the approach was too abrupt or lacked empathy.\n\nThe author's guilt suggests they might have acted out of frustration without considering alternative solutions. Maybe they could have explored other ways to help her, like pre-calculating some numbers or using tools. The emotional impact on Sarah indicates that the group's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, weren't handled sensitively.\n\nSo, while the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to maintain the game's flow, the method they used could be questioned. However, since the group did attempt solutions and the situation led to Sarah's departure, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions were seen as necessary for group dynamics or too harsh on Sarah.\n"
