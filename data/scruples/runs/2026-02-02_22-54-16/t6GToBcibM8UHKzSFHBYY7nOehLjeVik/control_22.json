Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she's slow at math. \n\nFirst, the context: The group plays D&D every week, and Sarah was invited by Adam. She's taking way longer than others. They tried giving her another chance, but she got frustrated and left in tears. The author was the main one pushing to remove her now feels guilty.\n\nSo, what are the factors here? Well, D&D does involve math, but it's not super complex. Sarah had formulas written down, so she's not ignorant of the rules. The problem is her speed. The group is spending a lot of time waiting for her, which affects everyone's enjoyment. They tried to work with her through Adam, but it didn't help. Eventually, she was unhappy and left.\n\nOn one hand, the game is supposed to be fun for everyone. If the pace is too slow, it could be affecting the group's experience. But on the other hand, Sarah was enjoying the game, and the group's approach might have been too harsh. They didn't want to make it awkward, but she ended up feeling pressured and upset. The author was the main advocate for removing her, and that led to negative consequences.\n\nIs it fair to kick someone out because they're not good at math? That's a tricky question. The game requires some math, but if someone's inability to perform quickly disrupts the game, is it the group's right to ask them to leave? Or should they have found a different solution?\n\nAlternative solutions could be using calculators, having someone assist her, or maybe adjusting the game to reduce the math load. But the group didn't try those. They went straight to removing her, which seems harsh. The fact that she was having fun and then was made to feel like she wasn't good enough could mean the group was inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the group's time is also important. They can't have the game drag on for hours because one person is slow. The author was frustrated, but the way they handled it led to Sarah's emotional distress. Maybe they should have communicated better or found a compromise instead of removing her.\n\nIn the end, Sarah stopped coming, and the author feels guilty. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether the action was justified. The problem was the math speed, but the solution caused more harm. The author might not be entirely wrong, but the way they handled the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes) because the author contributed to a toxic situation that hurt Sarah's feelings, even if the intention was to improve the game for everyone.\n"
