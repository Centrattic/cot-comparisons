Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she couldn't do math quickly. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group plays D&D weekly, and Sarah, a coworker, was invited by Adam. She's been there a few months but takes much longer than others for her turns, even with formulas written down. The author thought it was because she was new, but it's been a while. They tried giving her another chance after Adam tried to help, but she still struggled, leading to frustration and her crying.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty, as they were the main one pushing to remove her. Now they're questioning if they're the asshole. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider a few angles. D&D is a group activity that relies on everyone's participation. If one person is causing significant delays, it's affecting everyone's experience. However, they did try to address it by giving her another chance and Adam's intervention. The fact that Sarah was frustrated and ended up upset is a red flag. Maybe they didn't handle it the best way.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, they have a right to enjoy the game too. If the group collectively decides to remove someone who's hindering the experience, even if it's for a reason like this, they might not be in the wrong. However, the way it was handled could be better. Perhaps they should have communicated the issue more sensitively or found another solution, like pre-rolling dice or using a calculator. The fact that Sarah was upset and left in tears suggests that the approach was harsh, even if the intent was to maintain the game's flow.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't the only one at fault. Adam's concern about work relationships and the group's decision-making process also plays a role. The author might feel they were the main driver, but the group collectively made the decision. However, the guilt the author feels indicates they realize the impact of their actions. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider alternative solutions and their frustration led to a harsh outcome, even if the issue was real. But some might argue B because they were within their rights to maintain the group's enjoyment. Hmm. I need to weigh the intent versus the outcome. The outcome was hurtful, so maybe the author is at least partially in the wrong. But the question is whether they are in the wrong overall. Given that they tried to address it initially, but the handling led to Sarah's distress, the answer leans towards A.\n"
