Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking way too long to do the math during her turns. The author, who is part of the group, ended up being the main person pushing to kick Sarah out because she couldn't do the math quickly enough. This led to Sarah getting upset, crying, and leaving, which made the author feel guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's not super complex. The problem was that Sarah was taking much longer than others, which was slowing down the entire game. The group tried giving her another chance after Adam tried helping her at work, but it didn't help, and Sarah became frustrated and eventually had an emotional breakdown.\n\nNow, the key points here. Did the author act inconsiderately? They initiated the idea of removing Sarah, which led to a very negative outcome. However, they were concerned about the game's pace and the other players' enjoyment. But on the other hand, the way they handled it might have been harsh. They gave Sarah a chance when Adam suggested it, but even after that, they proceeded with removing her. However, the actual kickout led to Sarah being upset. So the question is whether the author's actions were justified or if they were insensitive.\n\nAnother angle is that the group wanted to be considerate, but the author's frustration led to a decision that hurt Sarah. Maybe there were other solutions they could have tried first, like helping her more during the game, using apps or tools to speed up calculations, or adjusting the game style to reduce the math burden. The author might have assumed that Sarah couldn't improve and didn't explore enough alternatives before deciding to remove her. Also, the emotional impact on Sarah suggests that the approach taken was not the best way to handle the situation.\n\nHowever, the group did try to accommodate her by giving her another chance, and Adam was the one who tried to help. The author might feel they were acting in the group's best interest for the game to be enjoyable for everyone. But when Sarah started showing signs of frustration and stress, the group should have realized that their approach wasn't working and maybe stopped the game earlier to talk about it instead of letting it escalate.\n\nIn the end, the author's primary role in pushing for Sarah's removal and the resulting emotional harm to her points towards them being at fault. Even if the intention was to keep the game running smoothly, the method used wasn't considerate enough of Sarah's feelings and capabilities. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any other perspectives. Maybe the group had a right to expect a certain pace, but the way they handled it was poor. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not considering other solutions and being too hasty.\n"
