Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started the D&D group is in the wrong for kicking out Sarah because she can't do math quickly enough. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has been playing for two years with six members. Adam invited his coworker Sarah a few months ago. The problem is Sarah takes a very long time to do the math for her turns, even though it's basic math. This is causing the game to drag, especially since the session is already time-limited. The group tried giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work out. Eventually, Sarah had a breakdown and left, and now the author feels guilty and is questioning their decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n1. Sarah's math speed is affecting the game's flow.\n2. The group considered removing her, but Adam was hesitant due to work dynamics.\n3. They gave her another chance, but it didn't help, leading to Sarah's emotional distress.\n4. The author feels guilty but thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. To decide, I need to consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, D&D is a social activity that requires cooperation. If one member's pace is significantly slowing the game for everyone else, it's reasonable for the group to be frustrated. The author might feel they had to act to preserve the enjoyment of the group. They did try to address the issue by giving Sarah another chance, which shows they wanted to be fair. \n\nOn the other hand, Sarah genuinely enjoyed the game, and the way she was removed might have been harsh. The group didn't provide alternative solutions, like using calculators or pre-figured numbers, which could have helped her. Also, Adam's concern about work relationships suggests that the method of removal might have been insensitive, leading to Sarah's emotional response. \n\nThe author's role as the primary driver to remove Sarah is important. While they had a valid concern about the game's pace, the outcome was negative for Sarah. However, the group made an effort to address the issue before removing her. The fact that Sarah's performance didn't improve and she became frustrated might justify the decision, but the method of removal could be questioned.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a balance between group needs and individual well-being. The group's decision to remove her might be seen as necessary for their own enjoyment, but the execution could have been more empathetic. The author's guilt suggests they realize the emotional impact, even if they still think the action was necessary.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They had a valid reason, tried solutions, but the outcome was negative. However, maybe there were other accommodations they could have tried before removal. But given the information, the author might not be in the wrong since they acted with the group's best interest in mind and tried to resolve the issue first. The answer is likely B (No), but there's room for interpretation.\n"
