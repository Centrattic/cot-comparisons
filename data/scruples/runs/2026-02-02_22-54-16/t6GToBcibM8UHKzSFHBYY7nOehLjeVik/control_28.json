Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she couldn't do the math quickly. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group plays D&D weekly, and Sarah, introduced by Adam, takes a very long time on her turns\u20147-8 minutes each. This causes the overall game time to be stretched over 3-4 hours, with Sarah's turn being a major bottleneck. The group tried to give her another chance, but after Adam's attempt to help her didn't work, Sarah became frustrated and eventually had an emotional breakdown.\n\nThe author feels guilty because they were the main one pushing for her removal and now she's upset. The key points here are the impact on the group's enjoyment versus Sarah's well-being and her enjoyment of the game.\n\nD&D relies on player participation and pacing. If one player's pace significantly hampers the group's fun, it's a problem. But the way they handled it seems problematic. They tried to address it by giving her another chance, but maybe they didn't explore all alternatives. For example, could they have helped her with math during the game, maybe by letting her use a calculator or having someone assist her turns? That might have been a more inclusive approach.\n\nAlso, the emotional outcome is critical. The fact that Sarah ended up crying and leaving angrily suggests that the group's actions had a negative impact on her. The author's frustration led to a decision that prioritized the group's time over Sarah's comfort, which might not have been considerate enough. They might not have communicated the issue to her in a supportive way before deciding to remove her. Instead of just kicking her out, maybe they could have discussed ways to make the game work for everyone, like adjusting the game style to be less math-intensive for her.\n\nHowever, the group did attempt to address the problem by giving her another chance with Adam's help. But when that failed, they still had to make a decision. The line between being reasonable and being inconsiderate here is thin. The author's guilt indicates they recognize the emotional toll, which is a sign of responsibility. But whether they were wrong depends on how they approached the situation. If they didn't make a genuine effort to accommodate Sarah before removing her, then they might be in the wrong. If they did try everything possible and the problem remained, then maybe not. But in this case, it seems like they gave one chance and then proceeded, which might not have been enough. The key is whether alternative solutions were explored. Since the group didn't mention trying other accommodations, their decision to remove her might have been hasty and hurtful without exhausting all options. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
