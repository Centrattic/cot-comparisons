Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of the D&D group because she can't do math quickly enough. The author feels guilty after Sarah broke down and left in tears.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether it's fair to remove someone from a social group for a skill they lack, even if it's something as basic as mental math. The author and the group tried to be understanding initially, giving Sarah a chance to improve with Adam's help. But that didn't work, and Sarah ended up upset.\n\nI should think about the context. D&D is a social game that relies on everyone's participation. If one person's slow pace is making the game unenjoyable for others, there's a conflict between individual needs and group dynamics. The author was the one pushing for removal, but they're now feeling guilty. \n\nIs the problem about the math or the group's inability to accommodate? Maybe there were alternative solutions, like letting Sarah take notes or using calculators. But the group might not have considered those. They gave Adam a chance to help, which didn't work. \n\nSarah's emotional response is a big factor. The group's actions led to her distress. Even if the author's intention was to maintain the game's flow, the outcome was harmful. The question is whether the means justified the ends. \n\nThe author's guilt suggests they recognized the harm. But were they wrong to prioritize the group's experience over Sarah's? It's a classic dilemma between collective enjoyment and individual inclusion. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the impact on others. Even if the group felt they had a right to remove Sarah, the way it happened (leading to tears) might make them responsible. The author's role in initiating the removal could be seen as contributing to the negative outcome. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They might not be the sole villain, but their actions played a part in Sarah's distress. The answer could depend on whether there were other options and how the group handled the situation. If they were too quick to remove her without more support, that's a problem. But if the math was a legitimate issue affecting everyone, maybe they had a point. \n\nI think the answer is more nuanced. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they share some responsibility for not finding a better solution before removing Sarah. The situation shows a failure to accommodate, but the outcome is a clear negative. So, maybe the answer is A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't consider enough alternatives and their actions caused harm, even if the intention was to maintain the game's flow.\n"
