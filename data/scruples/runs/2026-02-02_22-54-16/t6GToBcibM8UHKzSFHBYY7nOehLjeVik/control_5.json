Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking a really long time to do the math during her turns. The author, who's part of the group, wanted her to leave because of this, and eventually the group decided to remove her after giving her another chance with Adam's help, but that didn't work. The result was Sarah getting upset and leaving, and the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. D&D does involve a lot of math, but it's supposed to be a fun, social activity. The main issue here is the time Sarah takes, which is affecting the group's enjoyment because sessions are long but not productive. However, the group tried to accommodate her by giving her another chance with Adam's help. Even though they tried to help, it didn't work out, leading to Sarah's emotional response.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty because they were the main one pushing for Sarah's removal. The question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, the group's time is important, and if one person is slowing things down so much that others can't enjoy the game, it's a valid concern. On the other hand, the way they handled it might have been harsh. The group didn't communicate the problem to Sarah directly or try to find alternative solutions, like using calculators or pre-rolling dice. Instead, they opted for removing her after a failed attempt to make her faster. That approach might have been abrasive and could have led to Sarah feeling embarrassed or pressured.\n\nAlso, Adam's concern about work dynamics suggests that the group might not have handled the situation with enough sensitivity. Sarah was having fun despite the struggle, so the group's decision to remove her might have prioritized their own enjoyment over her feelings. The outcome where Sarah breaks down in tears indicates that the approach was hurtful, even if the intention was to improve the game experience for everyone.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but the method they used to address the issue\u2014removing Sarah without maybe trying more supportive measures first\u2014might be where they went wrong. It's possible that they could have found other ways to help Sarah, like assigning someone to assist her during the game or adjusting the game's pacing. Instead, they opted for exclusion, which had negative emotional consequences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with enough empathy and communication. They prioritized their own frustration over Sarah's feelings and didn't explore all possible solutions before deciding to remove her. The emotional impact on Sarah suggests that the group's approach was too harsh, even if the problem of slow turns was valid.\n"
