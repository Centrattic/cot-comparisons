Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is taking too long to do the math required for the game. The group eventually kicks her out, and she ends up crying. The author feels guilty but thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, D&D does involve some math, and if Sarah's pace is slowing down the game for everyone, the group might feel it's affecting their enjoyment. They tried giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work. The group's time is limited, and they want to have fun without waiting too long each turn.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was the main push to remove Sarah. Even if the math is basic, forcing someone out because they can't perform quickly could be seen as harsh. The fact that Sarah was having fun and became frustrated shows that the group's actions impacted her emotionally. The author might not have considered alternative solutions before deciding to kick her out. Maybe they could have adjusted the game style, like using calculators or pre-rolling dice to help her speed up. Also, the way Adam handled the situation at work led to Sarah being more stressed, which might not have been the best approach.\n\nThe key points are whether the group gave her all possible support and if there were other options before removal. They did try helping her, but maybe not enough. However, the author being the most frustrated and pushing for removal could make them responsible. The emotional impact on Sarah suggests that the group's approach was too abrupt. So, while the group's intention was to improve the game experience for everyone, the method used might have been too harsh, making the author partially wrong. Answer A.\n"
