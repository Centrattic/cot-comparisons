Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking too long to do math during her turns, causing delays and frustration. The author, who is part of the group, wanted to kick Sarah out because of her slow math skills, leading to her breaking down in tears and leaving the group. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author and the group had legitimate concerns about the game's pace. D&D is a time-intensive game, and if one player's slow pace is causing the entire session to drag, it affects everyone's enjoyment. The author tried to address it by giving Sarah another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work out. They might feel they had no choice to maintain the game's flow.\n\nOn the other hand, excluding someone from a social group can have emotional consequences. Sarah seemed to genuinely enjoy the game, and the way she was treated might have made her feel devalued. The author's frustration might have overshadowed her feelings, leading to her emotional breakdown. The group's approach could have been more empathetic, maybe finding alternative solutions like allowing her to use a calculator or spreading out her turns more.\n\nThe key points are the impact on group dynamics versus individual enjoyment and the approach taken to resolve the issue. While the author had valid reasons, the method of exclusion without sufficient alternatives might be considered harsh. It's a balance between group needs and individual circumstances. If the author acted without considering other solutions or being more supportive, they might be partially at fault. However, if they had explored all options and the group's frustration was too high, it's more complex.\n\nI need to decide if the author's actions were justified. The answer hinges on whether they handled the situation appropriately. The fact that they gave Sarah multiple chances but ultimately decided to remove her, leading to her emotional distress, suggests that maybe they could have done more to accommodate her. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because the exclusion caused harm and perhaps wasn't the most compassionate approach. But if the group had no other choice, then B (not in the wrong). Hmm. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is A because the way they handled it wasn't considerate enough.\n"
