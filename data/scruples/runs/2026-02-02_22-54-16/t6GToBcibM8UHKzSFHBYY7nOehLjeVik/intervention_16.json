Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking a long time to do math, which is slowing down the game. The author wanted to kick her out, but now feels guilty because Sarah ended up crying and leaving. \n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that the game's pace is important for everyone's enjoyment. In D&D, turns can be a big part of the game, and if one person is causing significant delays, it affects the whole group. The author and the group tried to be accommodating by giving Sarah another chance, but when that didn't work, they decided to remove her. The key here is whether their decision to remove her was justified.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah seemed to be having fun even though she was slow. The author acknowledges that she was genuinely enjoying the game, but the problem was the impact on the group's time. The fact that she became frustrated and ended up emotional suggests that the situation was stressful for her. The author also admits to being the primary person pushing for her removal and now feels guilty.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong in their approach. Did they handle it poorly? Maybe there were other solutions they could have tried before removing her. For example, maybe using apps or tools to help with the math, or having the DM handle some calculations for her. But the group did try to help through Adam, and that didn't work. \n\nAlso, social dynamics are important. The author might have been more considerate in how they approached the issue, perhaps discussing it more privately or finding alternative solutions. The fact that Sarah ended up crying indicates that the way they handled it might have been harsh. However, the group's decision to remove her was to maintain the game's pace, which is a valid concern for the other players.\n\nThe author's guilt suggests they might feel they didn't consider Sarah's feelings enough. However, the responsibility isn't entirely on them; it's a group decision. Still, the outcome was negative for Sarah. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They had a legitimate issue, but the method of resolving it might have been lacking in sensitivity. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because the author was a driving force and the action led to a negative outcome for Sarah, even if it was for a valid reason. However, some might argue it's not their fault if they tried alternatives. Hmm.\n"
