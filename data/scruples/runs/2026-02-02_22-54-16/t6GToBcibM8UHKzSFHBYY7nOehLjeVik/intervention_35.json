Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she couldn't do math quickly enough. The author claims they wanted to remove her because her slow pace was making the game sessions too long, but after she broke down crying, they feel guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D does involve a lot of math, and while it's not complex, speed can affect the flow of the game. The group mentions they meet weekly for 3-4 hours, and Sarah's turns take 7-8 minutes each, which is significantly longer than others. The group tried giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work, leading to Sarah's emotional breakdown.\n\nThe key points here are intent and actions. The author wanted to maintain the group's enjoyment and game efficiency, which is understandable. However, the way they handled it might be problematic. They decided to remove Sarah after she was already struggling, leading to her emotional distress. The group might not have considered other accommodations, like pre-calculating numbers or using tools to help her speed up. Also, the fact that Adam was uncomfortable with the removal because of work dynamics shows that the group didn't handle the communication well.\n\nOn the other hand, the group did try to address the issue before removing her, giving her time to improve with Adam's assistance. But that didn't resolve the problem. The main issue is whether the group's actions were reasonable. They had a legitimate concern about game time, but the consequence was severe for Sarah. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because group dynamics and shared interests matter, but they could have been more empathetic and explored other solutions before resorting to removal.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had valid concerns, the outcome suggests that there might have been a lack of alternative solutions considered. The emotional impact on Sarah is significant, so there's a case to say the group, including the author, could have handled it better. However, since they did attempt to help and the others agreed, it's a bit of a grey area. But maybe the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the intention was to maintain the group's game experience, though the execution had flaws.\n"
