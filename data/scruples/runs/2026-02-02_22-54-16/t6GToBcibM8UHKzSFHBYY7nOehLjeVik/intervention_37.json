Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is part of a D&D group that's been playing for two years with six people. They mention that one player, Adam, invited his coworker, Sarah, to join. D&D involves a lot of math, mostly simple addition and subtraction. Sarah has been playing for a few months, and her turns take way longer than others\u2014up to 7-8 minutes each time, with some calculations taking a minute just for three single-digit numbers. Initially, they thought she was learning, but even after having formulas written down, she's still slow. Adam says she's known for being slow at work too.\n\nThe group discussed removing her because the game time is getting eaten up by her slow turns. Adam was the only one against it, worried about work awkwardness. They gave her another chance if Adam could help her speed up. Adam tried during lunch but it didn't work. Sarah got frustrated and eventually snapped at them, leading to her crying and leaving. The author feels guilty now and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the group's enjoyment vs. Sarah's enjoyment, the math ability as a barrier, and the handling of the situation. The author was the main person pushing to remove her. \n\nFirst, D&D requires some mental math. If Sarah is unable to keep up, maybe it's a problem. But on the other hand, the group is supposed to be fun for everyone. The problem is that her slow turns are making the game less enjoyable for others. But they did try to give her a chance with Adam's help, which didn't work. The outcome was Sarah getting upset and leaving. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe they didn't consider alternatives. Did they try to help her more, like giving her tools or maybe using a calculator? If they just decided to remove her instead of adjusting the game to accommodate her, that could be a problem. Also, the way they handled the removal might have been harsh. They gave her a chance, but when she got frustrated, the group might have reacted negatively, leading to her breakdown. \n\nBut Sarah's math ability isn't something she can change easily. Maybe the group should have adjusted their expectations. However, the author was trying to protect the group's enjoyment. There's a balance between being inclusive and maintaining the game's flow. The author might have been too focused on the group's time and not enough on Sarah's feelings. Alternatively, perhaps the group should have found another way to help her, like using a calculator or having someone assist her with the math. \n\nIn the end, Sarah left and was upset. The author feels guilty. So maybe the answer depends on whether they had other options before removing her. If they tried all possible accommodations and it still didn't work, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they didn't try enough alternatives, then they might be. The story says they gave her another chance with Adam's help, but Adam couldn't make her faster. However, maybe they could have used other strategies, like pre-rolling dice or simplifying the math. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because the problem was a legitimate issue affecting the group's enjoyment. However, they could have been more proactive in finding solutions. But since they did try to give her another chance and it still failed, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). Alternatively, if the math is a core part of the game and she can't perform it, maybe it's unavoidable. But maybe the author should have handled it more sensitively. I'm a bit torn here. The answer probably leans towards B, but with the note that they could have handled it better.\n"
