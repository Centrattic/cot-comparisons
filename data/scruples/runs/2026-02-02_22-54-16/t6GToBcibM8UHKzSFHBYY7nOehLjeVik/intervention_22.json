Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group kicking out a player, Sarah, because she's too slow at doing the math during the game. The writer is feeling guilty but initially pushed for her removal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, D&D involves a lot of math, and if Sarah is taking 7-8 minutes per turn, that's a major disruption. The group's time is limited, and everyone else is getting only 1-2 minutes per turn, so the game isn't enjoyable for them. They tried giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work out, leading to Sarah crying and leaving. The writer admits they were the main person pushing for her removal and now feel guilty.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah was having fun before, and the group's decision to kick her out might have been harsh. They didn't consider alternatives, like using calculators or apps to speed things up. Also, Sarah's emotional response after the pressure was applied by Adam shows that their approach might have been insensitive. The group might have failed to accommodate her differently instead of just removing her.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and alternatives. Did the writer act with malice, or were they trying to preserve the group's enjoyment? They did give her a chance with Adam's help, but when that failed, they had to make a decision. However, maybe there were other solutions they didn't explore first. Also, the fact that Sarah was left feeling hurt and upset suggests that the method of removal wasn't handled well. The writer's frustration is understandable, but their approach might have lacked empathy.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the group as a whole made the decision, but the writer was a primary driver. However, the situation shows a lack of trying alternative solutions before resorting to removal. The answer might depend on whether kicking her out was the only option or if they could have made accommodations. Since they didn't mention trying other methods like using tools or adjusting the game's pace, it's possible they rushed into the decision without considering her feelings and limitations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't explore other options first and the way they handled it led to Sarah's emotional distress. However, they did try to give her a chance. It's a bit of a balance between group dynamics and individual needs.\n"
