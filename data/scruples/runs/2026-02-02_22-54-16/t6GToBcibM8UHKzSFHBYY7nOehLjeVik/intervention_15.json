Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is part of a D&D group that's been meeting for two years. They had a new member, Sarah, introduced by a coworker Adam. The problem is that Sarah takes way longer than everyone else to do the math required during her turns. Even though she has the formulas written down, adding a few numbers takes her minutes, causing the game to be delayed a lot. The group gave her a chance to improve with Adam's help, but that didn't work. Sarah ended up frustrated, snapped at people, and left in tears. Now the author is feeling guilty and asking if they're an asshole for wanting to kick her out.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, D&D does involve a lot of math, and if someone is significantly slowing down the game, it could affect everyone's enjoyment. The group tried to help her improve, but it didn't work. The author was the main one pushing for her removal, but the outcome was negative for Sarah. Maybe they should have found a different solution?\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have considered alternatives. For example, maybe they could have used pre-calculated sheets or apps to help Sarah with the math faster. Did they try any accommodations? The problem was her speed, not her intention. Kicking her out led to emotional distress, which is serious. The author's frustration with the game time is understandable, but the way they handled it might be where they went wrong.\n\nAlso, Adam's concern about work relationships is valid. The group's decision might have caused workplace tension. The author's primary role in wanting to remove her could mean they didn't consider the emotional impact enough. Maybe they should have communicated more with Sarah first instead of giving up after Adam's failed attempt.\n\nBut then, is it the author's fault? They were trying to improve the group's experience. But the method might have been harsh. The key is whether there were other solutions they could have tried before removal. If they didn't explore those, they might share some responsibility. Also, the fact that Sarah was having fun initially but then became stressed shows that the group's approach might have been too abrupt.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to protect the group's time, but the execution led to hurting Sarah. It's a tough balance. Maybe they are partially at fault for not trying other solutions first. Alternatively, if the group's time was being severely impacted, they have a point. But the outcome was emotional harm, which is a strong negative. The answer might hinge on whether alternatives were considered. If the author didn't consider other options, then they might be in the wrong. If they did, maybe not. But the story doesn't mention trying other methods, so maybe A is the answer.\n"
