Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of the D&D group because she couldn't do math quickly. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The group has been playing D&D for two years, six players. Adam invited his coworker Sarah, who's been playing for a few months. She's taking a really long time on her turns\u2014like 7-8 minutes each, because she's slow at adding numbers. The author and the group were frustrated because the game time was getting eaten up by her long turns, making the whole session only about 90 minutes of actual gameplay in a 3-4 hour session. They tried giving her another chance if Adam helped her improve, but that didn't work. Then Sarah got frustrated, snapped, cried, and left, and now she's not coming back. The author feels guilty and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the reasons for removing Sarah. The author's main argument is that the game relies on math that's not too hard, but Sarah's slowness is affecting the group's enjoyment. However, Sarah seems to be genuinely having fun, even if she's slow. Then, when they tried to address it by having Adam help her, it backfired, making her more stressed and ultimately leading to her breakdown.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author and the group had a legitimate problem\u2014game time efficiency. If one person's pace is causing issues for the whole group, maybe they need to find a solution. But on the other hand, Sarah's enjoyment and emotional well-being are important. The group could have tried alternative solutions before removing her. For example, maybe using a calculator, pre-rolling dice, or having someone assist her without making it obvious. The fact that they gave her another chance but still ended up making her uncomfortable might indicate that the approach was harsh.\n\nAlso, the author was the primary driver in wanting her out and felt the most frustration. After the incident, they feel guilty. The question is whether the action of removing her was justified. The problem was that they didn't try other accommodations first, and instead of addressing the root issue (math speed), they focused on excluding her, which led to a negative outcome. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they prioritized their own enjoyment over Sarah's inclusion and didn't explore other options. Alternatively, maybe they have a right to expect the game to run smoothly.\n\nAnother angle: D&D is a collaborative game, and all players should contribute to making it fun. If one person's inability to keep up is harming the group experience, it's a problem. But there are ways to adapt the game. The group might have failed to be understanding or flexible. The author might not be the asshole if the situation was untenable, but perhaps they handled it poorly. However, the fact that Sarah was enjoying the game and the removal led to her emotional distress complicates things.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they didn't explore alternative solutions, prioritized their own frustration over Sarah's feelings, and the outcome was harmful to her. So, the answer would be A.\n"
