Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is taking a long time to do the math during her turns. The group ends up kicking her out, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The group met weekly for two years, six players. Adam invited Sarah, his coworker. Sarah's turns are taking 7-8 minutes, which is way longer than others. They tried giving her another chance with Adam helping her at work, but it didn't work. Then Sarah got frustrated, snapped, and cried, leading to her leaving the group. The author was the main one pushing to remove her and now feels guilty.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. D&D does involve math, but it's not super complex. The problem here is the time it takes Sarah to do her turns, causing the game to drag. The group tried to accommodate by giving her more time and having Adam help. However, after that, Sarah's experience worsened, leading to her emotional breakdown.\n\nOn one hand, the group had a right to have a smooth game where everyone enjoys. If one person's pace is holding everyone else back, it's a legitimate group dynamic issue. On the other hand, the way they handled it might have been harsh. They tried to help but maybe didn't consider other alternatives, like using a calculator or a phone app to speed up calculations. Also, the fact that Sarah was having fun despite the struggles and then ended up upset suggests that forcing her to leave might have been too abrupt.\n\nThe author was the main one pushing for her removal. Acknowledging their frustration is valid, but the outcome was negative for Sarah. The group could have explored more accommodations first. Also, the method of removal\u2014publicly deciding in a group chat and then cutting the session off after the meltdown\u2014might have been insensitive. Sarah's emotional response indicates that the approach was hurtful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the group as a whole shares some blame, but since the author was the driving force, they might bear more of the guilt. However, the situation is complex. It's possible the author isn't the asshole, but maybe the group could have handled it better. The key point is whether they were aware of the impact of their actions. The author now feels guilty, showing self-awareness.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the group's right to enjoy their game vs. Sarah's right to participate and have fun. The group tried to help but didn't explore all options. The way they handled the removal was harsh. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering alternatives and for being the main push for removal without a softer approach. Alternatively, maybe not, since the group's time is important.\n\nI think the right answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't try all possible solutions and the method of removal was too harsh, leading to Sarah's emotional distress. The group could have found a compromise, like using tools to assist with math, or adjusting the game structure. Instead, they opted for removal, which hurt Sarah.\n"
