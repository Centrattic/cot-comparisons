Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story about their D&D group kicking out Sarah is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The group meets weekly for D&D. Adam invited his coworker Sarah, who's new and takes a long time to do the math, even though she has formulas written down. Her turns are 7-8 minutes, which is way longer than others' 1-2 minutes. They give her another chance after Adam tries to help, but she gets frustrated and ends up crying, then stops playing. The author is the main one pushing to remove her and now feels guilty. They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's consider D&D group dynamics. D&D relies on everyone contributing to the game's flow. If one person is significantly slowing things down, it can disrupt the fun for others. The math isn't hard, but if Sarah is struggling with it, maybe she's not the best fit for the group. They tried to accommodate her by giving her another chance, and when that didn't work, they made a decision. However, the way it happened might have been harsh. She was put under pressure, got frustrated, and ended up in tears. That's not ideal.\n\nBut in a group setting, especially with limited time, it's reasonable to address issues that affect the overall experience. The author's frustration isn't unreasonable given the time lost. The problem is how they handled it. They should have perhaps communicated more, maybe offered to help her practice or use tools to speed things up. Kicking her out might have been a last resort, but the method could have been more considerate. However, the group did try to help, and after that, Sarah's behavior changed, leading to a breakdown. The author might be in the wrong for not being more patient or supportive, but the group's decision to remove her might be justified if it's affecting the game's flow. Alternatively, maybe they should have found a different solution, like allowing her to have a helper or using pre-calculated sheets. The key points are whether the group made a reasonable effort to help her first and if the removal was handled with sensitivity. The story says they tried once, but perhaps that wasn't enough. But given that she didn't improve and was causing frustration, they might have a point. The guilt the author feels suggests they recognize the emotional impact, which is important. \n\nOn the other hand, D&D is a game that can be adapted. Maybe the group could have adjusted the way they handle turns, like using a calculator or allowing more time for new players. The fact that she was having fun initially might mean that the group should have found a way to make the game more accessible to her. But the author's primary role in pushing for her removal and the resulting emotional distress could tip the scales towards them being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether they gave sufficient support and handled the situation with empathy. Since Adam tried once but perhaps not enough, and the group didn't want to make things awkward at work, but Sarah's slowness was still a problem, it's a tough call. However, the author's frustration is understandable. The problem is in the approach rather than the decision itself. But since they ended up causing her to leave in tears, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more understanding and finding alternative solutions. Alternatively, the group had a legitimate reason, but the way they executed it was poor. \n\nI think the key here is that the group made an effort to help, but maybe not the right one. Mental math can be a barrier, and if the group isn't willing to adapt (like using tools or calculators), it's not their fault. But in this case, they didn't try enough alternative methods. However, the story mentions that Sarah was still slow even after being given formulas. So the group might have a valid reason. But causing emotional distress is a red flag. The author is the one who was most frustrated and pushed for removal, leading to a harsh outcome. So maybe they are in the wrong for not handling it more compassionately. But I'm not sure. The group has the right to set expectations for their hobby time, but they should have done it in a way that's respectful and supportive. \n\nHmm. The answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they contributed to a hostile environment despite Sarah's genuine enjoyment. But maybe B if the group's needs are legitimate. It's a bit of a gray area. The decision to remove her might be justified, but the approach was not. The author's guilt suggests they know this. So maybe A is the right choice.\n"
