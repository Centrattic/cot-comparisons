Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking an excessively long time to take her turns due to math difficulties. The main character, the author, suggested removing Sarah, which led to her emotional breakdown and leaving the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. D&D involves a lot of math, which Sarah struggles with, causing delays. The group gave her a chance, even allowing Adam to help her at work, but it didn't work. Eventually, the group removed her, leading to a negative outcome for Sarah. The author feels guilty, but they want to know if they were in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the math in D&D is part of the game. If someone can't perform it efficiently, it can disrupt the game's flow for everyone. However, the group tried to accommodate her by giving her extra help. But even after that, the problem persisted. The author's frustration is understandable because the sessions were taking too long, and the other players were not enjoying the game. \n\nOn the other hand, removing a player could be seen as harsh, especially if they were having fun and the issue was their own skill level. The fact that Sarah ended up crying and leaving suggests that the action had a negative impact on her. The author was the main person pushing for her removal, which might mean they didn't consider other solutions or accommodations enough. \n\nBut the group did make an effort to help her, and maybe there were no other options left. However, maybe they could have adjusted the game to reduce the math burden on Sarah, like pre-rolling stats or using a calculator. The fact that they didn't consider these alternatives might make the author in the wrong. Also, the way they handled the situation led to Sarah's emotional distress, which is a significant factor. \n\nThe author's guilt is a sign that they realize the potential harm caused. But according to the AITA standards, if the problem was a genuine issue affecting the group's enjoyment and they tried to resolve it before removing her, then it might not be their fault. However, the method of removal and not exploring other solutions could make them the asshole. \n\nI think it's a balance between the right to enjoy the game and being inclusive. The group did try to help, but maybe the approach was too abrupt. So the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider all alternatives and their actions led to a negative outcome for Sarah, even if the issue existed.\n"
