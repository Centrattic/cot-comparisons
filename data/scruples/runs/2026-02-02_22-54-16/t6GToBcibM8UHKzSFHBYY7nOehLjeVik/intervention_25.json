Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is struggling with the math required for the game. The author, who's part of the group, was the main person pushing to remove Sarah because her slow pace was affecting everyone else's enjoyment. After some attempts to help her improve, things escalated, leading to Sarah getting upset and leaving the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the group spends time together weekly, and the game's enjoyment is about everyone participating. If one person's pace is causing others to lose out on game time, that's a valid concern. The author might feel that the group's overall experience is being compromised. They tried giving Sarah another chance after Adam's suggestion, but it didn't work out. The frustration here is understandable, especially if the sessions are time-limited.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah genuinely enjoyed the game. Her struggles with math might not be her fault\u2014maybe she has learning difficulties or anxiety that weren't considered. The approach taken by the group could have been too abrupt. They tried to help once, but perhaps they didn't explore enough alternatives. Making her feel pressured could have contributed to her emotional response. The fact that she ended up crying and leaving might suggest that the group's handling was harsh, even if their intention was to maintain the game's flow.\n\nI need to evaluate if there were other ways to handle the situation. Maybe more patience, providing tools like calculators or apps to help with math, or having someone assist her during the game. The group could have discussed this with her privately before deciding to remove her, ensuring she felt supported rather than criticized. The public nature of the removal and the pressure from Adam's workplace context might have added to the stress.\n\nThe author's role as the primary advocate for removing Sarah makes them a key figure here. While their frustration is valid, the outcome was negative for Sarah. The question is whether their actions were justified. If the group made an effort to find solutions before resorting to removal, maybe they're in the right. But if they didn't give enough support and alternatives, they might be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Sarah is significant. Even if the group's intention was to maintain game time, the way it was handled caused her distress. That could mean the author is partially responsible for the outcome, even if the initial problem was about game efficiency. The guilt the author feels now suggests they recognize this, which is a point against them.\n\nIn summary, while the author had valid concerns about game flow, the method of addressing them might have been too harsh. There's a balance between group dynamics and individual needs that wasn't properly maintained. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not adequately supporting Sarah before taking such a drastic step.\n"
