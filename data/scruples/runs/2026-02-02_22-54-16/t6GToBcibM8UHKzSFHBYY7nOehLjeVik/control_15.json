Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where a player, Sarah, is taking too long to do math during her turns. The author was pushing to kick her out because of this, which led to Sarah crying and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The group has been playing for two years, and Sarah joined through Adam's invitation. The main issue is Sarah's slow pace in doing the math, which is affecting the game's flow. The author mentions that even with cheat sheets, she takes 7-8 minutes per turn. They gave her another chance after Adam tried to help, but it didn't work. Eventually, Sarah had a breakdown and left.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the group's time is limited, and the game isn't fun if one person is causing delays. The author was the main advocate for removing her, which led to negative consequences. On the other hand, they did try to give her another chance, and Sarah's mental math speed isn't something she can easily change. The author might have prioritized the group's enjoyment over Sarah's participation, but the outcome was hurtful.\n\nI should think about possible solutions they could have tried before removing her. Maybe using a calculator, having someone help her during the game, or adjusting the game's complexity. However, the group might not want to accommodate her, especially if it affects everyone else's time. Also, the social aspect is important\u2014kicking her out might have been harsh, but if the game is unmanageable, maybe it's necessary.\n\nThe author's guilt suggests they feel they made a mistake. The fact that Sarah was genuinely having fun despite the struggles adds another layer. The group might have failed to consider alternative solutions and instead went for the easiest fix, which hurt her. So, the answer depends on whether the group handled the situation poorly and whether there were better alternatives. If the author didn't give enough alternatives before removing her, they might be in the wrong. But if the situation was untenable, maybe not. However, since they did try once (Adam's help) and failed, perhaps there were other steps they could have taken. The emotional impact on Sarah indicates the approach was harsh. So, I lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
