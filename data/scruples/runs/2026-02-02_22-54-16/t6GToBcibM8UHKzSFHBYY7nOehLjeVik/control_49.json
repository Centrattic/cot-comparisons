Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the D&D group situation is in the wrong. The question is whether they should have kicked Sarah out because she was slow at math during the game.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has six players, and Sarah was invited by Adam. The issue is that Sarah's turns take way longer than others, even with formulas written down. This is causing the game to be slow, and the group is frustrated. They tried giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work, leading to Sarah getting upset and leaving.\n\nThe author was the main person pushing to remove her, and now feels guilty. The key points are whether the author is wrong for doing that. \n\nOn one hand, the group's time is limited, and the game isn't fun if it's taking too long. Everyone except Adam wanted to remove her, and they did give her another chance which didn't help. But the result was Sarah crying and being upset, which is a big negative outcome. The author's frustration might be justified, but the way it was handled led to hurting Sarah's feelings and making her leave. \n\nOn the other hand, the group had made a plan to help her, and when that failed, they ended up in a worse situation. The author's role in being the primary driver for removal and the resulting emotional impact on Sarah might mean they are at fault. It's possible that the group could have found alternative solutions, like helping her more during the sessions or adjusting the game to accommodate her pace, rather than removing her. \n\nBut D&D does require a certain level of participation, and if someone's pace is ruining the experience for others, there might be a legitimate reason to ask them to leave. However, the fact that Sarah was genuinely having fun and the group's actions led to her emotional distress complicates things. The author's guilt suggests they recognize the negative outcome, which might indicate they were wrong in their approach, even if the problem existed. \n\nI think the key here is whether the group handled the situation appropriately. They tried to help, but when that didn't work, they removed her, causing her distress. The author's role in pushing for removal without considering other solutions might make them the asshole. So the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
