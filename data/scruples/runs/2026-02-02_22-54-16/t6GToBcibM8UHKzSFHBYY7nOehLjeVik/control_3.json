Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D group where one player, Sarah, is taking a really long time to do the math for her turns. The main character (the author) is the one pushing to kick her out because of this. The group tried letting Adam help Sarah at work to speed up her turns, but it didn't work, and Sarah ended up upset and quitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of group activities and social interactions. D&D is a game that relies on everyone's participation and cooperation. If one person is taking an excessive amount of time, it affects the whole group's experience. The author's frustration might be valid because the game sessions are long, and the majority of the time is spent waiting for Sarah. But on the other hand, Sarah is genuinely trying her best and seems to enjoy the game. The group's approach might not have been the best way to handle the situation.\n\nThe key points here are the communication methods and the decision-making process. The group did try to give Sarah a chance, even allowing Adam to help her. However, when they decided to remove her, it led to an emotional breakdown. The author was the main one pushing for removal, which could be seen as insensitive. Even though the author's intention was to improve the flow of the game, the outcome was harmful to Sarah's feelings.\n\nBut is the author at fault? Maybe the problem isn't the decision to remove Sarah but how it was handled. Did they approach Sarah directly to discuss the issue before deciding to kick her out? The story doesn't mention a direct conversation where they could have offered alternative solutions, like pre-rolling dice or using calculators. Instead, they went through Adam, which might not have been the best approach. Also, the fact that Sarah was upset and left crying indicates that the method of removal was not handled with enough care or empathy.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to maintain the game's enjoyment for everyone. Group activities require some level of participation efficiency, especially when time is limited. However, the right approach would involve more support and accommodations. Since the group didn't explore all possible solutions and chose a more abrupt removal, that's where the problem lies. The author's role as the primary driver of the decision makes them more responsible for the outcome.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be the asshole, but the way they handled the situation was flawed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the decision to kick Sarah out was the right course of action. Since there were alternative solutions not explored, and the removal led to emotional harm, the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation more sensitively and considering other options.\n"
