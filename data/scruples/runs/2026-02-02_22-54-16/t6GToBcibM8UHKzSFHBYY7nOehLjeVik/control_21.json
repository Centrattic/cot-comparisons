Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this as I read the scenario. The user is asking if the person who kicked Sarah out of the D&D group is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe group had Sarah join, and she's been slow in doing the math during her turns. It takes her 7-8 minutes each turn, which is way longer than everyone else. They tried giving her another chance with Adam helping her at work, but it didn't work. Then, during a session, Sarah became frustrated, snapped, and cried before leaving. Now the user is feeling guilty and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here seem to be about the group's decision to remove Sarah. The user was the main one pushing for it because of the slow turns affecting game time. But Sarah was having fun even while struggling. The problem is the time it takes, which is causing the game to be unenjoyable for the others. But the way they handled it might be the issue.\n\nFirst, was the user wrong for wanting to address the issue? The game is supposed to be fun for everyone, and if one person is significantly slowing it down, that could be a legitimate concern. However, the approach taken might be problematic. The group discussed removing her, and Adam was the only one against it. The fact that the group texted and agreed to remove her after Adam's failed attempt to help her could be an issue. Maybe they should have tried more accommodations first, like using a calculator during sessions or having someone else help her with the math. D&D often involves a lot of calculations, so maybe the group should have considered that not everyone is comfortable with that and found ways to support her instead of excluding her.\n\nAlso, the user admits they were the most frustrated and the primary force in removing her. That's a red flag. If they were the one pushing for it and didn't consider other solutions, they might be at fault. The result was Sarah's emotional breakdown, which is a serious outcome. So even if the problem was real, the method of addressing it was harsh. The group could have talked to her privately, offered tools to help, or adjusted their expectations. They might have failed to consider her feelings and the possibility of finding a middle ground.\n\nAnother angle: D&D is a social activity, and part of the game can be learning together. Maybe the group should have been more patient and found ways to make it easier for her. The math isn't that hard, but if she's struggling, there's no reason to make her feel bad. The user's guilt is valid because they contributed to a situation that hurt someone's feelings. So, maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they took action without exhausting all possible solutions and without handling the sensitive situation with care, leading to a negative outcome.\n"
