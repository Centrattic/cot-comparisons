Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote that D&D group situation is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. I need to figure out which one makes more sense.\n\nFirst, I should break down the scenario. There's a D&D group of six guys, they meet weekly for two years. Adam invited his coworker Sarah to join. She's been playing for a few months. The main issue is that Sarah takes 7-8 minutes per turn because she's slow at adding single-digit and double-digit numbers. The group thought she was just nervous at first, but even with written formulas, she's still taking a long time. This is causing the game sessions to be inefficient, only getting about 90 minutes of play in a 3-4 hour session. They discussed removing her, except Adam. They gave her another chance with Adam helping at work, but that didn't work. Sarah became more frustrated and eventually snapped, crying, and left. The author feels guilty but initially wanted her out.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The key points are the impact on the group's experience versus Sarah's enjoyment and the feelings involved. The group's time is limited, and her slow turns are disrupting the flow. But on the other hand, they might have been too hasty in pushing to remove her. Did they offer enough support or alternative solutions before deciding? For example, maybe they could have given her more time, used a calculator, or adjusted the game to have her do fewer calculations. The fact that she was taking written formulas suggests she tried to adapt, but maybe the group didn't consider other accommodations. \n\nAlso, the group's decision to cut the session short and the emotional response from Sarah indicates that the situation was handled poorly. The author was the main one advocating for her removal, which might show a lack of empathy. Even if the group's time is important, causing someone to cry and leave seems harsh. The group might have prioritized their own convenience over her comfort and the potential to find other solutions. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were trying to maintain a good game experience for everyone and that they did give her a chance. But the outcome was negative, and the author is feeling guilty. The question is whether the action was justified. In social groups, fairness and consideration for all members are important. If the group's dynamic was suffering because of her play style, they might have a point, but the way they handled it (removing her after causing emotional distress) is questionable. \n\nI think the answer is A because the group, including the author, pushed for her removal without considering other possible solutions. The fact that she was enjoying the game despite the challenges suggests that they should have found a compromise instead of excluding her. The emotional fallout indicates that the approach was too harsh, and the author's frustration might have led them to act without enough empathy. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
