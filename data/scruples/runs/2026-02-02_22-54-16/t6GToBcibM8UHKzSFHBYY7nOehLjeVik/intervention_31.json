Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA question (the author) is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she can't do math quickly enough.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group has been playing D&D for two years. They invited Sarah through Adam, who's a coworker. Sarah takes a long time to do her turns, about 7-8 minutes each turn because she's slow with basic math. They tried giving her another chance with Adam helping her at work, but it didn't help. Sarah got frustrated, snapped, and left in tears.\n\nThe author feels guilty for pushing to remove her. They're asking if they're the asshole. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong, but they want to see what I think.\n\nHmm. D&D is a social activity that relies on everyone's participation. If one person is causing the game to drag and others are losing enjoyment due to the time lost, that's a problem for the group. But kicking someone out because of a skill they can't control (math speed) might be seen as harsh. However, the group did try to accommodate her by letting Adam help. When that failed, and Sarah was visibly upset, maybe they had to make a hard decision to keep their game enjoyable.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah was having fun despite her struggles. The group might have found a way to help her without removing her, like using calculators or pre-figured numbers. The fact that she ended up crying and left in anger complicates things. The author was the main driver for removing her, which adds to the guilt.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between group dynamics and individual circumstances. The answer might depend on whether they gave her all possible support before deciding to remove her. They did try Adam's help, but maybe there were other options. However, the time constraints of the game sessions (3-4 hours with only 90 minutes of actual gameplay) make it impractical to wait for someone who's significantly slower. \n\nSo, considering the group's right to enjoy their game versus individual limitations, the author might not be wrong. But it's a tough call. The key points are the group's effort to help, the failure of that effort, and the resulting emotional impact on Sarah. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they tried to accommodate and had legitimate concerns about the game's flow. However, some might say A because of the emotional toll. But given the context, B seems more appropriate.\n"
