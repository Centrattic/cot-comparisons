Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe group plays D&D with 6 people. Adam invited his coworker Sarah to join. The problem is her math speed. She takes way longer than others, even when she has formulas written down. The author wanted her out because it's taking too long and the game isn't fun anymore. They tried giving her another chance if Adam helped her at work, but that didn't work. Then Sarah had a breakdown and left.\n\nSo the question is, is the author the asshole here?\n\nFirst, D&D is a game that involves a lot of math. The group has been playing together for two years, so they probably developed a certain pace. Sarah's slowness is causing delays, making the game time suffer. The author was the main one pushing for her removal. But when they tried to address it, it led to Sarah being upset and crying. The author now feels guilty.\n\nOn one hand, the group's time is a valid concern. If one person's pace is ruining the experience for everyone, it's a problem. They tried to compromise by letting Adam help Sarah. But that didn't work, and it made Sarah frustrated. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe they should have considered other solutions first, like using calculators or apps to help with math, or perhaps taking turns more structured so Sarah can prepare ahead. Also, maybe the group could have given her more specific feedback on how to speed up instead of just asking Adam to help in a vague way.\n\nOn the other hand, the group did try to accommodate her by giving her another chance. However, when that backfired and Sarah ended up in tears, it's possible they didn't handle the situation sensitively. The author's primary role in pushing for her removal might have contributed to the pressure on Sarah, especially if the message was that her math speed was a problem. It's possible that the group could have found alternative solutions before considering removal, like role adjustments where she doesn't have to do as much math, or perhaps the DM could streamline combat.\n\nBut the key points here are that they did attempt to address the issue, and when that failed, Sarah's experience deteriorated. The author's actions might have been well-intentioned in terms of preserving the group's time, but they might not have thought through the emotional impact on Sarah. It's a balance between the group's time and someone's enjoyment. Since Sarah was having fun initially but then became frustrated, it's possible that the group's approach wasn't considerate enough of her feelings and the stress it caused her.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is valid, the way the situation was handled might have been inconsiderate of Sarah's feelings and the possible stressors they were putting on her. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they could have sought more alternatives or communicated better before deciding to remove her. The fact that she ended up crying and leaving suggests that the group's approach, with the author leading it, may have been harsh.\n"
