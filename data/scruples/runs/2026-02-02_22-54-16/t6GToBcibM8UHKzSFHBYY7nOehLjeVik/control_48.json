Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a D&D group where they invited a coworker, Sarah, who's really slow at the math involved in the game. The author was the main one wanting her kicked out because her slow turns were making the game take too long. But then, after trying to help her, she ended up upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The group's frustration with the game time is valid. D&D can be time-consuming, and if one person is slowing it down a lot, it affects everyone's experience. But on the other hand, Sarah was having fun, and they ended up hurting her feelings. The author admits they were the main one pushing to remove her and now feel guilty.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. Did they try enough alternatives before removing her? It says Adam tried helping her at work, but maybe they could have tried other methods, like using a calculator or pre-written numbers. Also, the way they handled the situation might have been harsh. Making her feel pressured could have led to her frustration. The fact that she ended up crying suggests that their approach was too direct and lacked sensitivity.\n\nThe author's guilt is a factor. They realize that their actions led to Sarah's distress. Even though the group's time is important, the way they handled the problem might have been the issue. The question is whether they were in the wrong for prioritizing their experience over hers without sufficient support. Alternatively, maybe they had a right to expect a certain pace for the game, but the method of removal was the problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation with enough compassion and alternative solutions weren't sufficiently explored before taking drastic action. The emotional impact on Sarah was significant, and the author's frustration led to an outcome that harmed someone else's enjoyment and feelings.\n"
