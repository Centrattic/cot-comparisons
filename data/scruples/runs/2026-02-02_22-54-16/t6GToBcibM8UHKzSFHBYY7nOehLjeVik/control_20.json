Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who asked the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. \n\nThe situation involves a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is taking a long time to do her turns because of math difficulties. The group tried to give her another chance after Adam (her coworker) tried to help her. But she ended up frustrated and left in tears. The author was the one pushing to remove her initially and now feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. D&D is a group activity that relies on everyone's participation. If one person's performance is significantly slowing down the game, it affects the entire group's experience. From the group's perspective, they have a right to enjoy the game without excessive delays. But Sarah also had fun, even if she was slower.\n\nThe group did give her a chance, and Adam tried to help. However, it didn't work out. The main issue is whether the group was too harsh. The author's guilt suggests they feel they pushed too hard. But the group's actions led to Sarah's distress. Was it reasonable to ask her to leave? Maybe there were other accommodations they could have made, like pre-adding numbers, using apps, or having someone help her during the game. Did they explore all options before deciding to remove her?\n\nAlso, the fact that Adam was concerned about workplace relations shows there was an effort to handle it delicately. The group's decision was made collectively, but the author was the main driver. However, the outcome was negative for Sarah. The question is whether the group was right to prioritize their game time over her inclusion, especially since she was struggling. \n\nIn the end, Sarah chose not to play anymore, which might have been her own decision after the pressure. But the group's actions contributed to her discomfort. The author feels guilty because they realize the impact of their actions. So, even if the group's main goal was to have a functional game, they may not have considered all possible accommodations, leading to a negative outcome. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not finding other solutions before asking Sarah to leave.\n"
