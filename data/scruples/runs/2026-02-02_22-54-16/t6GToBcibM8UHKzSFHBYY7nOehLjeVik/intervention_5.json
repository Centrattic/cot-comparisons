Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. They provided a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario where the author is considering kicking a D&D player, Sarah, out of the group because she can't do math quickly enough. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The D&D group has six members, and Sarah, a coworker of Adam's, was invited to join. She's been playing for a few months but her turns take 7-8 minutes each, which is much longer than the 1-2 minutes the others take. The group considered removing her, but Adam was concerned about work relationships. They gave her another chance with Adam trying to help her, but that didn't work. Sarah became frustrated and eventually snapped and cried, leading her to leave the group. Now the author is feeling guilty.\n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The game's structure relies on math (basic addition, subtraction).\n2. Sarah's slow pace disrupts the flow and enjoyment for the group.\n3. The group tried to help her, but it didn't resolve the issue.\n4. The situation escalated emotionally, leading to her breakdown.\n\nThe author's question is whether they are in the wrong for wanting to kick Sarah out. The user says the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, D&D is a group activity that depends on everyone's participation and time. If one person's pace is significantly slowing it down, it can affect everyone's enjoyment. The group did make an effort to accommodate her by giving her another chance and having Adam assist, which shows they tried to be fair. However, if the math is essential to the game and Sarah's inability to handle it quickly is a hindrance, it might be a legitimate issue for the group's dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah was clearly having fun, and the group's actions led to her emotional distress. The author was the main person pushing for her removal. Even though they tried to help, the outcome was negative. The question is about whether the group (and the author) should have found another way to handle the situation without removing her. Maybe there were other accommodations, like using a calculator or pre-calculating certain values, that could have been tried before kicking her out. \n\nBut the author did mention that Adam tried to help her at work, and that didn't work. So perhaps they exhausted options that seemed feasible. However, the group didn't mention trying alternative solutions during the game sessions. For example, maybe someone could assist her during the game, or the DM could simplify certain mechanics for her. It's possible that the group didn't consider these options and went straight to removal. \n\nThe author's intent was to improve the game experience for everyone, but the method might have been too harsh. The emotional impact on Sarah is a significant factor. Even if the math is part of the game, if the group didn't handle the situation with enough sensitivity, they might have contributed to her stress. The snap at the end and crying suggest that their approach was not effective in a compassionate way.\n\nSo, while the author might not be the sole person at fault, the way they handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. The group's primary issue was with the game's pace, but they didn't consider other solutions that don't involve expulsion. The author's frustration is understandable, but the outcome was negative. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach lacked sufficient empathy and alternative solutions weren't explored thoroughly before taking such a step.\n"
