Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a D&D group where a player, Sarah, is taking a long time to do the math during her turns. The group, including the author, decided to kick her out because the game was taking too long, but it led to Sarah crying and leaving. Now the author feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the group has a limited time each week for their game, and Sarah's slow pace is causing everyone else to lose out on game time. The author mentions that it's not just a little slow, but 10 times longer than others, which is a big difference. They tried giving her a chance and even asked Adam to help her at work, but it didn't work. The group's main issue is the game time being wasted, which affects everyone's enjoyment.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah genuinely enjoys the game, and being kicked out made her upset. The author was the main push for removing her, which led to her emotional breakdown. The group didn't handle it well, maybe not giving her enough support or alternative solutions. They might have considered other options, like having someone help her with calculations or adjusting the game to be more efficient without removing her entirely.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to improve the game experience for everyone, but the method used hurt someone. Was there a better way to handle it? Maybe. The group could have explored accommodations first, like using a calculator, pre-rolling some stats, or having a helper. But in the end, the group's frustration led to a harsh outcome. The author's role as the primary driver of the decision might make them feel responsible, but it's a group decision. The key here is whether the action of removing Sarah was necessary or if there were other solutions.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because they tried to address the problem, but they could have handled it more compassionately. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be A (yes) because the approach caused harm, but maybe B (no) because they were trying to maintain the game's flow. It's a tough balance. I'm leaning towards A because the outcome was negative and they could have found other solutions, but I'm not sure.\n"
