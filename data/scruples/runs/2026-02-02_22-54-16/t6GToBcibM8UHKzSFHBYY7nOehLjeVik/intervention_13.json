Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group where a new player, Sarah, is really slow at doing the math required for her turns. The author, who's part of the group, wanted her to leave because her slow pace was making the game sessions too long and not fun. They tried giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work out, leading to Sarah getting upset and leaving.\n\nHmm, the first thing I need to consider is the social dynamics here. D&D is a group activity that relies on everyone's participation. If one person is causing the game to drag, it's affecting the enjoyment of everyone else. The author mentions that each session is 3-4 hours, but they only get about 90 minutes of actual gameplay because of the slow turns. That's a lot of time wasted. So from a group enjoyment perspective, maybe the author had a valid reason to be frustrated.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of being inclusive and considering Sarah's feelings. She was having fun, even though she was struggling. The group did try to help her improve by having Adam assist her, but that didn't work. When they decided to kick her out, it led to her emotional breakdown. That's a big problem. The author admits feeling guilty now, which suggests they might have realized that their actions had negative consequences.\n\nAnother angle is whether the group could have found alternative solutions. Maybe they could have adjusted the game to make math easier for Sarah, like using pre-calculated numbers or apps, or having someone else help her during the game. It's possible they didn't explore all options before deciding to remove her. The fact that Adam was concerned about work relations and Sarah's feelings might indicate that the group didn't handle the situation sensitively enough.\n\nThe author was the primary driver in wanting to remove Sarah, which makes them more responsible. While the group as a whole might share some blame, the question is about the author specifically. The key points are intent versus outcome. The author's intent was to improve the game experience for everyone, but the outcome was hurting Sarah. However, the group didn't give enough alternatives or support, and the way they handled the removal was harsh, leading to Sarah's distress.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? If they hadn't considered other solutions and acted on frustration without ensuring Sarah's comfort, then maybe they are at fault. However, if the group collectively made the decision and the author was just one member, the responsibility is shared. But since the author initiated the removal and pushed for it, their role is more significant.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, being honest about the issue might be necessary, but the way they communicated it was problematic. The group should have approached Sarah with empathy, perhaps suggesting ways to speed up her turns or adjust the game rather than excluding her. The fact that she ended up crying and leaving shows that the approach was hurtful.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their own enjoyment and the group's time over Sarah's feelings and didn't explore all possible solutions. They didn't handle the situation with enough care and sensitivity, leading to a negative outcome. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
