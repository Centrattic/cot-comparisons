Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking Sarah out of their D&D group because she couldn't do math quickly enough. The scenario is that Sarah was taking much longer than others during her turns, causing delays and frustration. The group tried to help her by having Adam (her coworker and friend) assist her, but it didn't work, leading to Sarah's emotional breakdown and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author's main issue is that Sarah's math speed is affecting the game's flow. However, the problem escalated to the point where Sarah was upset and left crying. The author was the main person pushing to remove her, which is causing guilt now.\n\nD&D involves a lot of player participation and interaction. If one player is taking significantly longer, it can disrupt the game for everyone, which the author and group might have valid reasons to be frustrated. However, the way they handled it seems problematic. They gave Sarah a chance through Adam's help, but when that failed, they didn't perhaps explore other accommodations. For example, maybe they could have let her use a calculator or pre-written math help, or took turns helping her with calculations to make it faster without making her feel pressured. \n\nThe fact that Sarah was having fun despite the slowness and then became frustrated and upset under pressure suggests that the approach taken by the group was too harsh. The author's frustration is understandable, but the solution was to remove her instead of finding a more inclusive way to handle the situation. The emotional impact on Sarah is significant, and it seems the group prioritized their own enjoyment over her well-being, which is a red flag. \n\nAdditionally, the group didn't communicate their concerns directly with Sarah, which might have led to misunderstandings. They let Adam handle it, but that might not have been sufficient to address the root issue. The author's guilt after the fact indicates that they realize the approach was hurtful, even if the initial problem existed. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a valid issue with the game's pacing, the method used to address it\u2014removing Sarah without trying other solutions\u2014was likely the wrong approach. The author and group could have been more empathetic and found alternative solutions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
