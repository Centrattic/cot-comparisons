Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who initiated kicking Sarah out of the D&D group is in the wrong. The scenario is about a group that plays weekly, and Sarah, a new player, is taking too long with the math, causing delays and frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. D&D does involve a lot of calculations, and while the math isn't complex, it's frequent. The group mentions that turns are typically 1-2 minutes, but Sarah's take 7-8 minutes. This is significantly longer and affecting the game time. The group tried to give her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work out. Eventually, Sarah had an emotional breakdown, and the group ended up excluding her.\n\nThe author feels guilty because they were the main push behind removing Sarah. They acknowledge that she enjoyed the game, but the slowdown was impacting everyone's experience. The question is whether this decision was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the group's time is limited, and if one person's pace is causing significant delays, it's reasonable to address it. They did give her a chance and tried to help, but it didn't improve. The frustration from the group is understandable, and they might have communicated their concerns before deciding to remove her.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah's feelings and enjoyment were affected. The emotional response suggests that the approach might have been harsh. Maybe there were other solutions, like letting her take notes, using a calculator, or having someone assist her. However, the group did attempt to accommodate her by giving her another chance, which Adam tried to facilitate.\n\nThe key points are the group's attempt to help and the fact that despite their efforts, the problem persisted. The author's frustration might have been valid if the group's social time is being compromised. However, the outcome of Sarah's breakdown indicates that the approach might not have been handled sensitively. The question is whether the decision to remove her was justified despite the emotional consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the group had valid concerns about the game's pace, the way they handled it might have been too abrupt, leading to negative outcomes. The author's intentions might have been to preserve the group's enjoyment, but the method could have been improved. However, considering that they tried to help and the situation didn't improve, the decision might not be entirely their fault.\n"
