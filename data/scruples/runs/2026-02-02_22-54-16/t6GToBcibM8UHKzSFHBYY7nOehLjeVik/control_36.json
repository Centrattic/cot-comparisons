Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who asked the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where a player, Sarah, is being kicked out because she's too slow at doing the math during her turns. The author admits they were the main one pushing to remove her and now feel guilty after Sarah had an emotional breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. D&D is a game that requires some math, but it's not overly complex. The group consists of friends who play regularly, and Sarah was invited by a member, Adam. The main issue is the game's pace. Sarah's turns take 7-8 minutes because she's slow with basic calculations, which affects the whole group's experience. The group tried giving her another chance, with Adam helping her at work, but that didn't work, leading to Sarah's frustration and eventual breakdown.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they wanted to maintain the game's flow and everyone's enjoyment. However, the way they handled it might be problematic. They pushed for removal without maybe exploring all possible solutions. The group did try to accommodate Sarah by giving her another chance, but it seems they didn't consider other alternatives, like allowing her to use a calculator or having someone assist her during the game. Those options could have been less confrontational and more supportive.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on Sarah is significant. The fact that she started crying and left angry suggests that the group's approach hurt her feelings. Even though the author's intention was to keep the game fun for everyone, they didn't consider the social aspect and the potential harm to Sarah. The fact that Adam was concerned about work dynamics shows that there were other factors to consider beyond just the game's pace.\n\nIn terms of fairness, while the group has a right to enjoy their game, they also have a responsibility to be inclusive and supportive, especially when someone is a guest and genuinely enjoys the activity. The author's primary role in pushing for her removal, despite the emotional consequences, might mean they overlooked the social responsibility aspect. It's a balance between group needs and individual inclusion.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions led to a negative outcome for Sarah. Even if the initial intention was to improve the game experience, the method and outcome suggest they might be in the wrong. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't explore all alternatives and their actions caused emotional distress.\n"
