Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group where one member, Sarah, is taking too long to do the math during her turns. The author, who is part of the group, wanted her to leave because it was affecting the game's flow and everyone else's enjoyment. They tried giving her a chance to improve with Adam's help, but it didn't work out, leading to an emotional breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the group. D&D requires a lot of math, and Sarah's inability to handle it quickly was causing delays. The group met weekly for two years, so this is a regular commitment. If each session is only getting 90 minutes of actual gameplay out of 3-4 hours, that's a problem. The author's frustration is understandable because they wanted the game to be fun for everyone.\n\nBut then, Sarah was genuinely having fun, even if she was slow. The group tried to help her improve before deciding to remove her. The author's primary role was to push for her removal, which might have contributed to the pressure on Sarah. When Adam mentioned the need for faster gameplay, Sarah became frustrated and eventually left in tears. That's a significant emotional impact.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they were concerned about the game's pace, which is a valid concern. However, the way they handled it might have been harsh. They didn't give Sarah enough support or alternative solutions. Maybe they could have tried other methods, like allowing her to use a calculator or pre-written numbers to speed up her turns. The group's approach of giving her a chance to improve with Adam's help didn't work, but perhaps there were other accommodations they could have made instead of removing her.\n\nThe emotional breakdown suggests that the group's actions had a negative effect on Sarah. The author, being the main advocate for her removal, might bear some responsibility. But D&D is a game that everyone should enjoy. If Sarah's presence was making others unhappy, there's a balance to strike. However, the outcome was that Sarah stopped playing and was upset, which is a heavy consequence.\n\nIn the end, the group did try to help her, but maybe not in the most supportive way. The author's intention was to improve the game experience for the whole group, but the execution led to hurting Sarah's feelings. So, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting the game to run smoothly, they might have failed to consider Sarah's emotional well-being and look for other solutions. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But given the emotional impact, the answer might lean towards the author being at fault.\n"
