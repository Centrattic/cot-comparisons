Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their D&D group because the person can't do math quickly enough.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group plays D&D weekly, and Sarah, a new player invited by Adam, is taking a very long time on her turns\u2014like 7-8 minutes per turn. The math involved isn't extremely hard, just adding numbers, but she's really slow at it. The group tried giving her another chance after Adam helped her at work, but it didn't help. Eventually, Sarah became frustrated, snapped, and left in tears.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty because they were the one pushing to remove her and now it's causing emotional distress. They're questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, D&D is a social activity that relies on everyone's participation and time. If one person is holding up the whole group, it can ruin the experience for everyone. The group's time is limited, and they're not getting enough game in a session because of the delays. The author's frustration is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, Sarah was genuinely having fun, and the group's decision to remove her might have been harsh. They tried to help her improve, but it didn't work. The pressure put on her made her uncomfortable, leading to her breakdown. The author's actions, while maybe well-intentioned for the group's enjoyment, might have been insensitive to Sarah's feelings and her personal limitations. D&D is a cooperative game, and maybe there were other ways to accommodate her, like pre-calculating some numbers or using tools, rather than removing her from the group.\n\nThe key points are: the group's enjoyment vs. individual's ability to participate. The author was the main advocate for removal, which is a significant decision affecting someone's social activity. Even if the group was on board, the outcome was negative for Sarah. The question is whether the author's approach was fair or if there were other solutions they could have tried first.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because they didn't explore all possible accommodations and the decision led to someone's emotional distress. While the group's time is important, the way they handled it was harsh. They could have considered using tools like calculators, apps, or having someone help her during the game. Removing her was a drastic step that prioritized the majority's experience over her well-being. The guilt the author feels suggests they realize the impact of their actions. So, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
