Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who posted the D&D group situation is the asshole for kicking Sarah out because she couldn't do math quickly.\n\nFirst, the context: The group plays D&D weekly, and Sarah, a coworker of Adam's, joined. The issue is her taking 7-8 minutes per turn due to struggling with basic math, which slows down the game for everyone. They tried giving her another chance with Adam's help, but it didn't work, leading to Sarah getting frustrated and crying, then leaving.\n\nThe author feels guilty because they were the main one pushing to remove her. The key points here are about group dynamics, fairness, and empathy. \n\nD&D requires some math, but it's supposed to be fun. The group's time is limited, and if one person's pace is affecting everyone's enjoyment, it's a problem. However, the way they handled it might be where the issue lies. They tried to help Sarah with Adam's assistance, but that didn't work. When they removed her, it caused her emotional distress. The author was the most frustrated and the main force behind the decision.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their game time without unnecessary delays. On the other, they didn't handle it in the most supportive way. Maybe they could have found alternatives, like using a calculator or having someone assist her during the game to keep things moving without making her feel bad. The fact that Sarah was having fun but struggling suggests that there might have been other solutions they didn't explore. \n\nThe author's guilt and the outcome (Sarah crying and leaving) indicate that their approach, while possibly well-intentioned, was harsh. The key here is whether the group considered all possible accommodations before deciding to remove her. If they didn't make reasonable adjustments, then they might be in the wrong. But if the problem was insurmountable and despite efforts to help, then maybe not. However, the negative emotional impact on Sarah suggests that the group could have handled it better, making the author at least partially at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't adequately address the issue with empathy and alternatives before taking a harsh action, leading to harm.\n"
