Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who asked the \"Am I the Asshole?\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where a player, Sarah, is taking too long to do the math during her turns. The group eventually removes her, but she ends up upset and crying.\n\nThe author of the question is the one who initially pushed for her removal and now feels guilty. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know if I agree with that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, Sarah was struggling with the math, which is a part of the game. The group's time is limited, and her slow pace was causing everyone else to feel like they're not getting enough playtime. The group did try to work with her by giving Adam the chance to help her improve. However, that didn't work, and Sarah ended up feeling pressured and frustrated. The situation escalated to the point where she had an emotional breakdown and left the group.\n\nOn the other hand, D&D is a game that involves math, but it's not overly complex. Maybe there are ways to accommodate someone who's slower at calculations, like using a calculator or having someone assist her. The group might have been too hasty in removing her without exploring all possible solutions. The author's frustration is understandable, but the outcome was harmful to Sarah's feelings.\n\nThe author's actions led to Sarah's distress, even if the intention was to maintain the game's pace. They might not be in the wrong because they were trying to balance the group's needs, but they could have handled it differently. However, the emotional impact on Sarah is significant. The question is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nThe options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The user thinks it's B. I need to decide based on the situation. The group did attempt to address the issue before removing her, but the method might have been too harsh. The emotional harm caused by kicking her out was significant. The author's primary motivation was frustration, but the outcome was negative. So, there's a case for A because their actions led to Sarah's distress. But if the group collectively decided, and the author was just part of that group, maybe not entirely their fault. However, since the author was the main driver, they bear more responsibility.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A because the way they handled it caused harm, even if the problem existed. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's B because they tried to solve it first. The line between being reasonable and being inconsiderate is thin here. The key point is that Sarah was having fun but unable to keep up, and the group's solution backfired. The author's guilt might be justified because they didn't consider alternatives like using tools or role adjustments. So, maybe A.\n"
