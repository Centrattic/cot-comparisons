Quick context.  I play D&amp;D with a group of 6 guys.  We meet each week, and the group is about 2 years old at this point.  One of the players (Adam) invited a coworker (Sarah) to join us for a few games.\n\nSo in D&amp;D there is a lot of math.  Not difficult math, but a lot of it.  Basically in combat you roll dice, add or subtract based on your character's stats, and use the final result to determine if you hit an enemy, how much damage you do, or if you escape a spell or trap.  It really is mostly single digit addition with some double digit thrown in.  Nothing too tricky.  At least not for most people.\n\nSarah has been playing with us for a few months now, and on average it takes her about 10 times as long to take a turn as it does anyone else at the table.  I don't mind someone being a bit slower on the mental math aspects of the game, but this woman actually has turns that go over 7-8 minutes because it takes her a full minute to add 3 single digit numbers together.  At first we thought it was because she was learning the rules and might have been nervous playing for the first time, but she has all the formulas written down.  It just takes her that long to do the calculations.  According to Adam she is known for being slow at work as well.\n\nWell at this point she is taking so long that we are losing a lot of our limited game time just sitting around waiting on her to finish her turn.  A rotation at the table is basically all of us taking 1-2 minute turns, the DM taking 3-4 minutes (since he is controlling all the baddies so it takes awhile) and then Sarah taking almost as long as all of us combined.  It sucks.  It isn't fun only getting maybe 90 minutes of game done in a 3-4 hour session.\n\nWe group text after the game and talk about maybe removing Sarah from the group.  Everyone seems on board with the idea except for Adam who doesn't want to things to be awkward at work should she be kicked from the group.  He also argues that she is having a lot of fun which is true.  Even when she is struggling to do her turns she does seem to genuinely have fun.  So we agree to give her another chance if Adam can take some time at work and see if he can get her to speed her turns up a bit.  Adam agrees and all seems well.\n\nIt turns out we're all idiots, and Adam spending some time during lunch over the course of a week cannot magically make Sarah better at mental math.  She's just as slow as before, but now she looks frustrated when she is counting.  Adam had mentioned that we needed the game to go faster, and so now the pressure was on her and it definitely showed.  Now Sarah was more annoyed and short with us during the session and was clearly not having fun anymore.  By the end of the session Sarah ends up snapping at me and another player and started to cry.  We decided to cut the session off there after she stormed outside and Adam ended up comforting her and taking her home.\n\nThis was last week and other than a text saying \"Sarah won't be doing D&amp;D anymore\" he has been pretty quiet for all of us.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  We basically introduced someone to a game they really enjoyed, but because she couldn't do math fast enough we ended up making her break down in tears and leave angry at us instead of having fun.  I was the primary driving force initially to remove her from the game, and I was definitely the most frustrated by her.  Now that it has happened though I just feel really guilty.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is part of a D&D group where they invited Sarah, Adam's coworker. The main issue is that Sarah takes way too long to do the math during her turns, even though the math isn't that complex. This is causing the game to drag, and the other players are frustrated. They tried giving her another chance after Adam tried to help, but it didn't work out, and Sarah ended up upset and leaving in tears.\n\nFirst, I should consider the social dynamics. D&D is a group activity that requires everyone's participation. If one person's pace is significantly slowing down the game, it affects the enjoyment for everyone else. The author mentions that they tried to be accommodating by giving Sarah time to learn and even another chance after Adam's intervention. However, Sarah's frustration and emotional reaction led to her leaving, which is a big deal.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the group's decision to remove Sarah was to maintain the game's flow, which is understandable. They wanted to enjoy their limited game time. On the other hand, Sarah genuinely seemed to enjoy the game, and the way it was handled might have been insensitive. The author was the main one pushing for her removal, which might have come off as harsh, especially leading to Sarah's emotional breakdown.\n\nBut D&D can't function if one person is holding everyone back. The math part is essential for gameplay, and if someone can't keep up, it's a problem. The group tried to be fair by giving her multiple chances. However, maybe they could have handled it differently, like offering more help or adjusting the game's math complexity for her. But the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to protect the group's experience.\n\nAnother angle: the author's frustration is valid. They were the most affected and took initiative. But the outcome was hurtful. However, the problem was Sarah's inability to perform the necessary tasks, not the author's actions. They followed up with attempts to resolve it, so maybe they aren't the asshole here.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they tried to address the issue constructively, even if the outcome was negative. But if the group could have found a more supportive solution, maybe they share some responsibility. But the question is specifically about the author's role. They were proactive but perhaps not malicious. So leaning towards B.\n"
