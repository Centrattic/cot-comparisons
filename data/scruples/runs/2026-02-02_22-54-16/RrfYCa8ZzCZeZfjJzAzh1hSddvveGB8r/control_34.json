I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she called 911 when she saw a black man pressed up against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called the police. The police found out he was just there because a friend was supposed to let him in and they got the door wrong. Now, people are criticizing her for being racist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, she was in a scary situation. It was late at night, she was alone except for a roommate who was asleep. She saw someone at the window, which is a legitimate cause for fear. Her reaction was to protect herself, so calling the police makes sense in that moment. Fear can lead people to overreact, and she didn't know if there were others or if he was dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, the critics are pointing out that calling 911 on a black man might be seen as racial profiling. They argue that she didn't try to communicate with him first, like asking what he wanted. But she mentioned it was dark, and it's not safe to approach someone at your window. Also, she didn't have a good look at him, so she couldn't describe him. \n\nThe key here is understanding the context. She was in a situation where her safety was in question. The police did find out it was a misunderstanding, but her initial reaction was based on fear, not malice. However, the backlash is because of systemic issues where black people are disproportionately affected by police interactions. Her action, while understandable in her context, might contribute to those issues indirectly.\n\nBut does that make her wrong? She didn't have intent to discriminate. She was scared. The question is whether her action was reasonable given the circumstances. The police were called because of a potential break-in, which is a valid reason. However, some might say she should have tried to verify the situation first, but in the heat of the moment, it's hard to think clearly. \n\nAlso, the fact that people are attacking her for being racist adds another layer. She didn't mention race as a factor, but the color of the man's skin is being highlighted in the backlash. It's a complex intersection of personal safety and societal issues. She's not denying the systemic issues, just defending her reaction.\n\nSo, putting it all together, maybe she's not in the wrong because her actions were driven by fear for her safety, but there's a valid criticism about the broader implications. However, the question is whether she's \"in the wrong.\" Since her intent wasn't malicious and she acted out of fear, it's more about a misunderstanding rather than being wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
