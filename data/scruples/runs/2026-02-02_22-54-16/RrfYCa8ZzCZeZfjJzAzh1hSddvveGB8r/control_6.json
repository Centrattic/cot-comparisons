I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The story is about a female college student who called 911 after seeing a black man pressing against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, didn't know if the window was locked, and thought he might be trying to break in. The police arrived and found out he was supposed to be in a nearby unit but got confused. Now she's facing backlash from classmates accusing her of racism.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her action of calling 911 was wrong. The key points here are her state of mind and the circumstances. She was alone, in a scary situation, couldn't see clearly, and was in a vulnerable position. Her primary concern was her safety. From a legal standpoint, in the US, people have the right to call emergency services if they feel threatened, regardless of the person's race. However, the backlash is coming from others who think she should have considered the man's intentions more, possibly leading to accusations of racial bias.\n\nOn the other hand, the police confirmed that the man had a legitimate reason but was in the wrong place. The author didn't know he was black until after the fact, and she emphasized she would have called regardless of his race. But the fact that he's black is adding to the racial tension in the situation. \n\nNow, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The answer isn't straightforward. Legally, she's not in the wrong because she acted out of fear for her safety. Socially and ethically, some might argue that she should have hesitated more or considered that he might not be a threat. However, in a high-stress, potentially dangerous situation, her reaction is understandable. The backlash is harsh because it's easy to judge from a safe perspective, but it's important to consider the fear she was experiencing. \n\nThe key here is that she didn't have information and was acting in self-defense. The police found out the man was harmless, but that doesn't negate her right to feel unsafe and to seek help. The criticism she's facing is more about the societal context of racial profiling, even though she claims not to have intended that. The answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuanced aspect where her overreaction might be seen as problematic, even if unintentional. However, given the circumstances, her actions were defensive and within her rights.\n"
