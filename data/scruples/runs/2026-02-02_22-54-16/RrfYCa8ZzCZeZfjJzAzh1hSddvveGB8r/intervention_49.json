I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a female college student who calls 911 after seeing a man outside her window at 2 a.m. The man said \"Let me in,\" which scared her, leading her to scream, lock herself in, and call the police. The backlash she's facing is that people are accusing her of racism because the man was black.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author claims she was scared because a man was pressing against her window, saying \"Let me in\" at night. She didn't have time to verify who he was or his intentions. Her actions were based on fear for her safety. The police later found out he had a friend who was expecting him, so there was a mix-up with the door. \n\nOn the other side, people are criticizing her for calling 911 without knowing the man's intentions, suggesting she should have talked to him first. They also bring up racial tensions, implying that she might have acted differently if the man were white. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she didn't recognize the man, couldn't describe him, and was in a state of panic. She doesn't deny that her reaction might be seen as overcautious but emphasizes her fear and the lack of information. She also acknowledges the broader issue of racial disparities with police, but clarifies she never compared her experience to those of black people.\n\nNow, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Legally, she called 911 when she felt threatened, which is a reasonable response in an emergency. The police confirmed there was someone there who was supposed to be in another unit, so her call led to a resolution. However, the social backlash is about the fear of racial profiling and the impact on the man who was called. \n\nBut from her account, she didn't know his race when she called 911. The color of his skin wasn't a factor in her decision-making at the time, as she didn't get a good look. She's also aware of the potential for overreaction but was acting on instinct in a scary situation. \n\nI think her actions were justified given the circumstances. She was alone, scared, and couldn't take chances. The backlash might stem from good intentions but not considering the fear she experienced. However, there's also a valid point about the potential harm of calling police on someone who wasn't a threat, which can have broader societal implications. But in this specific case, she acted out of self-defense. \n\nSo, considering all that, I lean towards her not being in the wrong. She made a difficult decision under stress, and while the outcome wasn't as severe as possible, her primary concern was her safety. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
