I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The options are A or B, where A means the author is in the wrong and B means they're not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly. The author, a female college student, called 911 after seeing a man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called the police. The police later explained that the man had a friend expecting him and got confused with the doors. The backlash she's facing is criticizing her for calling 911 on a black man, suggesting she's racist, and comparing it to other racial incidents.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, her actions were driven by fear and self-preservation. She couldn't see clearly due to the dark and was alone, with only one roommate asleep. Her instinct was to protect herself, which is a natural reaction. She acknowledges that the backlash might be because of her race, but she doesn't compare her experience to that of black individuals, which is important.\n\nNow, considering the arguments against her. Some might say that calling 911 without verifying the situation could be an overreaction. But given the circumstances\u2014late at night, someone at the window, the fear of being attacked\u2014it's a reasonable response. The police didn't escalate the situation once they found the man, which suggests there was no immediate threat. However, the social backlash is harsh, accusing her of racism, which is a sensitive issue.\n\nThe key points here are self-defense vs. racial profiling. The author didn't know the man's race when she called 911. Her reaction was based on the situation: someone at the window at night, asking to come in. While the backlash is about race, the author herself didn't consider the man's race at the time of the call. However, the fact that she's being criticized for the race of the person complicates things. It's possible that people are projecting their own biases onto her actions, assuming she acted out of racial prejudice rather than fear.\n\nThe author also reflects on the possibility that her reaction might be seen as overzealous, but she's trying to understand both sides. Her intention wasn't to harm or discriminate, but to ensure her safety. The social backlash is causing her distress, and she's trying to reconcile her fear with the societal expectations around calling the police on people of color.\n\nIn legal terms, calling 911 in a situation where you fear for your safety is generally acceptable. The police's response was appropriate, and the man wasn't a threat. However, in the context of societal issues surrounding racial bias and police interactions, some people might view her actions as contributing to systemic problems, even if unintended.\n\nSo, where does this leave the author? Legally, she's not in the wrong for calling 911. Emotionally, she's dealing with justified fear and the aftermath of others' misinterpretations. The backlash is unfair in that it accuses her of racism without evidence, but her actions were based on her immediate fear and self-defense. The complexity here is balancing individual safety with broader societal concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author made a reasonable decision based on her circumstances, the criticism she's facing is partly due to the racial context of the situation. However, her intent wasn't racist, and she's reflecting on her actions. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for calling 911, but the situation highlights the need for better understanding of both self-defense and racial tensions.\n"
