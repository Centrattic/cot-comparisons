I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author called 911 after seeing a black man pressing against her window, saying \"Let me in.\" She was scared, locked herself in, and called the police. The police later found out the man was supposed to go to a nearby unit but got confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was a female college student, alone in the house because one roommate was away and the other was asleep. It was 2 AM, and she encountered someone at her window. The man made eye contact and said \"Let me in,\" which could be perceived as a threat. Her reaction was fear-based, leading her to call 911. She didn't have time to assess if the man was a threat beyond that initial moment. \n\nNow, the backlash she's facing is significant. People are accusing her of racism, saying she should have approached the situation differently, like asking what he wanted. But in a high-stress, scary situation, especially when alone and vulnerable, the instinct is to seek help immediately. The police found that the man didn't have malicious intent, but that doesn't mean her fear was unfounded. People might not be in a position to judge her reaction without experiencing that fear themselves.\n\nAnother angle is the systemic issue of racial profiling. However, the author didn't mention the man's race when calling 911. She emphasized that she would have called regardless of his race, which suggests her reaction was based on the situation, not his skin color. But the fact that the backlash is highlighting the race complicates things. The article mentions that the man was Black, so the situation intersects with real-world concerns about how Black individuals are treated by the police. However, the author's intent was safety, not discrimination. \n\nThe key points are: her state of fear, the context of being alone at night, the man's actions (pressing against the window and saying \"Let me in\"), and the subsequent police response. Legally, she might not be in the wrong because her actions were in self-defense. Ethically, it's more nuanced. She's being criticized for not trying to resolve the situation before calling the police, but in a panic, that's not always feasible. Also, considering the potential danger of a stranger at her window, her reaction is understandable.\n\nThe author also acknowledges that her reaction might be seen as overcautious and is sensitive to the concerns of people of color regarding police interactions. She doesn't make the comparison herself, which is important. The backlash is partly due to the man being Black, which brings in societal tensions about racial bias. However, the author's intent wasn't to discriminate; she was scared. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's room for reflection on how to handle such situations differently in the future, the immediate action of calling 911 in fear for her safety isn't necessarily wrong. The real issue is the misunderstanding and judgment from others, which doesn't consider the context of her fear and the potential risks she faced.\n"
