I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man in this situation. Let me start by reading through the details again to make sure I understand the context.\n\nThe author is a college student who wakes up at 2:00 AM, goes to the kitchen for a snack, and sees a man pressed against the window. She's scared, screams, locks herself in the closet, calls 911, and texts her roommate. The police find out the man was supposed to visit a friend with an unlocked door but got confused. Now, classmates are mocking her and accusing her of racism, saying she should have talked to him first or not called the police because of his race.\n\nFirst, I should consider the circumstances. The author was alone (except for an asleep roommate), in a potentially unsafe situation. She saw someone at her window, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in,\" which is a scary scenario. Her immediate reaction was to call the police, which is a safety measure. She didn't have time to assess the situation calmly and was in panic mode.\n\nOn the other hand, the backlash she's receiving is pointing out that she didn't approach the man to ask what he wanted, which some people argue was unnecessary. Also, since the man turned out to be a friend of a classmate, it seems like a misunderstanding. The criticism includes accusations of racism, implying she called the police because he was black, which is a sensitive issue given the real problems of racial profiling.\n\nBut the author clarifies that she didn't get a good look at him and that her reaction was based on fear, not race. She also acknowledges that black people face different dangers with police. However, she's being accused of contributing to negative stereotypes by overreacting. The question is whether her action was justified or if she was wrong to call 911.\n\nI need to weigh the fear for personal safety against the societal context of racial bias. In emergencies, people are often advised to err on the side of caution. But in this case, the situation turned out not to be a threat, which complicates things. The author's intention wasn't to harm the man, but her action did lead to police involvement, which can be dangerous for people of color.\n\nHowever, the key point is whether she was in the wrong for calling 911 based on her perception of danger at the time. If she genuinely felt threatened, her instinct to call for help is understandable. The backlash might be unfair if they're not considering her fear and the lack of information she had. But if her reaction was based on stereotypes or assumptions about race, then she might be in the wrong.\n\nShe mentions she didn't consider his race, but the critics are implying race played a role. It's hard to say for sure, but the fact that she didn't describe him and that the situation was genuinely confusing (he was at the wrong door) suggests it was a mistake based on fear, not malice. Also, the police found out it was a mistake, so there was no actual threat.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions were driven by fear for her safety in a dark, isolated situation. While the outcome was a misunderstanding, the initial response was a reasonable precaution given the circumstances. The backlash is harsh and may stem from valid concerns about racial bias, but that doesn't make her initial reaction wrong. She's caught in a difficult situation where both her fear and the societal issues are real but conflicting. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
