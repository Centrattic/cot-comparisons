I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man. The situation involves the author seeing a man at her window at 2 AM, which she found threatening. She called the police, and later found out he was supposed to meet someone else but got confused. Now she's facing backlash from classmates and others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her actions. She was alone, it was late at night, and someone was pressing against her window. Her immediate reaction was fear, and she took steps to protect herself\u2014screaming, locking herself in, calling 911. These are typical reactions in a perceived threat. The fact that she couldn't describe him because it was dark and she didn't get a good look adds to the uncertainty. \n\nThe backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism and overreaction. However, the police confirmed that the man was not there to harm her. The key here is whether her actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Self-defense and safety are primary concerns. The law doesn't require someone to wait until being harmed to call for help. \n\nOn the other hand, there's the social context of racial profiling. The author acknowledges that she recognizes the risks Black people face with the police, and she didn't make a comparison. But the critics are pointing out that her reaction might be part of a broader systemic issue where Black individuals are disproportionately affected by police contact. \n\nThe question is whether her actions were justified. Since she was in a state of fear and took actions to ensure her safety, which are legally and socially acceptable when feeling threatened, she's not in the wrong. However, it's also important to consider the social implications and the need for awareness about racial bias, even if unintentional. The author's not in the wrong for calling 911, but perhaps there's room for reflection and education on how such situations can be handled with more sensitivity. \n\nThe answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because her actions were driven by fear and a desire to ensure her safety, which is understandable. The backlash, while based on valid societal issues, doesn't negate her right to feel safe and seek help in a threatening situation.\n"
