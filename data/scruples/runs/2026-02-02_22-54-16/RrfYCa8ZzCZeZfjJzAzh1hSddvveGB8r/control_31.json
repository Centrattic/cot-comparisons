I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called 911 on a black man is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is a female college student who saw a man pressing against the window at 2 AM, said \"Let me in,\" which scared her. She screamed, locked herself in, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found him and it was a case of mistaken entry because the doors looked similar.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze both sides. \n\nFirst, her actions: She was in a vulnerable situation, alone at night, seen someone at her window. She didn't turn on lights to avoid waking her roommate but then made contact and he asked to enter. Her response was to call 911, which is the standard procedure for potential break-ins. The police handled it and found out he had a legitimate reason but made a mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, some people are accusing her of racism because of his race. But she mentions she didn't get a good look and would have called regardless of his race. However, the way she reacted without attempting to verify the situation might be seen as overreacting. The key points here are her fear for safety, the time of the incident, and the lack of immediate threat confirmation.\n\nBut then, considering that calling 911 is a reasonable response when someone is at your window saying \"Let me in\" at such a late hour, especially when she was alone. The police's conclusion indicates that her actions were a misunderstanding, not a malicious act. The backlash she's facing is harsh, comparing her to being racist, but she didn't make that comparison herself. \n\nThe user also asks if she's in the wrong for being upset about the backlash. Well, she did act in self-defense based on fear. The backlash might be contributing to the problem, given the context of racial bias in police interactions. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nHer actions were based on fear and a perceived threat. Even though the man was not a danger, the fact that she didn't confront him directly (since she didn't turn on the light) might be seen as not giving him a chance to explain. But considering the time and her being alone, it's understandable she didn't want to risk approaching him. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised to call the police if they feel threatened, regardless of the person's race. The issue here might be the assumption made without evidence, but the police were able to resolve it. The fact that the man didn't have a weapon and was just mistaken doesn't negate the fact that he was at her window uninvited. \n\nOn the flip side, the backlash could be part of a larger societal issue where any interaction with a black man by a white person is immediately seen as racist. But the user isn't claiming that she's not in the wrong for the backlash, just the initial call. \n\nSo, in terms of legal and safety procedures, calling 911 in such a scenario is justified. However, the accusations of racism might not be fair if she's not a person of color and had no way of knowing his race at that point. But the problem is that even if her intent wasn't racist, the action could be perceived as such, especially in a context where black men are disproportionately affected by police violence. \n\nBut according to the story, she didn't describe him well and was just scared. The police didn't confront him aggressively, and the outcome was a minor mistake. The backlash seems to be more about the perceived racial context, but the user didn't make that comparison. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, she acted on her fear and took steps to ensure her safety. The question is whether that's in the wrong. Since the police found that there was no criminal intent, but the action of calling 911 led to the man's arrest, maybe there's a part where she could have done something else. But given the situation, her actions were in self-defense. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she acted on her fear for safety and didn't have a way to know it was a mistake. The backlash is unwarranted, and she's not at fault for calling 911 to protect herself. However, there's a middle ground where she might be seen as overreacting, but given the context, it's a valid reaction.\n"
