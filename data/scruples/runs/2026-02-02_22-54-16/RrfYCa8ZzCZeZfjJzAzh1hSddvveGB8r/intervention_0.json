I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man. The situation is pretty specific, so I need to consider both sides carefully.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: She's a female college student who encountered a man at her window. It's 2 AM, dark, and she's alone with only one roommate asleep. She describes the man as \"pressed up against the window\" and making direct eye contact, saying \"Let me in.\" That's pretty scary in the middle of the night. Her immediate actions\u2014screaming, locking herself in, calling 911, and texting her roommate\u2014are all reactions someone in fear might have. The police found the man, who was actually looking for a friend and had been confused by the similar doors. The author didn't know his intentions and was too scared to interact directly. She also mentions she would have called 911 regardless of his race, which is important because it addresses the potential racial bias accusations.\n\nNow, the backlash: People are accusing her of racism, suggesting she didn't consider the man's perspective (like maybe he was lost or needed help) and that she overreacted. The key here is whether her actions were justified given the circumstances. She was alone, in her home, and in a situation where she felt threatened. The police report clarified the misunderstanding, but that doesn't change the fact that she acted based on fear and a perceived threat. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone feels their safety is in danger, calling 911 is appropriate. The man was outside, not inside the premises, but her fear of him being an intruder is understandable. However, the social context is tricky because of the racial overtones. The commenters are pointing out that Black individuals often face more severe police interactions, so calling the police on a Black person might be seen as more dangerous. The author didn't know his race when she called, but the reflection of his skin tone was visible. Still, she emphasizes she didn't interact with him and was too scared to do so. \n\nThe question is whether her reaction was a justified response to a perceived threat or if she should have considered other possibilities. There's a balance between personal safety and the potential for racial profiling. The author didn't make a comparison to race in her initial account, but the situation led others to interpret it that way. She also acknowledges that her actions could be seen as overreacting. \n\nOn one hand, she was in fear for her safety and acted to protect herself and her roommates. On the other, in hindsight, the man was actually a friend trying to find the right door. But the critical point is that she didn't have that information at the time. People often act based on their immediate perceptions, especially in fear. The backlash is harsh, but the author's intent wasn't to profile; she was reacting to a scary situation. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If we consider the intent and the context of fear, probably not. The police responded and resolved the situation without harm. The issue is more about the perception and the subsequent accusations, which are unfair if her actions were based on genuine fear, not race. But the backlash is a real problem, and the question also asks about being upset over that. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong for calling 911. Her actions were driven by self-preservation, and the misunderstanding was on the part of the man. The accusations of racism are misplaced here because she didn't act with malice but out of fear. However, the backlash is a consequence of the social context around race and policing, which is unfortunate but not her fault given the circumstances.\n"
