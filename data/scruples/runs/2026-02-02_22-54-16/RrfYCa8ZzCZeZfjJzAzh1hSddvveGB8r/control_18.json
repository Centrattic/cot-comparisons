I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a female college student who woke up at 2 AM, went to the kitchen, and saw a man pressed up against the window. He said \"Let me in.\" She was scared, screamed, locked herself in the closet, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found out he was a friend of someone in a similar-looking unit. Now, classmates are mocking her and accusing her of racism because the man was Black. They're saying she should have talked to him first, not called the police. The author is upset about the backlash and wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, her actions: She saw a man at her window at 2 AM. It was dark, she couldn't see well. She made eye contact, and he said to let him in. She was scared, which is understandable. She didn't know if he was a threat. She tried not to wake her roommate by turning on the light. Her reaction was to call 911. That's a safety measure. But the person was a friend who got confused. So in hindsight, maybe it was a mistake. But at the time, she didn't have that information.\n\nThe backlash is that people are accusing her of racism. The issue here is the racial aspect. If she had called the police on a white person in the same situation, would it have been the same reaction? Probably not. So there's a double standard. The problem is that her fear led her to call the police on a Black man, which can be dangerous given systemic issues with police and Black individuals. But was she in the wrong for doing so in her moment of fear?\n\nOn one hand, her safety is important. She had a right to feel scared and take precautions. On the other hand, calling the police on someone without knowing their intentions, especially when it's a case of mistaken identity, can contribute to racial profiling. The question is whether her action was justified. Since she couldn't see him well and he was at the window, it's plausible she thought it was a break-in. But the fact that the man was Black is making people see it as a racial issue. \n\nThe author isn't claiming she's not at fault for overreacting. She acknowledges that maybe calling the police was an overreaction. But she also points out that the backlash is harsh and that she's being accused of racism, which she didn't intend. The key is whether her action was wrong. In terms of immediate safety, she might not be in the wrong because she felt threatened. However, the way the situation unfolded, with the racial implications, complicates it. \n\nSo, in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the answer might hinge on intent and context. She didn't have intent to be racist, but her action, regardless of intent, could be seen as contributing to a problem. But in the moment, her reaction was based on fear. The police were called, and it turned out to be a misunderstanding. So, she's not in the wrong for acting out of fear for her safety, but she might be in the wrong for not considering that her actions could lead to a harmful situation for the other person. However, given the information she had at the time, she might not be entirely at fault. \n\nThe community often looks at these cases and sometimes the person who calls the police is criticized, especially if the person called on is Black. But the person's safety is a primary concern. In this case, the police responded and there was no harm done. So, maybe she's not in the wrong, but she could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. \n\nThe answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because she acted out of fear for her safety. However, in the broader context of racial dynamics, her action could be seen as problematic. But in the specific situation, she's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
