I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a woman who saw a man pressed up against her window at 2 AM, said \"Let me in,\" which terrified her. She screamed, locked herself in, and called 911. The police later found out the man was supposed to meet a friend but got confused. Now she's facing backlash for her actions.\n\nThe key points here are her fear and the situation. At 2 AM, someone at her window, making eye contact and saying \"Let me in\"\u2014that's a terrifying scenario. She didn't know if the window was locked or if there were others. Her immediate reaction was to protect herself, which is natural. \n\nBut she's being accused of racism because he was Black. The question is whether her actions were wrong. Legally, if someone is in a suspicious situation and they feel threatened, calling the police is a standard response. The police did show up and resolved the situation without harm. The person wasn't violent, just a misunderstanding.\n\nHowever, there's a social aspect here. The backlash she's facing is partly due to systemic issues where Black people are disproportionately affected by police interactions. Her friends and others are pointing out that her reaction might have been influenced by racial bias, even if she didn't intend it. She acknowledges that herself when she says she can see how it might be seen as overreacting.\n\nThe dilemma is whether her fear was justified. In ambiguous situations, people act on instinct. She couldn't see him clearly, and the police didn't find any weapons. But she also didn't confront him directly. Some might argue that she should have tried to communicate first, but in a situation where she felt immediate danger, calling 911 is a reasonable action.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, she's probably not. From a social justice perspective, some might argue that her reaction contributes to racial profiling. But the author doesn't claim to have acted based on race; she emphasizes that fear was the primary driver.\n\nThe answer might hinge on intent and the balance between personal safety and societal impact. Since she acted out of fear and not malice, and the police resolved the situation without harm, it's debatable. However, considering the societal context and the potential for racial bias, even if unintended, there's a case to be made that her actions could be seen as problematic. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nGiven that she didn't act maliciously and was in a scary situation, maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong. But if the backlash is valid because of the broader implications of calling police on Black people, then maybe there's some responsibility. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which implies moral fault. The author isn't denying her fear was justified, and the police response was appropriate. So, perhaps the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
