I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The situation is a bit complex because it involves both the person's safety concerns and the potential for racial bias.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a female college student who saw a man pressing against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called 911. The police found out the man was supposed to meet a friend but got confused. Now, her classmates are accusing her of racism.\n\nThe key points here are: she was in a vulnerable situation (alone, at night), she perceived an immediate threat (a man at the window saying \"Let me in\"), and she acted out of fear. However, the man didn't have a weapon or threaten her, and he was outside. The backlash she's facing includes accusations of racial profiling because he was black.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author's fear could be justified in a situation where someone is at her window uninvited. On the other hand, calling 911 based on the color of someone's skin without clear evidence of a crime could contribute to racial profiling. The police report indicated there was no malicious intent from the man, which might lead some to view the call as an overreaction.\n\nThe author also acknowledges that people of color face greater risks with police interactions. She didn't describe the man, which suggests she didn't have a clear view, so her reaction might have been based on assumptions. However, she was in a state of panic, which affects judgment.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Some might argue that self-preservation is natural and that she wasn't obligated to confront the situation alone. Others might see it as a case of racial bias, given the statistics on how people of color are treated by law enforcement. The backlash she's experiencing is part of the context, but the original question is about her action of calling 911.\n\nI should also consider legal aspects. In many cases, calling 911 when someone is on your property in a suspicious manner is not illegal. The man was outside, so she had the right to feel unsafe. However, the racial component complicates things because of systemic issues. The police's explanation that he was mistaken in entering the wrong unit might mean there was no intent to harm, but she didn't know that at the time.\n\nIn summary, the author acted out of fear for her safety, but the man ended up being non-threatening. The accusations against her might be about the broader societal context of racial profiling. The answer isn't black and white (pun intended). However, the question asks if she's in the wrong. If we focus solely on her actions in the moment, she was in a frightening situation and called for help, which is a standard response. The backlash might be unfair, but her action isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong. However, if the question is about whether her actions were racially motivated, that's a different angle. But the user's question is about being in the wrong generally.\n"
