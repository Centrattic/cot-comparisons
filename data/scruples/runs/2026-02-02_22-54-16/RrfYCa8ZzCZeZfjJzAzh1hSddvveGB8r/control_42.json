I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man. The situation is a bit complex because it involves both personal safety and potential racial bias.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is alone in her apartment, wakes up in the middle of the night, sees a man pressing up against her window. She's scared, screams, locks herself in, and calls the police. She didn't get a good look at him because it was dark. The police found out it was a mistake\u2014he was supposed to go to a different apartment. \n\nNow, the backlash she's getting from classmates and others is accusing her of racism. They're saying she should have just talked to him instead of calling 911. But the key here is that she was in a situation where she felt threatened. Her reaction was based on fear for her safety, not race. She explicitly says she would have called regardless of the man's race. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a valid concern about the over-policing of Black individuals and the danger they face when interacting with police. The question is whether her actions were an overreaction. Since she couldn't see the man clearly and was in a vulnerable situation, her instinct to call for help is understandable. But some might argue that in hindsight, it was unnecessary. \n\nThe author is also being blamed for not being more cautious, like asking what he wanted first. However, in a real fear scenario, people don't always act rationally. The police did end up resolving the situation without harm to either party. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She did what she thought was necessary to protect herself. While the backlash might be unfair, her actions could be seen as a reasonable response to fear. The key points are her fear of potential danger and the fact that she didn't have enough information. However, there's also a societal issue where such calls can lead to harm for others, so there's a balance here. \n\nI think the answer would be that she's not in the wrong because her primary concern was her safety, and she didn't have the context to know it was a mistake. The backlash is more about the broader issue rather than her individual action. So, answer B.\n"
