I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a female college student called 911 because she saw a black man pressing against her window, said \"Let me in,\" and she was scared. The police found out he was supposed to go to a different apartment but got confused. Now, her classmates are accusing her of racism and she's upset about the backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her actions were wrong. She was in a vulnerable situation, alone at night, and perceived a threat. She didn't know if the window was locked or if there were others. She tried to stay quiet to not wake her roommate, then screamed and called 911. Her fear led her to take protective measures. \n\nIn such situations, people often act based on their perception of danger. While it's true that the man was not a threat and there's a concern about racial profiling, the key point is whether her reaction was justified. She couldn't see him well, couldn't confirm his intentions, and was in a state of panic. \n\nOn the other hand, critics are pointing out that she didn't try to communicate first. However, in a moment of fear, it's natural to prioritize safety. The question is whether calling the police was an overreaction. Since he was at the wrong apartment and didn't enter, maybe she could have approached differently, but that's hindsight. \n\nAlso, the backlash she's facing is significant, and some of the comments are harsh. The user is asking if she's in the wrong both for calling 911 and for being upset about the backlash. \n\nConsidering that she didn't know his intentions and acted out of fear, it's debatable. But the fact that she's a woman in a potentially dangerous situation might justify her actions. The problem is the racial aspect\u2014calling the police on a black man can have serious consequences, so there's a valid concern about how such actions contribute to systemic issues. \n\nHowever, the author didn't mention race as a factor in her decision. She emphasized her fear and the circumstances. While she might have overreacted, it's not necessarily malicious. The backlash might be partly due to the racial context, but she didn't intend to target him based on race. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tricky case. On one hand, her actions were based on fear and a perceived threat. On the other, it's important to be cautious about racial profiling. The answer might depend on whether her actions were reasonable given the situation. Since she was alone, scared, and couldn't verify his intentions, many might say she's not in the wrong. But others might argue that she should have tried to communicate first. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong. Her actions were a response to fear and a perceived threat. While there's room for reflection on overreaction, it's not clear that she was wrong. The backlash might be harsh, but her primary concern was safety.\n"
