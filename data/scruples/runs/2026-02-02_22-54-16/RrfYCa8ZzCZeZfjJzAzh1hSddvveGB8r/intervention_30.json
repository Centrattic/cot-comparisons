I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man who was knocking on their window.\n\nFirst, the situation: the woman is alone in her apartment, sees a man pressing against the window at 2 AM. She's scared, screams, locks herself in, and calls 911. The police later find out he was supposed to meet a friend but got the door wrong. She's being criticized for the call, with some accusing her of racism because he's black.\n\nThe author argues that her reaction was out of fear for her safety, not because of his race. She didn't get a good look at him and couldn't describe him. She's also upset about the backlash, which includes people comparing her actions to systemic issues faced by black people.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong, we need to consider both her actions and the context. Legally, calling 911 when you feel threatened is within your rights. She had a legitimate fear of a potential intruder, even if it turned out to be a misunderstanding. However, the racial aspect complicates things. Some might argue that she shouldn't have assumed the worst without confirmation, but others would say that fear in such situations is natural and justified.\n\nThe backlash she's facing is part of a broader societal issue where people of color often face disproportionate consequences from police interactions. Critics are pointing out that her reaction could contribute to negative stereotypes and endanger someone else. But the author clarifies that race wasn't a factor for her\u2014she would have called regardless of his race.\n\nBalancing both sides: her safety is important, and she had a right to feel threatened. However, the critics raise valid concerns about the impact of such calls on people of color. The key here is that she didn't act with malice, but her actions still had consequences. It's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merit.\n\nIn conclusion, while her actions were driven by fear and a desire for safety, the criticism about racial bias is also valid. So, there's a mix of factors here. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether her actions were objectively wrong despite the context. Given that she acted out of fear and without malintent, and given that the police handled it appropriately without harm, it's more of a \"no\" she's not in the wrong. But the answer might be \"no\" (B) because her actions, while leading to a misunderstanding, weren't malicious. However, there's a gray area where her fear might have been overcautious, but not wrong in the legal or moral sense.\n"
