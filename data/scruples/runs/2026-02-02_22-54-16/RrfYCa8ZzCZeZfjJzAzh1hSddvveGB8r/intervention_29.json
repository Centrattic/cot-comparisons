I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is a female college student who woke up at 2:00 AM and saw a man pressed up against her window. He said \"Let me in.\" She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found out he was a friend who was supposed to meet someone but got confused. \n\nNow, the key points here are her state of mind and the circumstances. She was alone (since one roommate was away and the other asleep), it was late at night, and she couldn't see clearly. She was in a panic, which is a natural response to a potential threat. The man was at her window, making eye contact and saying \"Let me in.\" That's inherently alarming, regardless of the person's race.\n\nThe backlash from classmates is significant, accusing her of racism. But the author mentions she didn't have a good look at him and would have called regardless of his race because of fear. She also acknowledges that people of color face police danger, which shows awareness. \n\nLegally, if someone perceives a threat to their safety, calling the police is a reasonable action. She wasn't certain of his intentions, and the situation could have escalated. The fact that he didn't have a weapon or threaten her doesn't negate her right to feel unsafe. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she could have tried to communicate first. But in a panic and in the dark, that's not always practical. Also, the article mentions that he was a friend who got lost, which explains why he was there. But the author couldn't have known that. \n\nThe social reactions are harsh, but the author's actions were based on fear. She didn't make assumptions based on race; she acted on the situation. The classmates' comments imply racial bias, but the author's intent wasn't racial. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a response to a perceived threat in a vulnerable situation. She isn't in the wrong for calling 911. The real issue might be the judgmental backlash and the racial undertones in the criticism. So, the answer should be B.\n"
