I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a college student calling 911 on a Black man who was at her window. The key points here are the context of the call, the reasons behind it, and the subsequent backlash.\n\nFirst, the author was alone in her house at 2 AM. She saw a man at the window, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in.\" She was scared and didn't know if the window was locked or if there were others. Her immediate reaction was to scream, lock herself in the closet, and call 911. The police found him, and it turned out he was supposed to meet a friend but got confused because the doors looked similar. \n\nNow, considering the justification for calling 911. In many jurisdictions, you can call emergency services if you feel threatened, even if it turns out to be a mistake. The author was in a vulnerable position: it was late, she was alone, and she couldn't see clearly. Her fear was real, even if the situation was misinterpreted. The police confirmed there was no weapon, but that doesn't negate her fear at the time.\n\nThe backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism. However, the problem here is that the people accusing her are making assumptions about her intentions based on his race. The author clarified she would have called regardless of the person's race. The issue is that her fear led her to call 911, but it's important to balance that with the real dangers that marginalized communities face when interacting with police. \n\nBut the question is, is she in the wrong? Legally, she might not be; she acted out of fear for her safety. However, some might argue that she should have tried to identify him first. But in a high-stress, isolated situation, it's understandable that she didn't. The backlash is also problematic because it's invalidating her fear without considering her context. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether her actions, while perhaps an overreaction in hindsight, were reasonable given the circumstances. Since she acted to protect herself and there's no indication of malicious intent towards the man, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for calling 911. The backlash is misguided, but the original action was a response to perceived threat. Therefore, likely answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
