I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she called 911 because she saw a man pressing against her window at 2 AM, which made her scared. The man turned out to be someone who was supposed to visit a friend in a similar-looking unit. Now, people are criticizing her for calling the police, especially since the man was Black, and she's facing backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She was alone, in the middle of the night, and saw someone at her window. She was scared enough to scream, lock herself in, and call 911. That's a natural fear response. She couldn't see him well, didn't know if he was a threat, and couldn't describe him. So her reaction might be justified from her standpoint.\n\nOn the other hand, the man wasn't in her home, didn't have a weapon, and was actually just mistaken. The police resolved it without incident. The critics are pointing out that she could have approached the situation differently, like talking to him first or waiting. But in a high-stress, fearful situation, people might not think rationally. Also, the racial aspect is a big factor here. The question of whether race influenced her decision is part of the backlash. She mentions she wouldn't have called based on race, but others are accusing her of racism. However, she didn't make assumptions beyond the situation\u2014she just saw a potential intruder.\n\nThe author is also upset about the backlash. She acknowledges the systemic issues with police and race but is hurt by the accusations. Her friends are pointing out that her experience is minor compared to what Black people face. So there's a conflict between her right to feel safe and the societal context of racial profiling.\n\nIn legal terms, calling 911 when you feel threatened is generally acceptable. The police's role is to respond to potential threats. Even if it was a mistake, if someone believes they are in danger, they have the right to seek help. However, the backlash is about the social implications of calling police on a Black person, which can be seen as contributing to racial tensions. But the author didn't know his race at the time; she was focused on the immediate threat.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. From a self-defense and safety standpoint, she's not wrong for acting on fear. But from a social justice perspective, the incident highlights how even well-meaning actions can contribute to systemic issues. However, the key here is that she acted out of fear, not malice or racial intent. The police handled it, and there were no injuries. The backlash might stem from a place of trying to prevent racial profiling, but her intent wasn't to target based on race. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for calling 911. The answer should be B.\n"
