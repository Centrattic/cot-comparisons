I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man who was outside their window. \n\nFirst, the situation: The woman saw a man pressed against her window at 2:00 AM, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in.\" She panicked, screamed, locked herself in the closet, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found out the man was supposed to let a friend into the wrong apartment.\n\nNow, considering the context. She was alone (one roommate away, another asleep) and felt threatened. Her reaction was fear-driven\u2014screaming, locking herself in, calling 911. She didn't have a good look at him because it was dark. The backlash from classmates is questioning her decision, implying racism, and comparing it to systemic issues. She acknowledges the potential overreaction but also the real danger of police interactions for Black people.\n\nKey points: The woman acted out of fear for her safety. She didn't confront the man or accuse him of anything; she called for help. The man wasn't inside her home and hadn't used violence. However, the situation could have been handled differently\u2014maybe by trying to talk or check if the door was unlocked first. But given the time, the element of surprise, and the potential risk, her actions might be seen as a natural reaction.\n\nLegal perspective: In many places, if someone is outside a home and perceived as a threat, calling police is within a person's rights. However, the perception here might be influenced by racial biases, even if unintentional. The author claims she would have called regardless of the man's race, but the backlash suggests that the race was a factor in others' judgments.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between self-defense and the societal impact of calling police on a Black person. The author didn't claim the man was a criminal; she just felt threatened. The backlash's accusations of racism might be valid if her reaction was based on stereotypes, but she states she acted out of fear, not prejudice.\n\nConclusion: The author's actions were driven by fear of an immediate threat. While there's a valid argument about the potential overreaction and the societal context of policing, her primary intent was self-protection. The question is whether her actions, while understandable, were wrong. Since she didn't have malicious intent and acted in a moment of panic, it's debatable. However, given the circumstances and the lack of malicious intent, the answer leans towards \"No,\" she's not in the wrong.\n"
