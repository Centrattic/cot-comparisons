I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man after seeing him at their window. The situation involves fear and a potential break-in. The author was scared, locked themselves in, and called the police. The backlash they received includes accusations of racism and overreaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was alone at night, saw a man pressed against their window, and he said \"Let me in.\" That's a scary situation. The immediate reaction of calling 911 is a natural response to fear for one's safety. The police clarified that the man was supposed to meet a friend but got confused. So, the author's actions were based on fear and lack of information.\n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is using this incident to highlight racial profiling. The question is whether the author's reaction was justified. The key here is that the author didn't have a good look at the man and was unsure if he was a threat. The color of his skin wasn't the factor; the situation (a stranger at the window at 2 AM) was the trigger. However, the fact that the person is Black and the accusations of racism are valid because there's a history of racial bias in these situations.\n\nThe author acknowledges that they didn't act out of race but out of fear. However, in society's current climate, calling the police on a Black person without clear evidence can be seen as contributing to systemic issues, even if unintended. The author might not be in the wrong for their immediate fear response, but the backlash is pointing out that such actions can perpetuate racial tensions and mistrust.\n\nSo, the dilemma here is balancing personal safety and societal context. The author's actions were self-protective, which is understandable, but the consequences (accusations of racism) are real. The answer hinges on whether the intent was racist. Since the author didn't act based on race but on the situation, they might not be in the wrong. However, the impact is significant. The debate is between individual fear responses and the broader societal implications. Given that the author didn't intend malice and was in a scary situation, the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong. But there's a nuance here where the action, even if not malicious, contributes to a larger issue. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
