I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man under the circumstances described.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is a female college student who saw a man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called 911. The police found out it was a mistake\u2014his friend was supposed to unlock the door, but he got confused. Now, people are criticizing her for being racist.\n\nThe key points here are her state of fear, the time of night, and the fact that she couldn't see the man clearly. She couldn't determine his intentions and was in a vulnerable situation. The backlash is accusing her of racism, but she emphasizes that she didn't have time to assess the situation beyond immediate fear for her safety.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. On one hand, calling 911 when someone is near your window in the middle of the night is a reasonable reaction to a potential threat, especially when you're alone and scared. On the other hand, the racial implications and the fact that it turned out to be a mistake might lead some to view her reaction as overzealous, especially given societal tensions around racial profiling.\n\nHowever, the author didn't act out of malice or intent to harm. She was in a state of panic and didn't have information to assess the situation beyond her fear. The police response clarified that there was no malice from the man, but her action was based on self-preservation.\n\nAlso, the backlash she's facing is harsh, with people making comparisons to racism and suggesting she targeted him because he was Black. She clarifies she wouldn't have called 911 based on race alone, and the situation's context (his attempt to enter her home) was the main factor.\n\nIn such cases, the legal and social expectations might differ. Legally, she might be justified in reporting a potential intrusion. Socially, the sensitivity to racial issues is important, but she didn't act with intent to discriminate. The question is whether her action constitutes being in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions were driven by fear for her safety in a dangerous situation. She didn't have the luxury of time to discern the man's intentions beyond his presence near her window. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for calling 911. However, the backlash might stem from valid concerns about racial profiling, but the author's intent and the circumstances are crucial here.\n"
