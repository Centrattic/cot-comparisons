I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The situation is that the woman saw a man at her window at night, was scared, and called the police. The police explained that the man had gotten confused and was supposed to go to another door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. She was alone, in the middle of the night, and saw someone pressed against her window. Her reaction was fear and panic, leading her to call 911. She didn't know if the window was locked or if there were others. She screamed, locked herself in, and texted her roommate. Those are all defensive actions someone might take in a scary situation.\n\nThe backlash she's facing is part of the question too. People are accusing her of racism and saying she overreacted. But the author acknowledges that she didn't act because of the man's race and recognizes the systemic issues. However, she's also being criticized for not talking to him first. \n\nIn many places, the law is that you can call the police if you feel threatened, even if it turns out to be a misunderstanding. The key here is her fear for her safety. The man didn't enter her home or use a weapon, but the context of a stranger at night can be terrifying. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a valid concern about the disproportionate impact of calling police on Black individuals, given historical and current police violence. But the woman didn't know his race\u2014she didn't get a good look\u2014and she emphasized she would have called regardless. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tricky balance. Her actions were a response to fear for her safety, which is understandable. However, the backlash she's facing also raises important points about how such situations affect marginalized communities. The question is whether her actions were justified. Since she acted out of fear and not with malice, and the police found it was a misunderstanding, it's not clear she was in the wrong. But there's also a responsibility to consider alternative actions. However, in a crisis, people react instinctively. The answer likely leans towards B (No), because her reaction was based on self-preservation and she didn't have intent to discriminate.\n"
