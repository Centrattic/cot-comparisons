I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man. The situation involves the woman seeing a man pressed against her window in the middle of the night, making her scared, and then calling the police. The police found out that the man was a friend who got confused. Now she's getting accused of racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She was alone, in the middle of the night, saw someone at her window. She felt threatened, so she called 911 as a safety measure. That seems like a natural response to fear. She didn't know if he was a threat, and she locked herself in, screamed, which are all signs of someone genuinely scared.\n\nOn the other side, the backlash is about racial profiling. The man is Black, and people are suggesting she called the cops just because he was Black. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key here is intent and the circumstances. She didn't see his face, he was at her window, which is a potential security risk. In the dark, not knowing what's going on, calling the police could be seen as a reasonable action, especially if she felt her safety was at risk.\n\nBut then again, after the fact, people are pointing out that she didn't try to communicate first. The police found out it was a misunderstanding. So maybe she could have approached it differently, like asking who it was before calling. However, in a panic and fear, people might not think to do that. Also, she mentions she screamed and locked herself in, which is more about self-preservation.\n\nThe other angle is the societal context. There's a valid concern about racial bias in calling the police. If this were a white person, maybe the reaction wouldn't be the same. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she acted out of fear without malice, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she was racially motivated, then yes. She says she would have called regardless of his race, which she can't see because it was dark. So her intent wasn't racial, based on her account.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: her fear and self-defense vs. the impact on him and potential racial profiling. The police resolved it, and she admitted she overreacted but didn't mean to. The answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong, because her action was based on fear for her safety, not malice or racism. However, there's room for understanding the other side's perspective, but the question is about her being in the wrong in the situation.\n"
