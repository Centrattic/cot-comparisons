I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a female college student who called 911 because she saw a black man pressing against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, didn't turn on the light to avoid waking her roommate, and ended up locking herself in the closet. The police found out the man had a friend who was expecting him and he was supposed to let himself in using a similar-looking door.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. First, her actions: she called 911 because she felt threatened. She was in a scary situation, and her instinct was to call for help. The man wasn't in her home, but she was in fear for her safety, which is a valid reason to call the police. On the other hand, some people are criticizing her for not trying to communicate first or for making assumptions based on the man's race. \n\nNow, considering the context. The police found out the man didn't have malicious intent, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to react the way she did. People often act on fear, especially in the middle of the night when they're alone. The fact that she couldn't describe the man and that it was dark suggests she didn't have much information. \n\nThe backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism, which is a serious issue. However, her intent wasn't to discriminate; she was scared. The key here is whether her response was reasonable given the circumstances. If someone is in fear of their safety and calls the police, that's a legitimate action. The problem arises when the reaction is based on racial profiling without any other evidence. But in this case, the author says she would have called regardless of his race, so her race wasn't the factor. \n\nAlso, she's acknowledging the potential overreaction and the real dangers people of color face with police. That shows she's aware of the complexities. The other side is that calling the police in a situation where there's no immediate threat can be seen as overstepping, but this was a situation where she perceived a threat. \n\nSo, weighing the fear for her safety against the potential harm to the other person. If she had a reasonable fear, then her actions are justifiable. The fact that the man was indeed trying to get in (albeit by accident) might mean her fear was somewhat valid, even if the outcome wasn't as dangerous as she thought. \n\nIn terms of the backlash, people have the right to express their opinions, but the author isn't in the wrong if her actions were based on fear and not racial bias. The key point is whether her reaction was an overreaction due to racial stereotypes. Since she claims she would have called regardless of race, and the situation did involve a man breaking into a home (even if accidentally), her actions might be seen as justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
