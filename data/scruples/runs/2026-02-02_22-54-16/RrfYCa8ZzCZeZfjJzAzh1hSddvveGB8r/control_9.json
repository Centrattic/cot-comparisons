I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man and the subsequent backlash. So first, the situation: the author is a female college student who sees a man pressed against her window at 2 AM. She's scared, screams, locks herself in, calls 911. The police later say it was a friend who got the wrong door. Now, she's facing criticism that she's racist for calling the police.\n\nThe key points here are her intent and the circumstances. She claims she was scared and didn't wait to talk because she couldn't risk her safety. The man didn't have a weapon, but the situation at 2 AM with someone at the window is inherently alarming. She didn't know his race when she called; others are projecting that the color of his skin influenced her decision, but she argues she would have called regardless. \n\nNow, considering the legal and societal context. In many places, the law encourages people to call authorities if they feel threatened. She acted in self-defense, which is generally acceptable. However, there's a societal issue where calling the police on Black individuals can lead to disproportionate force, which some people emphasize. The backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism, which is a valid concern given systemic issues. \n\nShe also acknowledges the potential for overreaction and the different dangers people of color face with police. Her friends validate that she shouldn't compare her experience to theirs. The question is whether her action was wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether her fear was reasonable. At 2 AM, someone at the window pressing against it saying \"Let me in\" is a valid reason to call 911, especially when she couldn't confirm if others were involved or if she was in danger. The police did find the man, so the call was effective. However, the backlash is also highlighting the racialized context of calling police on Black people. \n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since her action was based on fear for her safety and she didn't know the man's race at the time, she might not be in the wrong. However, the criticism from others is also valid because of systemic issues. But the user is asking if the author is wrong. \n\nGiven that, the answer would be B (No), as she acted out of fear for her safety and the situation was objectively concerning. The backlash is about broader societal issues, but her individual action wasn't wrong.\n"
