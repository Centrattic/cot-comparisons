I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a female college student called 911 because she saw a Black man pressed up against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called the police. The police found the man, who was supposed to go to a different apartment but got confused. Now, her classmates are calling her names and accusing her of racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She was alone at night, saw someone at her window, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in.\" That's pretty scary. She didn't know if the window was locked or if there were others. Her reaction was to call 911, which is a natural response to a potential break-in or threat. She wasn't able to see him clearly, and she was in a state of panic. \n\nOn the other side, the man was Black, and some people are criticizing her for calling the police based on his race. They're saying she should have waited or talked to him first. There's a valid point about racial profiling and the dangers Black people face with the police. But the author says she would have called regardless of his race because she was scared. \n\nNow, the question is whether she was wrong to call 911. From a safety standpoint, if someone is at your window saying \"Let me in\" at 2 AM, it's reasonable to be concerned. The police arrived and resolved the situation without incident. The man wasn't armed, but that's after the fact. In the moment, she had to act on her fear. \n\nHowever, the backlash is about the perception of racism. Even if she didn't intend to be racist, the action could be seen as contributing to racial profiling. The key here is that the author did not know the man's race at the time; she was in the dark and in fear. The color of his skin wasn't the reason for the call, based on her account. The criticism is that she didn't consider the man's intent, but in a panic, people don't always process information rationally.\n\nThe author also acknowledges that people of color have it harder with the police, so she's not dismissing those issues. She's confused why her fear and reaction are being criticized so harshly. The question is whether her action was wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the law allows people to call the police when they feel threatened. Even if it was a misunderstanding, her safety is important. The wrong here might be more about the perception and the subsequent backlash rather than the act of calling 911 itself. So, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong for calling 911, but the situation highlights a larger issue of how such actions are perceived in a racially charged context. The backlash is hurtful, but the act of calling 911 was a response to a perceived threat, which is a person's right.\n"
