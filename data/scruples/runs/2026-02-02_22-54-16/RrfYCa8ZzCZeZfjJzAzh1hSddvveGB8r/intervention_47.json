I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a female college student who saw a man pressing against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, screamed, locked herself in the closet, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found the man, who was supposed to be let in by a friend but got confused.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she was wrong to call 911. The key points here are her state of fear and the circumstances. At 2 AM, a man appearing at the window, making eye contact, and saying \"Let me in\" would be alarming for anyone. The author didn't have time to assess the situation fully; she was in panic mode. Also, she couldn't see clearly because she didn't turn on the light, and she didn't know if he was alone or if others might be present.\n\nThe backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism. However, she mentions that she didn't get a good look at him and that she would have called regardless of his race. That's important because her action was based on fear for her safety, not a racial profile. The police confirmed the man was there by mistake, but the author had no way of knowing that at the time.\n\nOn the flip side, some argue that she overreacted by not trying to communicate first. But in a high-stress, fear-inducing situation, especially in the middle of the night, it's reasonable for her to prioritize safety. People's first instinct in such scenarios is often to call for help immediately rather than engage.\n\nThe fact that close friends acknowledged the systemic issues faced by Black people doesn't negate the author's fear. She didn't make a comparison but is now facing social consequences because of misunderstandings. Her intention was to protect herself, not to harm anyone. The police response was appropriate as they found the man and clarified the situation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were driven by self-preservation. While some might see it as an overreaction, given the context, she isn't in the wrong. The backlash seems to be based on assumptions rather than understanding her fear. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
