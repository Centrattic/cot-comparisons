I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a college student who wakes up at 2 AM, goes to the kitchen, sees a man pressed against the window. They make eye contact, he says \"Let me in,\" which scares her. She screams, locks herself in the closet, calls 911, texts her roommate. The police find the man; he was supposed to meet a friend but got the wrong door. Now, classmates are mocking her as \"Break in Barbie,\" accusing her of racism for calling the police on a black man.\n\nThe author is being criticized for not talking to the man first or waiting, and people are linking her action to racism. She's also hurt by the backlash and is seeking validation.\n\nFrom her perspective, she was scared and acting in self-defense. She couldn't see him clearly, didn't know if he was a threat, and the situation was late at night, isolated. She called the police out of fear, not malice. The police response shows it was a misunderstanding. She didn't recognize him as someone needing help but was in panic mode.\n\nOn the other hand, critics argue that calling 911 based on race is problematic, especially since it turned out to be a mistake. They mention the real risks black people face with police, so the call could be seen as contributing to unnecessary police encounters. The author herself acknowledges this and doesn't compare her experience to racial issues.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, in terms of legal and safety concerns, she had a legitimate fear for her safety. The police handled it, and it was a misunderstanding. However, the backlash is pointing out that her reaction, while based on fear, might inadvertently contribute to racial profiling. The question is whether her actions were wrong given her state of mind.\n\nLegally, she can call 911 if she feels threatened. She didn't know his intentions, and the situation could have escalated. But socially, there's a debate about the implications of calling police on people of color without clear threats. She's not denying the potential impact but is also justified in her fear.\n\nHer being upset about the backlash is understandable. She's facing social repercussions and being accused of racism, which is tough. However, she's reflecting on her actions and acknowledging possible overreaction. That shows she's not in denial.\n\nIn conclusion, while her call to 911 was based on fear and a possible threat, the backlash highlights the complex issue of racial bias in policing. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she acted out of self-preservation, but the situation underscores the need for awareness of how such actions can affect others. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) considering her intent and the circumstances, but with an understanding of the social context.\n"
