I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man based on the situation she described. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: She's a female college student who wakes up at 2 AM, goes to the kitchen, sees a man pressing against her window. They make eye contact, he says \"Let me in,\" she panics, screams, locks herself in the closet, calls 911, texts her roommate. The police found the guy; his friend was expecting him to unlock the door, but he got confused because the doors looked similar. \n\nNow, the backlash she's getting from classmates and others. They're accusing her of racism, saying she should have talked to him first, not called 911. The main question is whether she was wrong to call the police in that situation.\n\nLet me consider both sides. From her perspective, she was alone, in the middle of the night, seeing someone at her window who said \"Let me in.\" She was scared, in panic mode, couldn't see clearly (it was dark), and didn't know if the window was locked or if there were others. Her safety is a priority. In a high-stress situation like that, someone might act out of fear, not wanting to take chances. She didn't get a good look at him, so couldn't describe him. She called 911 because she felt threatened.\n\nOn the other side, the backlash comes from the idea that she assumed the worst without knowing. The man was actually supposed to be there, just got confused. The fact that people are questioning her based on his race is a point she mentions. She's being told that she shouldn't have called the police because he's black, and that if he were white, maybe she wouldn't have. That touches on real issues about racial profiling and how people of color interact with law enforcement. \n\nThe key here is the concept of \"reasonable fear.\" In many legal contexts, if someone feels their safety is in danger, calling the police is a reasonable action. However, the situation is that the man wasn't inside, didn't have a weapon, and it turned out to be a misunderstanding. But from her point of view, she couldn't know that at the time. People are criticizing her for not assuming he was harmless, but she had no way of knowing. \n\nAlso, the aspect of her being a woman and facing a potential intruder at night adds context. Women are often taught to take precautions in such situations, which might justify her reaction. \n\nThe backlash is hurtful, and she's being accused of racism, which she doesn't claim to be doing. She acknowledges that people of color have different experiences with police, and she's not equating her situation with theirs. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she acted out of fear for her safety, and given the circumstances (middle of the night, someone at the window, saying \"Let me in\"), then her reaction could be seen as a justified self-defense measure. However, some might argue that she could have tried to verify the situation first, like checking if the window was locked, or calling a neighbor instead of 911. But in her panic, she might not have thought of those steps. \n\nThe police did find the man and it was a mistake, but that doesn't necessarily mean she was wrong to call. The question is whether her action was reasonable. Since she had no way of knowing it was a mistake, and given the potential danger, her call might be seen as within her right. However, the backlash is highlighting the broader societal issues of racial bias and how calling the police on people of color can lead to negative outcomes. \n\nSo, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" maybe not. She's not at fault for acting in self-defense. The people criticizing her might be projecting their own biases about race onto her actions. However, the situation is complex because of the racial component. She might not be in the wrong for her initial reaction, but the backlash is also about awareness of systemic issues. \n\nI think the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong (B) because she acted out of fear for her safety in a scary situation. But it's a nuanced issue where both perspectives have valid points. The key is that she had a legitimate reason to feel threatened, even if it turned out to be a misunderstanding.\n"
