I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man as described in the situation. Let me start by breaking down the key points of the situation.\n\nThe author is a female college student who wakes up, goes into the kitchen, and sees a man pressed against her window. He says, \"Let me in.\" She's scared, screams, locks herself in the closet, calls 911, and texts her roommate. The police later find out that the man was supposed to meet a friend but got confused because the doors look similar. Classmates are criticizing her for assuming it was a break-in, calling her names like \"Break in Barbie,\" and accusing her of racism. She's also being told that if the man were white, she wouldn't have called the police. She's hurt by the backlash and is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the safety of the individual. When someone is in a situation where they feel threatened, especially in their home, calling 911 is a natural response. The author was scared and didn't know if the man was a threat. She didn't have time to assess the situation calmly because she was in panic mode. The fact that she couldn't see clearly and the man was saying \"Let me in\" would be alarming for anyone. \n\nHowever, there's the other side of the situation. The man wasn't breaking in, he was just at the wrong door. The author didn't have a clear reason to suspect him beyond his presence at the window. Critics are pointing out that she didn't try to talk to him first or wait to see if he left. They're suggesting that her reaction might be influenced by racial bias because the man was black. The question of whether she would have reacted the same way if it were a white person is being raised. \n\nNow, considering the context of racial disparities in policing, there's a valid concern that calling the police on people of color can be dangerous. The author acknowledges this, saying she can see how it might be an overreaction. But she also emphasizes that she was scared and didn't know what was happening. \n\nThe key here is the intent and the perception. The author's immediate reaction was based on fear for her safety. She didn't have time to evaluate the situation rationally because she was in a panic. However, the fallout shows that some people perceive her actions as racially motivated. The challenge is balancing personal safety with the real issues of racial profiling.\n\nIn legal terms, if someone reasonably believes they are in danger, calling law enforcement is appropriate. But the perception of the community is that her actions were overreactive and possibly racist. The author isn't claiming the man was dangerous, just that she was scared. The question is whether her fear was justified. \n\nIf the man was just at the wrong door and not a threat, then her call could be seen as unnecessary. But from her perspective, not knowing if he was a threat, it's hard to say she was wrong. The problem is that societal context affects how actions are viewed. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, she acted out of fear for her safety, which is a human instinct. On the other hand, the situation highlights the tension between personal safety and the systemic issues of racial profiling. The author isn't denying the existence of these issues but is being accused of contributing to them. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether her fear was reasonable. If she had a legitimate reason to believe there was a break-in, then she's not in the wrong. But if it turned out there wasn't, some might argue she overreacted. However, given the circumstances\u2014being alone, in the dark, seeing a stranger at the window\u2014her fear seems justified. \n\nThe backlash she's facing is also part of the equation. The community's reaction is harsh, but that doesn't necessarily make her in the wrong. She's being criticized for actions that others might take in similar situations. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's room for criticism about the overreaction, the primary factor is her personal safety. She acted on fear, which is a legitimate response. However, the situation also reflects broader social issues that can't be ignored. The answer might be a nuanced B (not in the wrong) because her actions were driven by self-preservation, even if others disagree.\n"
