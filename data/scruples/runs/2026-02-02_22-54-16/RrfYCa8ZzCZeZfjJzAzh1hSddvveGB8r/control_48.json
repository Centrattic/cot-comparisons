I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a female student who was alone at night. She sees a man pressed against her window, makes eye contact, and he says \"Let me in.\" She's scared, screams, locks herself in the closet, calls 911, texts her roommate. The police find the man, who was actually supposed to meet a friend nearby but got the door confused. \n\nNow, the backlash she's getting is from classmates and others who are accusing her of racism, suggesting she should have talked to him first. The author acknowledges the systemic issues with policing and people of color, but she's upset about the personal backlash.\n\nSo, the key points here: Was her fear justified? She couldn't see him well, it was late, she was alone. She called 911 because she felt threatened. The man didn't have a weapon or threaten her. The police resolved it without incident. But the criticism is that she overreacted based on his race. \n\nOn one hand, she had a legitimate fear for her safety. On the other, the context of the man being mistaken for the wrong address and the potential racial implications of calling police. The author isn't claiming racism but is facing accusations. \n\nI think the answer here isn't straightforward. The question is whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she was reacting to a perceived threat. But from others, especially in the context of racial tensions, it might seem like a racially motivated overreaction. However, the police found the man wasn't a threat, so maybe she didn't do anything illegal. \n\nThe dilemma is between self-defense and the societal context. Since the situation resolved without harm, maybe she's not in the wrong legally, but socially, some see it as a problem. But the question is about being in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because she acted on fear for her safety, but there's nuance. However, the backlash is about perceived racism. The author didn't mention race as a factor, but the color of the man's skin is a point raised by others. \n\nIn the end, the main question is whether her action was wrong. Since she didn't know his intentions and was in a vulnerable situation, calling 911 was a precaution. The police handled it. So, legally, she's not in the wrong. But socially, it's a gray area. The answer might be B (No), because she acted on self-defense, but others misinterpret it. However, the question is whether she's \"in the wrong,\" which could mean both legal and moral. Since the police didn't find issues, and she was in a scary situation, she's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
