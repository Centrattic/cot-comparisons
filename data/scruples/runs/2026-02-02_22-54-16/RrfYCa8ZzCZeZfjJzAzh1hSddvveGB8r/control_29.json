I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The situation is that the woman saw a man pressed against her window at 2 AM, couldn't see clearly, got scared, screamed, locked herself in, and called the police. The police found out it was a mix-up where he was supposed to go to another door. Now she's getting backlash from classmates and people accusing her of racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She was alone, it was late, she was scared. The man was at her window in a way that was threatening. She didn't know if the window was locked or if others were with him. Her natural reaction was fear and self-preservation. In many situations, people might do the same if they felt in danger.\n\nBut then there's the other side: the backlash she's facing. Some people are arguing that she shouldn't have assumed the worst without knowing the man's intent. They're pointing out that calling 911 on a black man can be seen as racially motivated, especially given recent social issues around police interactions with black individuals. The user herself acknowledges that she didn't get a good look and that race wasn't the only factor\u2014she was scared regardless of his color.\n\nThe key here is whether her actions were a reasonable response to a perceived threat. Legally, if you believe there's a threat to your safety, calling the police is appropriate. She didn't have information to confirm his intent, so her fear might be justified. However, the social context complicates things because of the potential for racial bias in these situations.\n\nBut in this case, she didn't know his race when she called 911. She stated she would have called regardless of his color. The backlash is about how her action contributed to a possible negative outcome for the man, even if it was a misunderstanding. The question is whether her fear was excessive or if it's understandable given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, she's being criticized for not approaching him, but in a situation where someone is at your window uninvited and you're scared, approaching them could be dangerous. The police found that there was a misunderstanding, but that doesn't mean her fear was unwarranted at the time.\n\nShe's also being blamed for the social consequences, which is tough. The community's reaction is part of the issue here. She's caught between her legitimate fear and the broader social issues around racial profiling. She's not minimizing the experiences of others, but she's also feeling unfairly targeted for her actions.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong: if someone is in a potentially dangerous situation and calls for help, they're not inherently in the wrong. The backlash might be overreaction, but the question is whether she did something wrong. Since her actions were based on fear and self-defense, and she didn't act with malice or racism, she's probably not in the wrong. However, if she had racial bias influencing her decision, that would be different. But she denies that.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
