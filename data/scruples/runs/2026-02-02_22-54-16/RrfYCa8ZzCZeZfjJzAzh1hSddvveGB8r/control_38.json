I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man based on the given situation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author, a female student, sees a man pressed up against her window at 2 AM. He says \"Let me in,\" causing her to panic. She screams, hides, and calls the police. The police find the man, who was supposed to meet a friend but got the door wrong. \n\nNow, the key points here are her state of fear and the context. She was in a vulnerable situation\u2014alone in the house, two roommates not present, one asleep. The man was at her window, making eye contact, and saying \"Let me in.\" These actions are likely to be perceived as threatening, especially in the middle of the night. Her reaction is a natural response to fear, even if it turns out to be a misunderstanding.\n\nHowever, the backlash she's facing questions her decision to call the police without approaching the situation differently. Critics argue that she should have tried to communicate first or consider if the man needed help. But from her perspective, she was scared and didn't know if he was a threat. Also, she couldn't describe him, which suggests she didn't have a clear view, further supporting her fear.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of race mentioned in the backlash. People are accusing her of racism because the man is Black. The author clarifies she wouldn't have called based on race but on the situation. However, the fact that the person in question is Black adds another layer, considering systemic issues with police interactions. \n\nThe author acknowledges the potential overreaction in hindsight and understands the different dangers people of color face with police. She didn't compare her experience to theirs, which is a plus. The question is whether her actions were wrong. \n\nIn terms of legal and safety standards, calling 911 when you feel threatened is generally advised. The police found the man and resolved the misunderstanding. There's no indication she intentionally targeted him based on race. Her actions were driven by fear for her safety, which is a valid reason to call emergency services. \n\nThe backlash's social impact is also a factor. The author is upset about being accused of racism, which is understandable. The community's response is harsh, not considering her fear and the circumstances. \n\nBalancing both sides: Her actions were a self-protective measure, but the backlash highlights valid concerns about racial bias. However, without evidence that her decision was based on race, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. The situation is complex, involving fear, misunderstanding, and social context. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because she wasn't in the wrong for calling 911 out of fear for her safety, even if it turned out to be a mistake. The key is that her action was a response to perceived immediate danger, not malice or racism.\n"
