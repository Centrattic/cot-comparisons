I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that a female college student saw a man at her window at 2 AM, got scared, called 911, and then faced backlash for it. The man was actually supposed to be entering a different unit.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was alone in the house with two roommates, one away and one asleep. She saw a man at the window, they made eye contact and he said \"Let me in.\" She was in a state of panic, locked herself in the closet, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found out the man was supposed to go to a different door, maybe a friend was expecting him. \n\nThe backlash is coming from classmates who are accusing her of racism because the man was black. They're saying she should have just asked him what he wanted instead of calling the police. The author is defending herself by saying she was scared, didn't know if the window was locked, and didn't want to risk her safety. She also acknowledges the potential for overreaction but is upset about the social consequences and the name-calling.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn many similar cases, people are advised to call the police if they feel a threat to their safety. The author was in a situation where someone was at her window unexpectedly at 2 AM, which is a reasonable time to be concerned. The fact that the man was not a threat doesn't negate her fear at the time. Her actions were based on self-defense and concern for her and her roommate's safety. \n\nHowever, the backlash is pointing out the racial context and the potential for over-policing of Black individuals. The author didn't see the man clearly and didn't know his intentions. Still, the question is about whether she acted wrong. Legally, if someone feels threatened, even if the threat turns out to be unfounded, calling 911 is a standard action. Socially, there's a debate about bias and how police are disproportionately called on Black people for non-threatening situations. \n\nThe author's intention wasn't to racially profile but to ensure safety. She didn't know the man, couldn't verify who he was, and the police handled it. While the outcome was that the man wasn't a threat, the immediate reaction is about perceived danger. So, the answer hinges on whether her fear was justified. \n\nIf the man was at the window saying \"Let me in\" at 2 AM without invitation, it's understandable to be scared. But some might argue that instead of immediately calling police, she could have tried to check the situation more carefully first. However, in a panic, that's not always the case. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to decide if that's correct. The key here is whether her action of calling 911 was a reasonable response to a perceived threat. Since she didn't have information to confirm it was safe, and given the potential danger, her reaction is in line with standard safety procedures. \n\nThe backlash is about the racial implications, which are valid societal concerns, but that doesn't necessarily mean her action was wrong. The question is about personal wrongdoing, not about the systemic issues. So, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
