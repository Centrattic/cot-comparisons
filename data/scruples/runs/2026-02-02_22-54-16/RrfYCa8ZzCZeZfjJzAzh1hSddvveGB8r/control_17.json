I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she called 911 on a Black man who was at her window, and there's backlash for that. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, her reasoning: she found a man outside her window at 2 AM, pressed up against it, saying \"Let me in.\" She was scared, locked herself in, called 911. The police found out he was supposed to visit a friend nearby but got the door wrong. \n\nNow, the question is whether calling 911 was wrong. She was in a scary situation, in her home, and felt threatened. She didn't know his intentions. Her safety is a priority, right? She didn't have time to assess if he was a threat or not. She was scared, and calling the police is a natural reaction when you feel in danger. \n\nBut then there's the backlash. People are accusing her of racism because he's Black. She mentions she wouldn't have called if he were white. But she says she didn't consider his race, just her fear. The problem here is the societal context\u2014Black people, especially men, are disproportionately affected by police violence. So calling 911 can be dangerous for them even if they're not a threat. \n\nShe also says she didn't have time to see if he was a threat. She didn't have a weapon, wasn't inside, but the act of being at the window and saying \"Let me in\" could be seen as a potential threat. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, from her perspective, she was acting out of fear for her safety. From the other side, calling 911 without knowing the situation can lead to harmful outcomes. But she didn't know. She had no way of knowing if he needed help or was a threat. \n\nThe police found out it was a misunderstanding. So maybe she overreacted? But in an emergency, people act on instinct. Also, she's a woman in a domestic situation\u2014society often expects women to be cautious. \n\nBut the backlash is about the racial implications. Even if she didn't intend to be racist, the action had racial consequences. She's not in the wrong for being scared, but maybe she should have considered other ways to handle it? Like contacting a neighbor or friend first? But she was alone, trying not to wake her roommate. \n\nSo balancing both sides: her safety vs. the potential harm to him. Since he wasn't a threat and she didn't have evidence, maybe she overstepped. But in the moment, she couldn't know. It's a tough call. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she acted on genuine fear for her safety. She didn't know his intentions. However, the situation highlights the tension between personal safety and systemic issues with police. But legally, she's not wrong for calling 911 when she felt threatened. The backlash is more about the societal implications, but she isn't in the wrong for her actions in the moment.\n"
