I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a female college student who calls 911 after seeing a black man pressing against her window at 2 AM, which causes her significant fear. The police later find out it was a misunderstanding, but she's being criticized for her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where she felt threatened. She was alone, it was late at night, and someone was at her window. Her actions were driven by fear and a desire to protect herself and her roommates. She didn't turn on the light to avoid waking her roommate, which suggests she was trying to be cautious. When she saw the man and he said \"Let me in,\" she panicked. That's a natural response to a perceived threat.\n\nHowever, the backlash she's facing is about the race of the person she called 911 on. Critics are suggesting that she shouldn't have assumed the worst and that she should have tried to communicate first. There's also an implication that her race (since she's a white woman) might have influenced her reaction. The author acknowledges that black people face different dangers with the police, which is an important point. She didn't confront the man directly, which could have been dangerous, and she didn't know if he was alone or armed.\n\nThe question is whether her actions were wrong. Legally, if you feel threatened, calling 911 is appropriate. The police found it was a misunderstanding, but that doesn't mean her initial fear was unfounded. The problem arises when people criticize her based on the race of the individual, suggesting that race was the main factor in her decision. The author didn't describe the man, which shows she didn't have time to judge based on race, but the critics are implying racial profiling.\n\nOn the other hand, in a society where police interactions can be dangerous for black individuals, calling the police might be seen as a harmful action if done without clear evidence. The author's fear is valid, but the context of systemic issues complicates things. The key here is that she acted out of self-defense and wasn't aware of the man's intentions. The backlash is questioning her judgment, but she had no way of knowing the truth at the time.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were a response to a perceived threat in a high-stress situation. She didn't have time to verify intentions, and her primary concern was safety. While the critics raise valid points about racial disparities in police interactions, the author's action wasn't based on race but on fear for her safety. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for calling 911, even if the outcome was a misunderstanding.\n"
