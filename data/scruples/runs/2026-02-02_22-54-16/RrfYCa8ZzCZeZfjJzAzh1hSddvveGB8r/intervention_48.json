I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a female college student who wakes up at 2 AM, goes to the kitchen, and sees a man pressed against the window. She's scared, can't see clearly, and he says \"Let me in.\" She screams, locks herself in a closet, calls 911, and texts her roommate. The police find out the man was supposed to visit a friend but got confused. \n\nNow, the backlash she's getting is from classmates and others accusing her of racism because the man was Black. They question why she didn't just ask him what he wanted instead of calling the police. Some even compare it to calling 911 on any Black person. \n\nThe author acknowledges that people of color face dangers with the police and that she didn't compare her experience to theirs. She's hurt by the backlash but also wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, from her perspective, she was in a scary situation, felt threatened, and acted based on fear for her safety. She didn't know the man, couldn't see him well, and was in a vulnerable situation. Her actions were to protect herself.\n\nOn the other side, others are pointing out that racial profiling is a real issue, and calling police on a Black man without clear aggression could contribute to systemic problems. They might argue that she should have tried to de-escalate first.\n\nBut the key points here are her intent. She didn't call 911 based on his race but because she was scared and saw someone at her window saying \"Let me in.\" The police confirmed he wasn't dangerous. She also couldn't describe him, which suggests she didn't have racial bias in her initial assessment.\n\nThe question is whether her reaction was reasonable given the circumstances. In similar situations, if someone breaks into your home or tries to enter, calling the police is standard. The fact that the man was Black is a factor in the context of broader societal issues, but the author's immediate reaction was to self-protect.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Maybe not. The backlash seems to be more about the racial implications rather than the specific actions. However, the author might need to consider how her actions fit into a larger context of racial bias, even if unintentionally. But given the info, her actions were a response to a perceived threat in the moment, which is a self-defense mechanism. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
