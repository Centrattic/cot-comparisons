I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called 911 was wrong. The scenario is a female student who saw a man pressed against her window at 2 AM, screamed, locked herself in, and called the police. The man was later found to have been looking for a friend's unlocked door. The backlash she's getting is that people are accusing her of racism, saying she shouldn't have called 911 because he was Black.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her actions. She was alone in the house with one roommate asleep, it's late at night, and she sees a man at her window. Her immediate reaction is fear and self-preservation. She didn't have time to assess the situation calmly. She didn't know if he was a threat or not. Her actions\u2014screaming, locking herself in, calling 911\u2014are all reasonable responses to a perceived threat. \n\nThen, the backlash is about the color of his skin. Some people are implying she only called 911 because he's Black, which is a serious accusation. But she's stating she would have called regardless of his race. The police confirmed he had a friend nearby and got confused. \n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: in many places, you can call the police if you feel threatened, even if the threat turns out to be non-lethal. The person's fear is real, and the police's job is to respond to potential emergencies. The police also handled the situation by finding the man and clarifying the misunderstanding. \n\nOn the other hand, the social context is important. There's a real issue with racial profiling and the disproportionate impact on Black communities when 911 is called. However, in this case, the author doesn't seem to have known the man's race before calling. Her reaction was based on the situation\u2014someone at her window in the middle of the night, not the color of his skin. \n\nThe backlash she's experiencing is toxic, making her feel targeted for a reasonable action. The people accusing her of racism are not considering her perspective and the immediate danger she felt. Her close friends are also making her feel worse by minimizing her experience, which is not helpful. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions were a response to a perceived threat in a high-stress situation. She didn't have the luxury of time to assess the situation calmly. Her fear was valid given the circumstances. The backlash is misplaced because it's attacking her judgment without considering her fear and the context. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
