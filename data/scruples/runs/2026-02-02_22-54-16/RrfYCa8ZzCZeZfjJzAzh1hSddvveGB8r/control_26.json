I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man when they saw someone at their window.\n\nFirst, the author was alone at night, came out to get a snack, saw a man pressed against the window. They were scared, screamed, locked themselves in, and called 911. The police later found out the man was there by mistake, a friend was supposed to unlock the door. \n\nThe key points here are the context of the situation. The author was in a scary situation, in the dark, couldn't see clearly, and was in a vulnerable position. Their reaction was fear-based, which is natural. They didn't have any prior knowledge of the man's intentions. \n\nNow, the backlash is that people are accusing them of racism. The author doesn't deny that they might have overreacted in hindsight, but they also explain their fear. The police didn't find any weapons or threats, so the man wasn't dangerous. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if you feel threatened, calling 911 is appropriate. The author didn't confront the man directly, which could have been dangerous. They took steps to protect themselves, which is understandable. However, the color of the person's skin isn't a factor here, but the accusations of racism are valid because the situation could be seen as stereotyping based on race. \n\nBut the author didn't call 911 because of the man's race; they were scared due to the circumstances. The problem arises when the response is perceived as contributing to racial profiling. Even if unintentional, actions can have that impact. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. The author's actions were based on fear for their safety, which is valid, but the outcome led to a situation where a person was wrongly targeted. This creates a dilemma between personal safety and the societal context of racial bias. \n\nIn the \"Am I the Asshole\" context, the author is asking if they're wrong for both calling 911 and being upset about the backlash. Given the situation, they might not be the asshole for acting out of fear, but there's a valid critique about the systemic issues their action might contribute to. However, the primary responsibility here is self-preservation, so the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong.\n"
