I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves her calling 911 when she saw a black man at her window at 2 AM. She was alone, scared, and didn't know if the window was locked or if there were others. The police arrived and found out the man had a legitimate reason but got confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a vulnerable situation\u2014late at night, alone with only one roommate asleep. Her immediate reaction was fear and self-preservation. She didn't have a clear view of the man, couldn't describe him, and was panicking. Her actions\u2014screaming, locking herself in, and calling 911\u2014seem like a natural response to a perceived threat.\n\nNow, the backlash she's facing is significant. People are accusing her of racism, which is a serious charge. But she's not denying the backlash's validity; she's trying to understand both sides. She acknowledges that black people face disproportionate dangers with police, which shows she's aware of the sensitivity. However, she's also justified in her fear given the circumstances. It's a balance between personal safety and societal concerns.\n\nThe key points are: was the threat real enough to warrant calling 911, and was the backlash justified? The man wasn't inside the house, didn't have a weapon, but the author couldn't be sure. Her fear was based on the immediate danger, not the man's race. The police response resolved the situation without harm, so no one was hurt. The backlash seems to stem from a different perspective on safety and systemic issues, which is a valid concern but might not negate her right to self-defense.\n\nIn the U.S., there's often a debate between \"safety first\" and \"avoiding racial profiling.\" The author didn't describe the man by race, and her reason for calling was fear for her safety. While some might argue she could have checked more before calling, the question is whether her actions were reasonable under the stress of the moment. Given that she couldn't be sure and was in a vulnerable position, her response seems understandable. The backlash, while perhaps well-intentioned, may be overreaching in assuming intent to discriminate without evidence. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
