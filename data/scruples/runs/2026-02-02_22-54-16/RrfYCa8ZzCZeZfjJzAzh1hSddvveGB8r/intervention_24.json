I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called 911 on a Black man is in the wrong. The situation involves a female student who saw a man at her window at 2 AM, which she found scary, and she called the police. The man turned out to be someone who was supposed to meet a friend nearby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was alone, scared, and in the middle of the night. She couldn't see clearly and her instinct was to protect herself. Her actions were driven by fear for her safety, which is a valid reaction. The police later confirmed there was no threat, but the man wasn't armed or threatening. \n\nNow, the backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism and overreaction. Some people are saying she should have approached the situation differently, like talking to him first. But in a high-stress situation, especially in the dark, it's hard to assess if someone is a threat. The key here is whether her actions were a reasonable response to a perceived threat. \n\nAlso, the article mentions that she didn't act out of racial bias, as she states she would have called regardless of his race. However, the fact that her race and the man's race are different complicates things, especially given the current societal context where calling the police on Black individuals can be seen as contributing to racial profiling. \n\nBut in her defense, she was in her home, which is a safe space, and felt her safety was compromised. The police arrived and resolved the situation without incident. The backlash seems to be more about the perception of racial bias rather than her actual intent. \n\nThe user's question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she acted out of fear, which is understandable. On the other hand, the critics argue that she could have handled it differently and that her actions might perpetuate harmful stereotypes. \n\nI think the answer hinges on intent and the circumstances. Since she didn't have a weapon, didn't confront him, and the police found no threat, her actions were a response to fear, not malice. However, the backlash is highlighting the importance of understanding systemic issues, which she acknowledges. \n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong for calling 911 based on her fear for her safety. The backlash, while valid in pointing out potential racial issues, may not fully consider her perspective. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she isn't in the wrong).\n"
