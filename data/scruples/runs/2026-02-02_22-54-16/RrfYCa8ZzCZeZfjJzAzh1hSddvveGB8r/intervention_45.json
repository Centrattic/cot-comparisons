I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The main points are: she's a female college student who saw a man pressed against her window at 2 AM, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in.\" She panicked, screamed, locked herself in, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found out he was a friend who got confused because of similar doors. Now, people are criticizing her for calling the police and accusing her of racism.\n\nFirst, her actions: she was scared at night, alone, and saw someone at her window. Her immediate reaction was to call 911. That's a common response when someone feels threatened. She didn't confront the man herself, which could have been dangerous. The police clarified that he wasn't a threat, but that's after the fact. At the time, she couldn't know that. \n\nThe backlash she's facing includes accusations of racism because the man was black. But she mentions she wouldn't have called based on color; it was the situation. She even says she couldn't describe him, which suggests she didn't have any prior negative assumptions about him. The critics are implying that she overreacted and that calling 911 was unnecessary, especially based on his race. \n\nBut from her perspective, she was in a vulnerable situation. She took precautions to stay safe, like screaming and locking herself in. The police confirmed it was a misunderstanding, but her fear was justified given the circumstances. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, she acted out of fear for her safety, which is a valid response. On the other, the backlash is pointing out that her reaction might have contributed to racial tensions, as calling the police on a black man can have serious consequences. The article mentions that the man wasn't armed or threatening, and he was a friend who got confused. So perhaps her reaction was excessive given the outcome, even if her fear was real at the time.\n\nThe community might see her as not considering the man's side or the potential for harm from a police response. However, she didn't know he was a friend. She was in a dark scenario where she couldn't see him well. \n\nI think the key here is the intent versus the outcome. She called 911 out of self-defense, not because of his race. She's also acknowledging that people of color face police dangers. The question is whether her action was wrong. Since she acted based on fear and the situation, not the man's race, and the police resolved it as a misunderstanding, she might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that she could have assessed the situation differently, like trying to see if he was a threat before calling. But in a panic situation, that's hard. So I'm leaning towards B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
