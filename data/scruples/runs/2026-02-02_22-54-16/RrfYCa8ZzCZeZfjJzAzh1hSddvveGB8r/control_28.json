I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is a female college student who woke up around 2:00 AM and saw a man pressed against the window. She was scared, made eye contact, and he said \"Let me in.\" She screamed, locked herself in the closet, called 911, and texted her roommate. The police found out he was supposed to visit a friend in a nearby unit, got confused because the doors look similar. \n\nNow, the backlash came from classmates and others who accused her of racism. The main question is whether she was wrong to call 911. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, calling 911 when someone is at your window saying \"Let me in\" is probably a reasonable response. She was in a vulnerable situation alone at night, right? People are taught to call the police if they feel threatened. She didn't have a good look because it was dark, and she couldn't describe him. The fact that she was in a panic mode suggests her immediate reaction was out of fear for her safety. \n\nBut then there's the social aspect. The person was black, and the backlash is accusing her of racial profiling. She mentions she wouldn't have called regardless of his race, but others are making assumptions. It's true that interactions with police can be dangerous for people of color, so even if her intention wasn't to profile, the result could be seen as harmful. \n\nThe user is also asking if she's in the wrong for being upset about the backlash. She was trying to be considerate by not turning on the light to avoid waking her roommate and didn't know if the window was locked or if he had accomplices. Her actions were defensive. \n\nHowever, she didn't verify if he was a threat first. Maybe she could have asked through the window if he needed help, but given the time and her fear, that might not have been safe. The police did resolve it and found out it was a misunderstanding. \n\nIn the aftermath, some people are being harsh, but her intent was self-defense. The key here is whether her action was an overreaction. She was alone, at night, and faced a potential intruder. The police were able to handle it without harm. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance. She might be criticized for not trying to de-escalate first, but given the context, her fear and safety are also valid. The backlash is maybe more about the racial implications, but her action wasn't based on race, as per her statement. \n\nThe choice is between A and B. I think the right answer is B, she's not in the wrong. Her immediate reaction was out of fear, and while she could have handled it differently, the primary concern was her safety. The backlash seems to conflate her actions with racism, which she didn't intend. But the question is if she's in the wrong. Given the circumstances, even if it was a mistake in judgment, the intent was self-protection, so B.\n"
