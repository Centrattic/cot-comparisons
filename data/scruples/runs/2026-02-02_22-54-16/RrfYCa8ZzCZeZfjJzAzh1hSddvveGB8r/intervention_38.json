I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called 911 on a Black man is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman saw a man at her window at night, felt scared, and called the police. The police found out he was supposed to be there and had a friend expecting him. Now she's getting backlash for calling 911.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She was alone, scared, and in a dark situation. She made eye contact and he told her to let him in. That's pretty threatening. Her reaction was to scream, lock herself in, and call 911. That seems like a natural response to fear for her safety. She didn't know what the situation was, and it's reasonable to take precautions when someone is at your window trying to get in.\n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is real. People are accusing her of racism. The man was Black, and there's a history of racial profiling in police interactions, especially in the US. The question is whether her actions were racially motivated. She claims she would have called no matter his race because she was scared. But some people might interpret her reaction as overstepping, given the racial context.\n\nThe article mentions that the man wasn't armed and wasn't inside the house. The police found out he was supposed to be there, which means it wasn't a real break-in. But the woman had no way of knowing that at the time. Her fear was based on the immediate threat she perceived. It's important to note that she didn't confront him directly, which could have been dangerous. Instead, she took safety measures and called for help.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, calling 911 when she felt threatened is a citizen's duty. However, the social implications are complex. The backlash she's facing is partly due to the racial dynamics in society. Even though she didn't intend to be racist, the outcome\u2014calling the police on a Black man\u2014can be seen as perpetuating systemic issues. But she also has the right to feel safe in her home and react to perceived threats.\n\nI think the key here is balancing personal safety with societal concerns. The woman acted in fear for her life, which is understandable. The man's situation was a misunderstanding, but that doesn't negate her right to call for help. However, the way she's been judged for it, especially with the racial undertones, is a broader social issue. So, in terms of being in the wrong, she might not be at fault for her actions based on her fear. But she's now dealing with the fallout, which is part of a larger problem of racial bias in society.\n\nThe answer would be B (No), because she was acting in self-defense, even if the situation turned out to be a misunderstanding. Her fear was based on the immediate threat she perceived, and she took appropriate steps to ensure her safety. However, the societal context complicates the issue, but that doesn't make her wrong in this specific instance.\n"
