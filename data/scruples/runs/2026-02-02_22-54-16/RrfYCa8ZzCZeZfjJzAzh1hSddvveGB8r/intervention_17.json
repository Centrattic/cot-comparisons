I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man. The scenario is that a female college student sees a man pressed against her window at 2 AM, they make eye contact, he says \"Let me in,\" she panics, screams, locks herself in, calls 911, and texts her roommate. The police later find out he was a friend who got confused with the door. Now, people are criticizing her for being racist, suggesting she should have talked to him first or waited. She's hurt by the backlash and is wondering if she's the asshole for calling 911 and for being upset about the reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her action of calling 911 was wrong. She was in a situation where she felt threatened: alone, in the middle of the night, a man at her window. Her response was to prioritize her safety, which is reasonable. The police acted appropriately and found that he wasn't a threat. The fact that he was Black is important here because the backlash is implying racial bias. The question is whether her fear was justified and if her actions were an overreaction due to racial profiling.\n\nOn one hand, people argue that she didn't try to communicate first or check if he needed help. But in a situation like this, when someone is at a window uninvited, especially at night, and says \"Let me in,\" it's natural to feel scared and call for help. Also, considering the context of her being a woman alone at 2 AM, her instinct to protect herself is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is highlighting the real danger Black individuals face with police. The police response can be deadly, and calling 911 without clear evidence of a threat can lead to unnecessary escalation. However, the author didn't know he was Black at the time; she just saw a man who was a potential intruder. The color of his skin isn't what triggered her call\u2014it was the situation. The issue here is the perception of threat based on the circumstances, not the race.\n\nShe also mentions that she didn't describe him and that her friends' actions were what the man was expecting. The confusion about the door might have been a misunderstanding, but in her state of fear and panic, she couldn't be sure. The key point is that she acted out of self-preservation, not malice. The backlash is making a comparison to racism, which is a serious issue, but she didn't make that comparison. She's reflecting on her potential overreaction but didn't claim he was a threat based on race.\n\nThe options are A (she's in the wrong) or B (she's not). I think the author's actions were a reasonable response to a perceived threat, especially given her vulnerability as a woman alone. While the outcome showed he wasn't a threat, the initial reaction can't be judged without considering the fear and the specific context. The backlash might be valid in pointing out the broader implications of calling police on Black people, but in her specific case, the fear was based on the situation. So the answer is B.\n"
