I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is at fault for calling 911 on a Black man. The story is that a female college student, in the middle of the night, sees a man pressing against her window, says \"Let me in,\" and she panics, calls 911, and then faces backlash from classmates for overreacting and being racist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in most places, you can call the police if you feel there's a threat to your safety. The woman was scared and took precautions by locking herself in and contacting the police. The man turned out to be a friend who was supposed to be let in, but the situation was a misunderstanding. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the woman's fear is understandable. She was alone, in the middle of the night, and couldn't see clearly. She didn't know if it was a threat. The police response indicated that there was no actual danger. However, the backlash is pointing out that she didn't attempt to communicate with the man first, assuming he was a threat based on his race, perhaps. The question is whether her action was justified or if she overreacted, especially considering the potential harm in calling the police on a Black man, given systemic issues with police interactions.\n\nThe author mentions that she's not comparing her experience to the systemic issues Black people face, but people are interpreting her action as racism. The key here is whether her actions, while not malicious, could be seen as contributing to a problem. She didn't know his intent, but she didn't wait to communicate. However, if she was in a state of panic, maybe she wasn't in a position to do that. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a societal issue where calling the police on Black people for minor misunderstandings can lead to tragic outcomes. Even if the man wasn't threatening, her call could have led to a dangerous situation. The police resolved it without incident here, but the question is if her action was wrong regardless of the outcome.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Legally, maybe not\u2014she felt threatened. Ethically, there's a gray area. She was scared, but could she have tried to talk to him first? The response from others is about the impact of such calls on the Black community, which is a valid concern. The author is conflicted, acknowledging the potential overreaction but also the fear she felt. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether her fear-based reaction justifies the call, or if she should have considered alternatives. Since she was in fear for her safety and the situation was ambiguous, it's hard to say she was wrong. However, the backlash is about the broader implications, not just the individual case. So maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong for calling 911, but there's a societal issue that needs addressing. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
