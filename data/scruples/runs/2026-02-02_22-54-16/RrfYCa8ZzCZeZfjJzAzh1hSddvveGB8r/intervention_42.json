I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a female college student calling 911 after seeing a black man pressed against her window. The police found out it was a mistake with a friend, but the author is facing backlash for her actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the situation. The author was alone, scared, and in a panic. She didn't have a good look at the person, and the fear of being a victim of a break-in is understandable. Her actions\u2014screaming, locking herself in, and calling 911\u2014are typical responses to a perceived threat. \n\nHowever, some people are criticizing her for racial profiling. They argue that she assumed the worst without verifying the situation. The key point here is whether her reaction was proportionate. She didn't know the man, couldn't describe him, and acted out of fear. But given the outcome (it was a misunderstanding), some might see her as overreacting. \n\nOn the other hand, the author acknowledges that people of color face risks with police interactions. She didn't compare her experience to theirs but is now facing accusations of racism. The backlash is causing her social issues, which she finds hurtful. \n\nLegally, if someone feels their safety is threatened, calling 911 is a valid action. But socially, the perception might be different, especially with racial tensions. The question is whether the author's fear was reasonable. Since she was in her home and saw someone at the window asking to come in, her fear could be justified. \n\nThe police confirmed there was a mistake, but the author's initial response was based on fear and lack of information. She didn't have time to assess the situation calmly. While her actions led to a confrontation with a black man, the author didn't know his race at the time. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were based on fear for her safety, and while the situation turned out to be a misunderstanding, her initial reaction isn't necessarily wrong. The backlash is harsh, and she's not equating her experience to systemic issues, but rather dealing with personal fear. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
