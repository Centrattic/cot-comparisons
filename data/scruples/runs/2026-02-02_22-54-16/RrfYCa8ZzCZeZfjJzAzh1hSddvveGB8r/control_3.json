I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a female college student called 911 after seeing a black man pressed up against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, locked herself in the closet, and called the police. The police found out the man was expecting a friend and got confused. Now, her classmates are criticizing her for being racist and calling her names. She's feeling hurt by the backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her actions. She was alone, in the middle of the night, saw someone she couldn't identify, and felt threatened. Her instinct was to call 911, which is a common response to a perceived threat, especially when safety is in question. Fear can lead people to overreact, and she didn't have the chance to assess the situation fully. \n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is about the man being black, and the accusations of racism. It's true that people of color, especially Black individuals, face disproportionate risks with police interactions. So, calling the police without knowing the person's intent could contribute to those risks. However, the author didn't know the man's race at the time of the incident, as it was dark and she couldn't see him clearly. Her decision was based on fear and uncertainty, not race. \n\nThe question is whether that's enough to say she's in the wrong. Legally, she might not have acted wrong because she felt threatened. Ethically, it's a bit more complex. She didn't have malicious intent; she was scared. However, the aftermath shows that her actions led to scrutiny, and she's now facing accusations of racism. She also acknowledges that she could have overreacted in hindsight.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? If we consider the intent versus the impact, her intent was to protect herself, which is understandable. The impact was a police response and possible harm to the other person. However, the fact that the police found out the man was not a threat might mitigate some of the negative impact. \n\nAlso, the backlash she's facing seems harsh. People are making assumptions about her racism, which she didn't intend. She even mentions that she's not comparing her experience to the systemic issues Black people face. The key here is whether her action was wrong based on her intentions and the circumstances. \n\nIn many cases, when someone is in fear for their safety, calling the police is a reasonable response, even if it turns out to be a misunderstanding. However, the fact that the man was Black and the subsequent accusations of racism can't be ignored. The situation highlights the tension between personal safety and racial bias. \n\nBut the author didn't act based on the man's race. She couldn't even describe him. So her reaction was based on fear, not race. Therefore, she isn't in the wrong for calling 911. However, the backlash is also problematic because people are projecting racism onto her without evidence. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her actions were based on fear and a legitimate safety concern, and she didn't have the information to know the man's race. The backlash is unjust given the circumstances.\n"
