I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for calling 911 on a Black man. The situation is a bit complex because it involves both the writer's fear and the subsequent backlash they received.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The writer is a female college student who found a man pressed against her window at 2:00 AM. She was alone except for a roommate who was asleep. She was scared, made eye contact with the man who said \"Let me in,\" which is pretty alarming. She screamed, locked herself in, called 911, and messaged her roommate. The police found out that the man had a friend who was expecting him and thought the door was unlocked. The doors looked similar, so he got confused.\n\nNow, the backlash comes from classmates and others accusing her of racism. They're saying she should have just talked to him or waited. But she couldn't describe him because it was dark. She argues that she would have called regardless of his race because she was scared. She's also acknowledging the danger Black people face with police, which is a valid point. Her friends are saying her experience isn't comparable to the systemic issues Black people face, but she's not making that comparison.\n\nSo, the question is whether she was wrong to call 911. On one hand, she was in a scary situation, in her home, and felt threatened. She had a reasonable fear for her safety, especially at night. Her actions were a response to that fear. On the other hand, the man turned out to have a benign reason, and the backlash centers around the idea that calling the police on a Black person can be harmful, especially given racial tensions and police brutality. \n\nBut the key here is that she called 911 because of her fear of a potential break-in or threat. She didn't know who it was, couldn't see well, and the situation was tense. In such cases, people might react out of fear. However, the criticism is that she didn't consider alternatives, like checking if he was a friend or waiting. But given the circumstances, she was in a vulnerable position. Also, she didn't know if there were others with him or if he was armed. \n\nThe writer also mentions that she recognizes the systemic issues and doesn't compare her experience to that of Black people. She's trying to see both sides. The problem is that her actions, while based on fear, contributed to a racialized incident. Even if she intended to act in self-defense, the result was a call to police that could have been perceived as racially motivated, especially given the context of Black men often being targeted by police.\n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, she might not be at fault for calling 911 when she felt threatened. But socially, the backlash is about the racial implications. It's a tough spot because she acted out of fear, but her actions might have perpetuated negative stereotypes. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, maybe not. Socially, some might say yes because of the racial aspect. But others would argue that she had a right to feel unsafe and act accordingly.\n\nThe answer might depend on balancing personal safety and the impact of such actions. The writer isn't in the wrong for being scared and calling for help, but perhaps she could have considered other steps first. However, in high-stress situations, people might not think through all options. The fact that the man didn't have a weapon and was just mistaken adds to the complexity. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she acted based on her fear for her safety in a situation that seemed threatening. However, she could have been more aware of the racial implications, but the primary action was a response to immediate fear, which is not inherently wrong.\n"
