I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves calling 911 on a black man who was at their window, but it turns out he was just confused and had a friend expecting him. The author is being criticized for racism, but they argue they were scared and didn't have more information.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was alone in the house, it was late at night, and someone was at the window. They were scared, locked themselves in, and called the police as a safety measure. Fear for one's safety is a valid reason to call emergency services. However, there's also the aspect of racial profiling here. The author mentions that classmates accused them of racism because the person was black. But the author also states they would have called regardless of the person's race because of the situation.\n\nOn one hand, the police resolved the situation without harm. On the other hand, the author's actions led to criticism about over-policing and racial bias. The author is in a tough spot between their fear and the social implications. It's important to note that the person wasn't threatening, just confused. But in terms of legal and safety standards, calling 911 when someone is at your window and making threatening gestures (like saying \"Let me in\") is understandable. \n\nThe backlash the author is experiencing is part of a larger societal issue where people of color face disproportionate scrutiny with law enforcement. The author might not have intended to be racist, but their action, combined with the racial context, can be seen as problematic. However, the author is also just reacting to a scary situation. \n\nI need to weigh the intent versus the impact. The author's intent was self-protection, which is valid. The impact, though, contributed to a situation that could be seen as part of systemic issues. However, without malicious intent and given the circumstances, it's not clear that the author is in the wrong. The question is whether fear of a situation justifies calling 911 regardless of the person's race. In many cases, people are advised to call the police if they feel threatened, even if it turns out to be a misunderstanding. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They acted out of fear in a potentially dangerous situation, and while the outcome was a misunderstanding, their actions were a reasonable response to the threat they perceived. The criticism they face is part of a broader societal issue, but that doesn't make their initial action wrong.\n"
