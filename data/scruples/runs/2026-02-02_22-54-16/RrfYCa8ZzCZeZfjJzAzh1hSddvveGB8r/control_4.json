I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The situation involves a female student who saw someone at her window, got scared, called the police, and then faced backlash from classmates for being racist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman was alone, it was late at night, she saw a man at her window. She was scared, didn't know if he was a threat. She didn't get a good look at him, couldn't describe him. The police found out it was a mistake\u2014he was supposed to go to another door. Now she's being criticized for calling 911 because of his race.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, she was in fear for her safety, her natural reaction to a potential break-in. On the other, people are accusing her of racial bias because the person was black. But she explicitly says she would have called regardless of his race. \n\nBut the problem here is that when you call 911, especially for someone outside your home, it can lead to police escalation. There's a real issue where black people are disproportionately affected by police interactions, which can be dangerous. The author didn't confirm the person was a threat, just reacted out of fear. That could be seen as overreacting, especially since it turned out there was no real threat.\n\nHowever, she was in a vulnerable situation. It's dark, she's alone, and someone is at her window. Her instinct to seek help is understandable. The backlash she's facing is harsh, but maybe part of the issue is the societal context of racial profiling. Even if she didn't intend to be racist, her action contributed to a situation where an innocent person was involved with police, which is more risky for people of color. \n\nBut then, she couldn't have known his intentions. The man was supposed to go to another door, so maybe he was confused. If someone is at your window saying \"Let me in\" unexpectedly, that's pretty alarming. She didn't have information to know he wasn't a threat. \n\nThe dilemma here is balancing personal safety and the potential consequences of calling police, which can be more dangerous for some communities. The author didn't act with malice, but her action still had negative implications. However, she was scared and in a position where she couldn't verify the threat. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's complicated. She might not be malicious, but the action had a problematic outcome. However, given the circumstances, her fear is valid. The backlash she's receiving might be unfair, but the criticism about racial bias is also a legitimate concern. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user might lean towards B, because her intention wasn't racial, and she was in fear. But others might say A because her action, even if unintended, contributed to a racially charged situation. \n\nBut I think in this case, since she acted out of fear and couldn't have known the man's intentions, she's not in the wrong. The backlash is more about the broader societal issues rather than her specific action. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
