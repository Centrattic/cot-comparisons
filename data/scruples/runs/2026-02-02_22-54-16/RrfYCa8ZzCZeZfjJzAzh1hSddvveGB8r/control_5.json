I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for calling 911 on a black man. The situation is described in the given text.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a female college student who, at 2 AM, sees a man pressed against her window. She's scared, thinks it might be a break-in, and calls 911. The police later find out that the man was supposed to be at a nearby unit but got confused. The backlash from classmates is significant, with accusations of racism.\n\nSo, the main question is whether her action of calling 911 was wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, people have the right to call emergency services if they feel threatened or if they believe there's a crime in progress. The author was in a vulnerable situation at night, alone with one roommate asleep. The man was at the window, making eye contact and saying \"Let me in.\" That could be perceived as a threat, even if it wasn't. Her actions\u2014screaming, locking herself in, calling 911\u2014are self-protective. \n\nOn the other hand, the backlash is pointing out the racial implications. Some argue that calling 911 on a black man could lead to dangerous outcomes, especially with the history of police violence against people of color. The author acknowledges this and says she doesn't make the comparison. But her actions, while based on fear, might be seen as contributing to the problem. \n\nThe key here is intent versus outcome. The author didn't know the man's race when she called 911; her fear was based on the situation. However, the outcome was that an innocent person was involved, and the author is now facing accusations of racism. But does that make her wrong? \n\nShe didn't act with malice or racial intent. She acted out of fear for her safety. The article is asking if she's \"in the wrong,\" which could be about whether her action was justified. Legally, she might be justified. Morally or socially, there's a debate because of the racial overtones, even if unintended. \n\nThe author also mentions she's being blamed for not asking him what he wanted or waiting. But in a high-stress, scary situation, it's reasonable she panicked. People don't always think rationally in fear. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were a response to a perceived threat. She didn't know the man's intentions, and her safety is a priority. The backlash is problematic because it accuses her of racism without evidence, but her action itself was based on self-defense. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for calling 911, but she might need to consider how her actions fit into broader social issues. But the question is about her being in the wrong. \n\nGiven the context, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
