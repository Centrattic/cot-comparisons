I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a female college student who called 911 because she saw a black man pressing against her window at 2 AM. She was scared, didn't turn on the light to avoid waking her roommate, and ended up in a closet calling emergency services. The police found out he was supposed to visit a friend in a similar unit.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if calling the police was the right action. The author was in a vulnerable situation: alone at night, possibly in a dark environment, and someone was at her window. Fear for personal safety is a valid reason to contact law enforcement. The fact that the man didn't have a weapon or threaten her directly might lead some to say it was an overreaction, but she couldn't see clearly and was in a state of panic. \n\nNext, the backlash she's facing. People are accusing her of racism, which is a serious charge. The key here is intent. She explicitly states she would have called regardless of the person's race. The problem is that her action, while based on fear, could be seen as contributing to racial profiling. However, she didn't know his race at the time because it was dark, and she couldn't describe him. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she acted out of fear and tried to protect herself. On the other, the aftermath has caused social repercussions, and there's a broader societal issue about racial bias in calling police. But since she didn't know his race and acted on immediate fear for safety, it's hard to say she was racially motivated. The friends who support her and the police's explanation that the man had a legitimate reason (though he was in the wrong unit) might mitigate her wrongdoing. \n\nHowever, there's a debate about how to handle ambiguous situations. Some might argue that she should have tried to communicate first, but given the time of night and the potential danger, her instinct to self-protect is understandable. The fact that she didn't make assumptions based on race but on the situation (someone at the window unexpectedly) is important. \n\nThe backlash seems unfair, but the author is being questioned about her reaction. She's not comparing her experience to police violence against black people, which is a sensitive issue. The friends who remind her of the racial disparities are correct in pointing out the systemic problem, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is an asshole for her action. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), because she's not in the wrong for calling 911 out of fear. The backlash is harsh, but her primary concern was safety. However, there's a nuance where in hindsight, maybe she could have considered other possibilities, but under the circumstances, her actions were justified.\n"
