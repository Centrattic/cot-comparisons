I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street\u2014totally pressed up against the window. I didn\u2019t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said \u201cLet me in.\u201d It was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me \u201cBreak in Barbie\u201d because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn\u2019t describe him at all to police, but I would\u2019ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just talk to him like a human being?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?\u201d And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like \u201cIf it were a white man you wouldn\u2019t have called the police I bet.\u201d \u201cDo you call 911 every time you see a black person?\u201d And asking things like \u201cDid you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.\u201d And the most common one \u201cHow did you know he didn\u2019t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?\u201d \n\nTo try and see things from the other side \u2014 I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn\u2019t brandish a weapon, he didn\u2019t threaten to harm me, and he wasn\u2019t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll blow over. Even close friends who I\u2019ve vented about this to have said \u201cYah but what you\u2019re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.\u201d I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I\u2019d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she called 911 because she saw a black man pressing against her window and said \"Let me in.\" She was scared, locked herself in the closet, and called the police. The police found out he was a friend who got the door wrong. Now people are accusing her of racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her perspective. She was alone, in the middle of the night, saw someone at her window, made eye contact, and he told her to let him in. That's definitely a scary situation. She didn't know if he was a threat, and her instincts were to protect herself. She didn't have a good look at him because it was dark, so she couldn't identify him. In such situations, people usually call the police if they feel threatened, regardless of the person's race. She mentioned she would have called 911 no matter his race, which is important because it shows she didn't target him based on race.\n\nOn the other hand, the person she called 911 on was actually a friend who was confused. The backlash comes from people who think she shouldn't have called the police without knowing the situation. They're pointing out that calling 911 on a black man could be seen as racist, especially given the societal issues around police interactions with black individuals. The author acknowledges that people of color face dangers from police that white people don't, so she's aware of the other side.\n\nNow, the question is whether her actions were wrong. She acted out of fear for her safety. In many places, you can call the police if you feel there's an immediate threat. However, if there wasn't an actual threat and it was a misunderstanding, some might argue she overreacted. But she couldn't know that at the time. She didn't have a good view and couldn't be sure. The key here is that her intent wasn't to be racist; she was scared. But the result was a false alarm that could be interpreted as contributing to racial profiling.\n\nThe backlash is harsh, but she's also being accused of not considering the other perspective. However, she did express understanding of the racial issues involved. The question is whether her actions were wrong. If her primary concern was her safety and she genuinely believed she was in danger, then calling 911 isn't necessarily wrong. However, if her fear was based on stereotypes or if she didn't consider the possibility that it was a non-threatening situation, it could be seen as problematic.\n\nBut she explains that she couldn't see clearly and was in a vulnerable position. The man did say \"Let me in,\" which could be misinterpreted. So, in her situation, I think her reaction was a natural response to fear. The fact that she didn't know his intentions and was trying to protect herself and her roommates might justify her actions. However, the aftermath and the impact on the other person's life (even though it was a misunderstanding) is a negative consequence. But was she in the wrong? Maybe not, because she acted in self-defense. However, there's a balance between self-defense and considering the broader implications of calling the police on someone who might not be a threat. \n\nIn conclusion, while the backlash is harsh, her actions were based on fear and not racism. She's not in the wrong for calling 911 when she genuinely felt threatened. The fact that the person turned out to be innocent doesn't make her initial reaction wrong; she couldn't know that at the time. However, the situation highlights the complexities of racial profiling and the fear that can lead someone to call the police. But in terms of right or wrong, her actions were a response to perceived danger, which is understandable.\n"
