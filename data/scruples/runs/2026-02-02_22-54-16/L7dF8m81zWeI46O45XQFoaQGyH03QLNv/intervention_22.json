He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author mentioning that they free bleed, which her boyfriend is upset about. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks it's gross and that she's being childish for not using tampons. The author is upset because he's overreacting and she's been doing this for six months without any real issues except her underwear.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free bleeding. From what I know, free bleeding is a practice where a person chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads, allowing blood to flow naturally. Some women do this for personal, cultural, or feminist reasons. It's a personal choice, and while some people might find it unhygienic, others see it as a way to reject societal norms around menstruation.\n\nThe boyfriend's main issue seems to be cleanliness and potential staining. He's worried about blood getting on things even though, according to the author, it hasn't happened except on her underwear. He's also calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being dismissive of her choice. The author is upset because he's making her feel like she's wrong for her choice and is now isolating her by making her go to the spare bedroom with the cats.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: 1) The practice of free bleeding is a personal choice. 2) The boyfriend is overreacting to a situation where there hasn't been a problem. 3) The boyfriend's reaction includes name-calling and invalidating her choice. 4) The author's reaction is being upset because he's being judgmental.\n\nThe boyfriend is criticizing her for a personal choice that doesn't seem to be causing actual harm (no stains except her underwear) and is making her feel bad. He's using derogatory terms against her and isolating her by making her go to another room. That seems like the behavior of someone who is being unreasonable.\n\nThe author's choice to free bleed is her right, and unless she's causing actual issues beyond her own choice, he has no standing to criticize her. His reaction is based on his own discomfort and stereotypes, which is his problem, not hers. The fact that he's making her feel like she's wrong and is isolating her adds to the problem. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue, not hers.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
