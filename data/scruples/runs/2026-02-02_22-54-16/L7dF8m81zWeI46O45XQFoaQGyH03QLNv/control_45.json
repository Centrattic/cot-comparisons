      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let me recap the scenario. The author is talking to her boyfriend and roommate about periods. She mentions that she free bleeds, which is when someone doesn't use menstrual products and lets the blood flow naturally. Her boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and an adult for not buying tampons. He's worried about stains, even though she hasn't caused any except on her underwear. The author is upset, crying in the spare room, and he stands by his opinion, saying she's a basic white feminist being disgusting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: free bleeding is a personal choice, but the boyfriend is making moral judgments about it. The author isn't causing any actual mess, just using her own body as is. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own discomfort or preferences, not any real harm. Also, he's projecting his worries onto her, even though there's no evidence of stains. The fact that he's using derogatory terms like \"basic white girl feminist\" is a red flag, indicating his judgment is rooted in a stereotype rather than genuine concern for her well-being or a valid hygiene issue.\n\nThe roommate aspect isn't a factor here since the roommate isn't mentioned as being involved in the conflict. The main conflict is between the boyfriend and the author. The boyfriend's main argument is that free bleeding is gross and that she's affecting him by potentially staining things. But since there's been no actual stains beyond her underwear, his concern is hypothetical. His reaction seems more about his own discomfort and judgment rather than any real issue.\n\nThe author's anger is justified because her partner is criticizing her personal health choice without cause, making her feel bad for a practice that's her right to choose. The boyfriend's use of derogatory language and invalidating her feelings crosses into disrespecting her autonomy and choices. He's also not considering that free bleeding is a valid choice for some people, especially if they have financial constraints or personal preferences.\n\nSo, the boyfriend is in the wrong here for invalidating her choice, making her feel bad for something that's not causing actual problems, and using hurtful language. The author isn't wrong for being upset and defending her choice. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
