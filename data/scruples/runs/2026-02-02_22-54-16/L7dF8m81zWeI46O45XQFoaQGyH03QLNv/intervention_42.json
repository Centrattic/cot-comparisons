He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, which is a practice where someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets blood flow naturally. The author is upset because their boyfriend is criticizing her for it, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult. The boyfriend is concerned about stains and feels justified, while the author is crying and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice, often related to body autonomy, cost, or environmental concerns. The author mentions she hasn't stained anything except her underwear over six months, so maybe her practice isn't causing actual problems. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about potential future issues and maybe a cultural bias against menstruation being dirty. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. If the author is free bleeding in her own home and maintaining hygiene (like not leaving messes in shared spaces), then it's her body and her choice. The boyfriend's criticism as \"gross\" and linking it to feminism could be judgmental. Also, the fact that the boyfriend is using her financial decision to not buy tampons against her might be an issue, especially if it's a valid choice for her.\n\nThe author is getting mad at the boyfriend's reaction. Is her anger justified? If the boyfriend is making her feel bad about a personal choice that doesn't harm him, then she's not in the wrong for being upset. The boyfriend's comments about it affecting him and being a \"basic white girl feminist\" seem dismissive and possibly condescending. That criticism might be more about his own discomfort or lack of understanding rather than any real wrongdoing on her part.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are shared living spaces where her free bleeding might inadvertently cause issues. The author says she's only stained her underwear, so maybe she's being careful. The boyfriend's worry about potential future stains might be overblown, but in a shared living environment, communication is key. If she had discussed her boundaries and practices with him beforehand, maybe he could have adjusted or they could have found a compromise.\n\nBut the author didn't mention that she's not cleaning up after herself or causing actual problems. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort and possibly projecting his own biases. The term \"basic white girl feminist\" is a stereotype, implying that her stance is superficial or not genuinely progressive. That's a problematic way to frame her choice, which is about personal autonomy.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is making a personal choice that she's been doing for months without causing issues. The boyfriend's criticism is based on his own judgments and not on actual harm. The author is justified in being upset because her choice is being policed, especially in a way that's dismissive and insulting. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
