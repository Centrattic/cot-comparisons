He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a person (the author) who free bleeds and their boyfriend is upset about it. First, free bleeding is a personal choice, right? It's when someone chooses to let menstrual blood drain naturally without using products like tampons or pads. Some people do it for environmental, financial, or personal reasons.\n\nThe author mentions they haven't stained anything except their underwear in the past six months. So maybe there's no actual mess happening. The boyfriend is worried about potential stains, but according to the author, there hasn't been an issue. He's calling her gross and says she's acting like a basic white girl feminist, which seems dismissive and maybe a bit of a stereotype. He's also implying that her choice affects him because they live together, but if she's only affecting her own underwear, maybe his concerns are exaggerated.\n\nThe author is upset because he's being judgmental and it's causing emotional distress. The boyfriend's reaction might be based on his own discomfort or lack of understanding about free bleeding. The fact that he's mad about something that hasn't actually caused a problem yet could indicate that he's overreacting. Also, calling her a basic white girl feminist is a bit of a slur that might invalidate her personal choice. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he's concerned about potential future messes and wants to avoid any issues. But if the author has been doing this for six months without issues, his reaction seems unwarranted. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for free bleeding, which is a personal choice, and the boyfriend's judgment is what's causing the problem. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
