He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking about free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and a basic white girl feminist, while she's upset because she hasn't stained anything and is frustrated with his overreaction. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free bleeding. From what I know, it's a choice some people make to forgo using menstrual products like tampons or pads, which can be a personal decision based on comfort, cost, environmental reasons, or personal beliefs. It's a valid choice, though it might not be comfortable for everyone.\n\nThe author mentions that she's been doing this for 6+ months without staining anything except her underwear. The boyfriend is worried about potential stains, even though there's no history of it happening. He's also using derogatory language, calling her gross and implying that her feminist stance is the issue. His reaction seems to be based on fear of potential mess rather than actual incidents.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author is making a personal choice that affects her own comfort and expenses. However, since they live together, the boyfriend's concerns about possible messes are valid, but his response might be over-the-top. However, the way he's attacking her character (calling her gross, implying she's being a basic white feminist) is problematic. That kind of language is dismissive and insulting, which isn't okay in a healthy relationship.\n\nThe author's frustration comes from feeling that she's not in the wrong for making a personal choice and being upset about the boyfriend's overreaction. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort and fears, not her actual actions. Even though free bleeding might not be the norm in their household, the author isn't causing harm, and the boyfriend's response is aggressive and disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of responsibilities, maybe they need to find a compromise. If the author is free bleeding, perhaps she's taking steps to avoid staining, but the boyfriend's anxiety is leading him to overreact. However, the boyfriend's use of insults and the author being forced to cry in the spare room indicates a significant breakdown in communication and mutual respect.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend is likely in the wrong for his harsh and disrespectful reaction, while the author is making a personal choice that hasn't caused actual issues. The main problem is his invalidating response rather than her choice. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
