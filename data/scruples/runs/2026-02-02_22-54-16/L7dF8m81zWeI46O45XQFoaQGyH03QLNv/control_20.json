I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking about free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying it's gross and that she's not acting like an adult because she's not buying tampons. She's been doing this for six months without any stains except her underwear, but he's still upset. She's mad at him and crying in the spare room.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, free bleeding is when people choose not to use menstrual products and let blood flow naturally. It's a personal choice and part of body autonomy for some, often related to rejecting traditional feminine hygiene products or costs. The woman in the post is free bleeding and the boyfriend is criticizing her for it, calling her gross and a basic white feminist. That might be a stereotype or a dismissive comment.\n\nThe roommate is involved, so maybe the boyfriend is concerned about potential messes affecting the shared space. But the woman says she's only stained her underwear, not other items. The boyfriend's reaction seems excessive if there's no actual problem. He's worried about possible stains, but there's no evidence of past issues beyond her underwear. His reaction might be based on his own discomfort or societal norms rather than actual harm.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's making a personal choice about her body. The boyfriend's criticism is about her personal choice, which is her right. However, if there's a concern about hygiene or affecting shared spaces, maybe there's a middle ground. But the post says she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, so his worry is unfounded. His accusations that she's being gross and not adult-like are judgmental. Also, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" is a problematic stereotype, implying her choice is performative or not genuine, which is invalidating.\n\nThe author getting mad is a reaction to being criticized for her body choice. If the boyfriend is not respecting her autonomy and is being judgmental without valid reasons, then he's in the wrong. The key here is whether the boyfriend's concerns are valid. Since there's no history of stains beyond her underwear, his concerns might be overblown. The author isn't causing actual harm to him or the shared space, so her choice is her own. The boyfriend is projecting his discomfort onto her, which isn't her fault.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She has the right to make her own health decisions, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own feelings rather than actual issues. His insults and invalidation are the problem here.\n"
