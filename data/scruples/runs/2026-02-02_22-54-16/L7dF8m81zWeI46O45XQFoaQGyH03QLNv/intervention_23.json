He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for free bleeding and getting upset about her boyfriend's reaction. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets their blood flow naturally, which can involve not wearing anything to absorb it. It's a personal choice, part of body autonomy, and some people do it for environmental, financial, or personal reasons.\n\nThe author mentions that she's been doing this for over six months without staining anything except her underwear. So, she's managing it in a way that doesn't mess up the house. Her boyfriend is upset, thinking she's gross and not acting like an adult because she's not using tampons. He's worried about staining things, but the author is frustrated because he's overreacting. She's crying in the spare room, feeling hurt by his comments about her being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and calling her disgusting.\n\nSo, the main points are about body autonomy and the partner's reaction. The boyfriend is dismissing her choices, which could be a form of emotional abuse or invalidation. The author is standing up for her right to make her own decisions about her body. The boyfriend's criticism is not just about the practical aspect but is attacking her identity and choices, which is more about control or disrespect.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are wrong. Free bleeding is a personal choice and doesn't inherently harm others unless it affects them directly. Since she hasn't stained anything else, the issue is more about her partner's feelings and their dynamic. The boyfriend's response seems to be about control and judgment, which is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting her right to make her own health decisions and being upset by his invalidating comments.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
