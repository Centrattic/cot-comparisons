He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a discussion about free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, saying it's gross and that she's acting like a child for not buying tampons. The author is upset because he's overreacting, even though she hasn't stained anything except her underwear. She's also crying in the spare room, so there's emotional distress involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice some women make, often related to body autonomy or financial reasons. The boyfriend is expressing his concerns about possible messes and calling her actions gross. The author feels insulted and thinks he's overreacting. \n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. The author mentioned this casually, so maybe she didn't expect such a strong reaction. The boyfriend's reaction is causing tension, but is his concern valid? If she hasn't actually caused any messes, his worry might be unfounded. However, living together does require considering each other's comfort. \n\nBut wait, the author is making a choice that's her own body, and the boyfriend is judging her for it, which can be a form of body shaming. He's also comparing her to a \"basic white girl feminist\" which is a derogatory term suggesting she's doing it for attention rather than personal reasons. That's pretty harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that the topic was brought up in a shared space (with the roommate), so he's concerned about potential messes affecting their home environment. However, if she's been doing this for 6 months without issues, his reaction seems excessive. \n\nThe main issue here is the boyfriend's judgment and invalidation of her choice, which is a personal decision. The author isn't wrong for wanting body autonomy and being upset at being called gross. The boyfriend's response is more problematic because he's attacking her motives and not respecting her choice, even if he has concerns about cleanliness.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
