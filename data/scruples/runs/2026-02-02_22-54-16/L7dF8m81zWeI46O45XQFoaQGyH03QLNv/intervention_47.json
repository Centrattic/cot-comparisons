He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a person who free bleeds and their boyfriend being upset about it. The author is getting mad at the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, free bleeding is a practice where someone chooses not to use menstrual products and allows their blood to flow naturally. It's a personal choice and can be part of body autonomy or financial decisions. However, the boyfriend is upset, claiming it's gross and affecting him. \n\nThe author mentions that they haven't stained anything beyond their underwear for six months. So, maybe there's a lack of actual incidents causing a problem. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his discomfort or perception rather than any real harm. \n\nThe boyfriend accuses the author of being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which might be a dismissive comment, possibly a stereotype. That could be a point against him. The author is upset and crying, feeling justified in their anger. \n\nThe key factors here are consent, personal choice, and the impact on others. If the author is taking precautions to prevent staining and not affecting others, then the boyfriend's objection might be about his own feelings rather than actual harm. The author's right to make choices about their body is important here. \n\nHowever, living together might require some compromise. The author should consider if their actions, even if they haven't caused issues, might make the boyfriend uncomfortable. But free bleeding is a personal choice, and unless it's causing a mess or health issues, the boyfriend's reaction could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe boyfriend's comments about the author's financial decision (not buying tampons) might also touch on class judgments, which isn't fair. The author might be making a conscious choice for various reasons, including cost, and shouldn't be shamed for that. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it seems like they are not, as long as they are managing their period in a way that doesn't affect others. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort and possibly misunderstandings or judgment. The author's anger is a valid response to being accused of being gross and dismissed. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
