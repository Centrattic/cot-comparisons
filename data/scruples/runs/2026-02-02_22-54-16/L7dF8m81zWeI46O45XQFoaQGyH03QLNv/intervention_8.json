He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves the author free bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets blood flow naturally. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's being gross and not acting like an adult because she's not spending money on tampons. The author is upset because he's overreacting, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. The roommate is also involved in the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what free bleeding entails. It's a personal choice, often related to body autonomy, cost, or environmental reasons. It's not illegal, but it can be a sensitive topic, especially in shared living spaces. The boyfriend's reaction is about potential mess and his discomfort with the idea. He's worried about staining things even though it hasn't happened yet. The author is frustrated because he's making her feel bad for her choice and calling her names like a \"basic white girl feminist\" and \"disgusting.\"\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's right to make her own health choices versus the boyfriend's concerns about cleanliness and shared space. The boyfriend is not the one making the choice to free bleed; he's reacting to it. The author is within her rights to make that choice, but maybe there's a communication issue here. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh and judgmental. He's dismissing her reasons and attacking her character. That kind of behavior can be toxic in a relationship.\n\nThe author is getting mad because he's being critical, and she's upset. He's invalidating her choice, which is a personal health decision. The fact that she's been doing it for six months without incident suggests that she's managing it well. The boyfriend's anxiety about potential mess isn't unreasonable, but his response is out of proportion and disrespectful. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about his reaction. He's crossing the line into bullying by calling her names and making her feel bad for her choice.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend is overreacting and being disrespectful. The author has the right to make her own health choices, and his reaction is the issue here.\n"
