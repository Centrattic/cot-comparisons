He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author mentions she free bleeds, which is a choice to not use menstrual products and let blood flow freely. Her boyfriend is upset about it, calling her gross and not an adult because she's saving money by not buying tampons. The boyfriend is worried about blood getting on things, even though she hasn't stained anything except her underwear. The author is upset and crying, and he says she's a \"basic white girl feminist\" and disgusting. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's a personal choice some people make, often for reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or rejecting the stigma around menstruation. It's not uncommon, but it can be controversial because of societal norms around cleanliness and menstruation.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be a mix of disgust and concern for property. He's worried about stains and is upset that she's making him live with this. But the author hasn't actually caused any damage beyond her underwear, so his fear might be exaggerated. He's also making personal attacks, calling her names and implying her feminism is performative. That's pretty harsh.\n\nThe author is getting mad at him for being upset. Is she in the wrong? Well, her choice to free bleed is her body, her right. Unless there's a specific reason it's causing actual problems (like staining shared items), she's within her rights to do so. The boyfriend's overreaction and name-calling seem to be the issue here. He might not be respecting her autonomy and is projecting his own discomfort onto her. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact is significant. She's crying in the spare room, which suggests he's being emotionally abusive. The fact that he's using terms like \"basic white girl feminist\" is dismissive and possibly a stereotype, which isn't helpful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She has the right to make her own choices about her body, and her boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort and judgment rather than any actual harm she's causing. His behavior is the problem here, not hers.\n"
