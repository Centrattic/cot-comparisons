He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong in a situation where she free bleeds and her boyfriend is upset about it. The author is upset because her boyfriend is making her feel like she's being gross and not acting like an adult by not using tampons. She's been free bleeding for six months without any issues except for her underwear, but her boyfriend is still upset about the possibility of staining things. The roommate is also involved in the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding means. From what I know, free bleeding is a practice where a person chooses not to use menstrual products like pads or tampons, allowing their menstrual blood to flow naturally. Some people do this for personal, feminist, or environmental reasons. It's a personal choice, but it can be controversial because of hygiene concerns, especially in shared living spaces.\n\nThe author mentions that she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. That might be a point in her favor because there's no evidence of actual mess. However, her boyfriend's concern is about the potential for future stains, which he finds unacceptable. The key here is whether her choice is unreasonable given their living situation.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset enough that he's called her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and called her disgusting, leading to the author crying. That seems like a harsh reaction. The boyfriend is making personal attacks instead of discussing the issue calmly. If the author is free bleeding in a way that doesn't affect him (only her underwear), then his reaction might be overblown. However, if there's a risk that her actions could affect shared spaces or the roommate's feelings, that might be a valid concern.\n\nThe roommate is part of the conversation, so maybe the boyfriend is considering the roommate's comfort as well. But if the author is taking steps to prevent staining (like only using her underwear), then the concern might be unfounded. It's also possible that the boyfriend is being overly controlling or not respecting her personal choice, especially if she's been doing this for months without issues.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The author mentions she doesn't want to spend money on tampons. If she's making a choice based on cost, that's her decision, but if it's affecting others, that's a different story. However, since there's no actual problem yet, maybe the boyfriend is being too critical without cause.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is wrong, it depends on the impact. If her actions are not causing harm to others, then she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be the problem here. He's making personal attacks and not addressing the issue constructively. The author's frustration is valid because she's being accused of being gross without a real reason. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's behavior seems more problematic, especially with the name-calling and lack of constructive dialogue. The author has a right to her personal choice as long as it doesn't harm others, and since there's no evidence of actual issues beyond her underwear, his reaction is unwarranted.\n"
