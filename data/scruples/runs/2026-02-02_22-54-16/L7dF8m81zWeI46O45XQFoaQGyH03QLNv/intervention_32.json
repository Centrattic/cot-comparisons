He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author mentioning that she free bleeds, which is when someone doesn't use menstrual products and lets the blood flow out naturally. Her boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she's not buying tampons. He's worried about her bleeding on things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. She's upset and crying in the spare room, and he's defending his stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Free bleeding is a personal choice and a valid form of menstrual hygiene for some people, especially if they can manage it without causing issues. The author hasn't had any accidents except her underwear, so maybe she's managing it okay. But her boyfriend is concerned about potential messes, which is understandable if they live together. However, his reaction seems harsh\u2014calling her gross and a basic white girl feminist might be dismissive of her choice and her autonomy.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect in a shared living space. The author's choice is hers, and unless it's causing actual problems beyond her underwear, it's her body and her decision. The boyfriend's overreaction could be seen as invalidating her choice and making her feel shamed. The fact that she's crying and he's still being defensive raises red flags about his behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, in a shared living situation, there's an expectation of considering others' comfort. But the author hasn't caused any issues beyond her own underwear, so maybe the boyfriend is overreacting. His use of terms like \"basic white girl feminist\" is also problematic as it's a stereotype and could be a form of gaslighting or belittlement.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's choice is her right, and the boyfriend is overstepping by criticizing her and making her feel bad. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
