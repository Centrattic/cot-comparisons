He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole in the given situation. The question involves a conflict between a boyfriend and the author regarding her choice to free bleed. Free bleeding is a personal choice some women make for various reasons, including cost or environmental concerns. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions she's been free bleeding for over six months without causing any mess except for her underwear. The boyfriend is upset about potential stains, but there's no evidence that she's actually caused any issues beyond that. His reaction seems more about his anxiety or discomfort rather than any real problem.\n\nThe boyfriend's arguments are that she's being gross and not acting like an adult by not buying tampons. The author is upset because he's making her feel bad about her choice, which she sees as a personal matter. He's also accusing her of being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which might be a dismissive comment and could be seen as invalidating her reasons.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, personal choice, and mutual respect. Free bleeding is a valid choice for some people. The boyfriend's reaction is based on his own preferences and fears, not on any actual harm she's caused. If he's not comfortable with it, a respectful approach would be to discuss the issue calmly and find a compromise, like designating specific areas for free bleeding or using alternative methods if possible. However, his response seems hostile and judgmental, which is not constructive.\n\nThe author's anger is a natural reaction to being criticized for a personal choice that hasn't caused real problems. His labeling her as a \"basic white girl feminist\" is also a derogatory term that undermines her autonomy. The emotional impact is significant, leading her to cry in the spare room, which shows the harm caused by his words.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's choices, provided they don't harm the other. Since free bleeding here hasn't affected him beyond his anxiety, the boyfriend's overreaction is the main issue. The author isn't in the wrong for defending her choice and feeling upset about his judgmental attitude. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
