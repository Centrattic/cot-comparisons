He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which I know is a personal choice some women make, not using menstrual products. The author mentions doing this for six months without staining anything except her underwear. The boyfriend is upset about the potential for staining and calls her gross and a \"basic white girl feminist.\" She's upset and in the spare room crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal health choice and can be a feminist stance for some, rejecting the commercialization of menstrual products. The author isn't causing harm beyond the boyfriend's concerns about stains. She's only stained her underwear, which seems manageable. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate\u2014getting angry about a potential problem that hasn't actually caused issues. He's also using derogatory language, calling her gross and making a comment about her identity, which is hurtful.\n\nThe key points are whether her actions are harmful. Since she hasn't actually stained anything else, his worries might be overblown. His response is more about his feelings rather than any real damage. The author's anger at being criticized for her choice seems justified. The boyfriend's argument about affecting him by living there is weak because the issue hasn't materialized beyond his anxiety. Also, the term \"basic white girl feminist\" is dismissive and could be a form of gaslighting or belittlement, which is problematic.\n\nSo, considering personal autonomy and the lack of actual harm, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort and perhaps misunderstanding of her choice. The answer should be B.\n"
