He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author is free-bleeding, which means they don't use menstrual products like tampons or pads and instead let the blood flow naturally. The boyfriend is upset about this, saying it's gross and that the author isn't acting like an adult because they don't buy tampons. The boyfriend is worried about staining things, even though the author hasn't actually stained anything except their underwear. The author is upset because the boyfriend is overreacting and even called them a \"basic white girl feminist\" and called them disgusting. Now the author is crying in the spare bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free-bleeding is a personal choice and is part of some feminist activism or body autonomy movements. People have different views on this; some see it as a valid personal choice, others might see it as messy or unhygienic. The boyfriend's reaction is about cleanliness and potential mess, but the author hasn't caused any actual issues beyond maybe a little mess in their underwear. The boyfriend's criticism might be coming from a place of discomfort or misunderstanding. \n\nThe key points here are: the author is free-bleeding, the boyfriend is upset about it, and the author is getting mad at him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they are not causing any real harm except maybe a little mess in their underwear. They might feel that their personal choice is being policed by their partner. On the other hand, the boyfriend is concerned about potential mess and cleanliness, which is a valid concern in a shared living space. However, his reaction seems exaggerated since there hasn't been any actual staining beyond the underwear. Also, calling the author names like \"disgusting\" and implying that their feminism is \"basic white girl\" is dismissive and possibly invalidating.\n\nSo, the author's choice to free-bleed is their personal right. The boyfriend's reaction is over the top, especially if there's no real issue. The author getting upset at the boyfriend's criticism is understandable because he's attacking their personal choice and using judgmental language. The boyfriend isn't respecting the author's autonomy and is making her feel bad, which is not acceptable in a relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to make personal health decisions, and the boyfriend's reaction is the problem here.\n"
