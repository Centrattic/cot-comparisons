He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and her boyfriend about free bleeding. The author mentions she does this casually during a conversation with her boyfriend and roommate. Her boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and implying she's not an adult because she doesn't buy tampons. The author is now upset and living with the boyfriend, but hasn't stained anything except her underwear. She's crying in the spare room, and the boyfriend feels justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products, allowing menstrual blood to flow freely. It's a personal choice often linked to body autonomy, cost, environmental concerns, or other reasons. The author has been doing this for six months without causing issues beyond her underwear, so maybe she's managing it well. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since there's no mention of actual problems beyond his anxiety. He's projecting his discomfort onto her, calling her choices disgusting, which can be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe roommate is involved in the conversation, so the author is sharing her personal habits in a shared living space. The boyfriend is worried about her bleeding on things, but if she's been careful and only stained her underwear, maybe his fears are exaggerated. His accusation that she's a \"basic white girl feminist\" sounds dismissive and possibly a stereotype, which is not helpful. The author is upset because he's invalidating her choice and making her feel bad about it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about bodily autonomy versus shared living space concerns. The author isn't causing harm, so her choice shouldn't be judged harshly. The boyfriend's overreaction and the use of derogatory labels suggest he's in the wrong. However, if the living situation is shared and the boyfriend is legitimately uncomfortable, maybe there's a middle ground. But since the author has managed it without issues for six months, his concerns might not be valid. Plus, he's not just upset but making her feel like an asshole, which is extreme. The author's anger here is a reaction to being insulted and dismissed, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
