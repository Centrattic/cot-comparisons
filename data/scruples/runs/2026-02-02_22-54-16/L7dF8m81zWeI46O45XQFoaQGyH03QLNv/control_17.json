He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves free bleeding, which is a choice some people make for various reasons, like cost or personal preference. The author mentions they've been doing this for six months without causing a mess, except for their underwear. The boyfriend is upset, saying it's gross and that he's worried about stains. He even accuses her of being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and calls her disgusting. The author is upset and crying, feeling justified in getting mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice and a valid health decision. It's not inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his discomfort or potential cleanup than actual harm caused. The author hasn't stained anything beyond her underwear, so the practical issue might be minimal. His framing of it as a feminist issue (\"basic white girl feminist\") could be a way to dismiss her choice based on stereotypes, which is problematic. The fact that he's upset about something she's done for six months without real issues suggests his reaction is more about his own feelings than an actual problem.\n\nThe key points here are personal autonomy and mutual respect in a relationship. The boyfriend is overreacting by calling her choices gross and using derogatory language. The author has the right to make decisions about her own body. His behavior seems to belittle her valid choice and dismiss her feelings. The author's anger is a reasonable response to being insulted and judged for a personal health decision. There's no evidence she's caused real harm beyond his expectations. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
