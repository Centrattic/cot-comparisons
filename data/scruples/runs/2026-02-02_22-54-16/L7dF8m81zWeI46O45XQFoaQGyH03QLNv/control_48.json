I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation is about free bleeding and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice, and there's no inherent wrongness in it, even though it's a matter of personal preference. The author mentions that they've been doing it for six months without causing any mess except for their underwear. So, from a practical standpoint, maybe there's no real issue except the boyfriend's feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset because he's worried about potential stains and is calling her behavior gross and childish. He's also making a comment about her being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds dismissive and possibly condescending. That's a red flag because he's attacking her character and beliefs rather than discussing the issue calmly.\n\nThe author is upset because he's overreacting and she's being criticized for a choice that doesn't seem to affect him directly, except for his anxiety about possible stains. She's also crying and feeling isolated, which indicates emotional distress. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if there's no actual mess caused. Insisting that she's being gross for not spending money on tampons could be seen as prioritizing his comfort over her autonomy in a personal health matter.\n\nHowever, it's also true that living situations require compromise. If free bleeding does pose a risk of staining shared spaces, even if it hasn't happened yet, the boyfriend might have valid concerns. But his response is more about anger and judgment rather than addressing the issue practically. He's not offering solutions or understanding, just criticizing her and making her feel like an asshole.\n\nSo, the main factors here are the boyfriend's overreaction, the dismissive and derogatory comments, and the author's right to make her own health decisions. The boyfriend isn't in the right for how he's handling the situation. The author isn't wrong for being upset about his reaction and for standing by her choice. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
