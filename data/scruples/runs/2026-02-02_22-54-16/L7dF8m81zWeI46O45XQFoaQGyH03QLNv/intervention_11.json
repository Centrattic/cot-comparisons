He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, which is a choice some people make for various reasons, including cost or personal preference. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and acting like a child because she doesn't buy tampons. She's been free bleeding for six months without issues except for her underwear.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if free bleeding is a personal choice that others might have opinions about, but it's a legal and personal decision. The boyfriend is making moral judgments about her choice, calling her gross and a basic white feminist. That seems like a judgmental stance. The fact that she's been doing it without causing problems beyond her underwear suggests she's managing it responsibly. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his discomfort or stigma around menstruation rather than any real harm caused. The author is upset because he's invalidated her choice, which is a valid emotional response. So, the boyfriend's behavior might be the issue here, not the author's. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
