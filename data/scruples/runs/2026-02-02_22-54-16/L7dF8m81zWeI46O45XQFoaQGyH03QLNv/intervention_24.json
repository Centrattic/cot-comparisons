I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author free-bleeding, which means not using menstrual products and allowing blood to flow freely. She mentions this casually to her boyfriend and roommate, and her boyfriend is upset about it. He's worried about staining things and criticizes her for being gross and not acting like an adult because she's not spending money on tampons. The author feels insulted and is upset, crying in the spare room.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she's not wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, free-bleeding is a personal choice. Many women choose it for various reasons, like cost, environmental concerns, or personal comfort. It's a valid decision, though it might not be comfortable for everyone. The key here is whether the author's actions are affecting others. She says she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, which suggests she's managing it responsibly. The boyfriend's concern seems to be about potential future accidents or stains, but there's no mention of actual harm yet.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is what's causing the conflict. He's calling her gross and implying that her decision is affecting him by making him live in a potentially messy environment. However, if she's been doing this for 6 months without issues, his reaction might be overblown. His criticism could be rooted in his own discomfort or lack of understanding about her choice, rather than an actual problem.\n\nThe term \"basic white girl feminist\" is a derogatory term often used to mock feminists who are seen as privileged or not taking intersectionality into account. Using that label is dismissive and could be part of the issue here. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own biases or lack of empathy rather than a valid concern.\n\nThe author's right to make choices about her body is important. Unless her free-bleeding is causing direct harm or mess that affects others, she's within her rights. The boyfriend's criticism seems to be about his own discomfort rather than an actual problem. The fact that she's upset and crying shows the emotional impact of his words, which adds to the argument that he's in the wrong here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for making a personal health choice that hasn't caused actual harm. The boyfriend's reaction is based on his own discomfort and judgment rather than a legitimate issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
