I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking about free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. She mentions that she doesn't want to spend money on tampons and that she's been doing it for six months without staining anything except her underwear. Her boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and acting like a basic white feminist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets blood flow naturally. It's a personal choice and part of body autonomy for some people. The author is upset because her boyfriend is judging her for it and making her feel like she's being disgusting. He's also worried about potential stains, even though she hasn't had any issues in six months.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend is concerned about hygiene and potential mess, which is understandable. But on the other hand, the author is making a personal choice about her body and is within her rights to do so. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his discomfort or judgment rather than any actual harm caused. The author isn't causing real problems except for the boyfriend's emotional reaction.\n\nI should also think about the dynamics here. The boyfriend is framing her choice as something negative, calling her a basic white feminist, which sounds like an attack on her identity or beliefs. The author is crying and feeling isolated, which points to emotional distress. The boyfriend's reaction might be based on his own biases or lack of understanding about body autonomy. The author isn't the one causing physical harm here; she's just making a personal choice that others might find uncomfortable but isn't inherently wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. She mentions not wanting to spend money on tampons, which could be a valid reason for her, especially if she's making a conscious decision to reduce expenses. However, the boyfriend argues that it affects him because they live together. But unless she's causing actual damage or creating a health hazard, his concerns might be overblown. It's about respecting personal choices versus shared living spaces.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's had no issues in six months except for her underwear suggests that she's managing it well. The boyfriend's fear of future stains is speculative, and his anger is based on that fear rather than any real incidents. That could indicate his lack of trust in her ability to handle her own hygiene. \n\nIn terms of social norms, free bleeding is a controversial topic. Some people support it as a feminist act, while others criticize it. The boyfriend's use of the term \"basic white feminist\" might be a dismissal of her choice, which can be seen as invalidating her autonomy. The author's anger is a response to being judged and criticized for her valid personal decision.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing free bleeding. Her boyfriend's reaction is based on judgment and not on any actual harm. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
