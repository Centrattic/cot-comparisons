      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's free bleeding, which means she's not using tampons or pads and just lets her menstrual blood flow out naturally, catching it with a menstrual cup or something. She mentions this casually while talking with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she's not spending money on tampons. He's worried about her bleeding on things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear in the past six months. She's upset and crying in the spare bedroom, feeling like he's being justified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free bleeding. From what I know, it's a personal choice some people make for various reasons\u2014environmental, financial, or personal comfort. It's not harmful, but it's a lifestyle choice that might be misunderstood or seen as unhygienic by others. The key here is whether her choice is reasonable and if her boyfriend has a valid reason to be upset.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that she's gross and not acting like an adult because she's not using tampons. But if she's free bleeding and has been doing so without causing any mess, maybe his concern is unfounded. The fact that she hasn't stained anything except her underwear suggests that she's managing it properly. His worry about potential accidents might be overblown, especially since it's been six months without issues. Also, he's calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" which sounds like an insulting stereotype and dismissive of her reasons for free bleeding.\n\nThe roommate is mentioned as part of the conversation, but the main conflict is between the author and her boyfriend. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his personal discomfort or societal norms rather than actual hygiene issues. If free bleeding is her choice and she's not causing harm or mess, then his judgment might be unfair. His dismissal of her reasons and the way he's making her feel (calling her names and making her cry) indicates that he's being disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a valid concern about potential messes. But if she's been doing it for six months without issues, his reaction is based on fear rather than reality. The boyfriend's argument that it affects him because he lives there is a bit of a stretch unless she's actually causing him problems. Since the only stain is her underwear, which is her responsibility, his anger seems misplaced.\n\nThe author's frustration is justified because she's defending her personal choice, which is a valid right. The boyfriend's insults and overreaction are not appropriate, especially using a derogatory stereotype. The emotional response from the author (crying, feeling isolated) points to his behavior being hurtful and controlling.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
