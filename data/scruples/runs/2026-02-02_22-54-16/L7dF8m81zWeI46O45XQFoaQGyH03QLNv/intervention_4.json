He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author mentioned free bleeding to her boyfriend and roommate, and now her boyfriend is upset. He thinks it's gross and that she's acting like a basic white girl feminist. She's crying and feels he's justified in his anger.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets the blood flow out naturally, which is a personal choice and can be part of feminist or body autonomy movements. The boyfriend is upset about potential stains and thinks she's being gross. The roommate might also be involved here. \n\nThe key points are: the author has been free bleeding for 6 months without staining anything except her underwear. The boyfriend is worried about stains and calls her a basic white girl feminist, which is a derogatory term implying she's doing it for attention rather than genuine reasons. The author is upset and feels he's being unfair.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, is it reasonable for her to free bleed in her home? She's not causing actual damage beyond her underwear, which is part of menstruation. The boyfriend's issue seems to be about potential future stains and his discomfort. But she's been doing it for 6 months without incident, so maybe his concerns are exaggerated. \n\nThe term \"basic white girl feminist\" is a stereotype used to dismiss women's feminist views, especially those who focus on issues like menstrual health without supporting broader feminist causes. If he's using that term, it's an ad hominem attack, which isn't constructive. \n\nThe author's actions are within her rights in her own home. Unless there's a specific agreement about cleanliness that's being violated, free bleeding shouldn't be a problem. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his personal discomfort and assumptions rather than actual harm. \n\nShe's getting angry because he's criticizing her for a personal choice that doesn't affect him directly (other than possible stains, which she's managed so far). His reaction might stem from a lack of understanding or stigma around menstruation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, she's making a choice that's her right to do, especially if it's part of her body autonomy. The boyfriend should respect that unless there's a valid reason (like actual stains causing issues). Since she hasn't had any, his anxiety might be unfounded. \n\nThe author's being upset is justified because her personal choice is being attacked with a derogatory term, and she's being accused of being gross without cause. The boyfriend's response is dismissive and disrespectful. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her choice is personal and she's not causing harm, while the boyfriend's reaction is based on stigma and disrespect.\n"
