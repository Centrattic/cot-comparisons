I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about free bleeding, which I know is a practice where some people choose not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads. The author mentioned this casually to her boyfriend and their roommate. The boyfriend took offense, calling her gross and implying she's not acting like an adult. The author is upset because she feels he's overreacting, especially since she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear in the past 6 months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's choice to free bleed is a personal one, and she might have valid reasons, like financial constraints. The boyfriend is concerned about potential mess and cleanliness, but the author hasn't caused any actual problems yet. He's reacting emotionally, which might be valid if he's genuinely uncomfortable, but it's also possible he's overreacting.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. If the author is free bleeding in her own home and not affecting others, perhaps the boyfriend's reaction is about his own discomfort rather than a real issue. However, since they live together, hygiene and shared spaces matter. The boyfriend might feel that the risk of staining shared items is a problem, even if it hasn't happened yet.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is getting mad because the boyfriend is criticizing her personal choice. He's also making a judgment about her being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds dismissive and possibly sexist. That could be the real issue here\u2014he's not just concerned about cleanliness but also belittling her for making a different choice.\n\nThe roommate's perspective isn't clear, but maybe they don't have a problem with it. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own feelings rather than any actual harm caused. The author's distress is valid because she's being criticized for her body choices, which can be a sensitive topic.\n\nI think the boyfriend is overreacting by making it a big deal and using derogatory language. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing a method that works for her, as long as it's within her own space and not affecting others. The boyfriend should respect her choice unless there's a valid reason related to shared living conditions. But since there's no actual mess, his reaction is more about his own discomfort and judgment. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
