He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about free bleeding, which is a choice some people make where they don't use menstrual products like tampons or pads, letting the blood flow naturally. The person is upset because their boyfriend is criticizing them for it, saying it's gross and that he's worried about staining things. The author feels insulted and is now in the spare bedroom crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice and can be part of a feminist stance for some, rejecting the idea that periods are shameful or need to be hidden. The boyfriend is upset about potential stains and thinks the author is being gross. But the author mentions that they haven't actually stained anything except their underwear in the past six months. So maybe the boyfriend is overreacting based on fear rather than actual incidents.\n\nNow, the author is getting mad at the boyfriend for his reaction. They feel insulted when he calls them a \"basic white girl feminist\" and says they're disgusting. The boyfriend is also implying that the author's choice affects him because they live together. But free bleeding in the privacy of one's home shouldn't inherently affect others unless there's a mess beyond the person's own belongings. If the author is careful enough not to stain anything else, then the boyfriend's worry might be unfounded.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. If the boyfriend didn't agree with the author's choice, he should have discussed it calmly instead of criticizing and making personal attacks. The author has a right to make choices about their body, and the boyfriend's reaction seems more about his discomfort or societal norms than actual harm. The author getting upset in response is justified because they feel disrespected and attacked. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground where both parties can agree on some boundaries. But based on the information given, the author isn't causing actual problems, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own feelings than any real issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset; the boyfriend's behavior seems more problematic here.\n"
