I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author free-bleeding, which means not using period products like tampons or pads. She mentions this to her boyfriend and roommate, and her boyfriend is upset, thinking she's being gross and not acting mature because she's not buying tampons. The author is upset with him for being so worked up about potential stains, even though she hasn't actually caused any issues in the past six months. He's called her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and that she's being disgusting. She's now crying in the spare room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Free-bleeding is a personal choice, and some people choose not to use products for various reasons, including cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. However, the boyfriend is concerned about potential mess and cleanliness. The author might feel that her choice is being policed, while the boyfriend might feel that his living environment is at risk. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. If the author's free-bleeding doesn't actually cause a problem and she's taking care to avoid stains, maybe the boyfriend's reaction is over the top. But if he's genuinely uncomfortable with it and they haven't found a compromise, there might be a communication issue. \n\nThe boyfriend's comment about her being a \"basic white girl feminist\" is problematic because it's a stereotype and dismissive. That's probably not okay. The author getting upset over that is valid because being called a stereotype is hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author mentioned the issue casually. Maybe she didn't consider how it would affect him. But if she's been doing it for six months without issues, his reaction could be seen as excessive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's making a personal choice that doesn't seem to harm anyone, and his reaction is harsh. The boyfriend's comments are more concerning because they're derogatory. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
