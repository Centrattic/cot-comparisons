He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a discussion about free bleeding with a boyfriend and a roommate. The author mentions they free bleed, the boyfriend is upset, saying it's gross and that they're not acting like an adult. The author is upset and feels wronged, while the boyfriend is frustrated that they're not using tampons and is worried about staining things. The author is crying in the spare room with their cats.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, free bleeding is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads, allowing blood to flow naturally. It's a personal choice, often related to bodily autonomy, cost, or environmental concerns. The author might have valid reasons for this choice.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset because he thinks it's gross and that it affects him since he lives there. But the author hasn't stained anything except their underwear. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his discomfort, but the author isn't causing any actual harm beyond his personal feelings. The boyfriend also accuses the author of being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds like a derogatory term implying that their activism is performative or not genuine. That's a serious accusation and could be contributing to the conflict.\n\nThe roommate is mentioned, but the main conflict is between the author and the boyfriend. The boyfriend is invalidating the author's choice, which is a personal decision. The author's anger comes from feeling judged and insulted. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his own hygiene preferences, but the author is within their rights to make their own choices unless there's a health or safety issue. Since there's no mention of actual stains or problems beyond the boyfriend's anxiety, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's accusation about being a performative feminist is also problematic and contributes to the conflict.\n\nSo, the key points are: personal choice in bodily autonomy, the boyfriend's judgment without valid reason, the accusation of being a performative activist, and the emotional impact on the author. Since the author isn't causing actual harm and the boyfriend is making personal judgments, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
