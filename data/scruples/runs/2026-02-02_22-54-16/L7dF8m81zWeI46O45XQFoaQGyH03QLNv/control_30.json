He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is a choice some people make to not use menstrual products and instead let their blood flow naturally. The author is upset because her boyfriend is criticizing her for this, calling her gross and not an adult because she doesn't buy tampons. He's worried about staining things even though there's been no issues except for her underwear. The author is crying and feels her boyfriend is being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice and can be related to body autonomy. The author isn't causing issues beyond her own underwear, so maybe the boyfriend is overreacting. However, the boyfriend's concern about cleanliness and shared living space might be valid. The question is whether the author's actions are unreasonable given that they don't affect others beyond her own hygiene.\n\nThen, the boyfriend's behavior. He's upset that she's free bleeding and is threatening to get angry if there's a stain. He's making her feel bad by calling her names and implying she's being disgusting. That seems harsh, especially if there's no real issue. The author's reaction to get mad is understandable if he's being disrespectful towards her personal choice. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's comment about her being a \"basic white girl feminist\" is a bit of a stereotype and could be dismissive of her reasons for free bleeding. That might be a form of invalidating her decision, which is not helpful. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong if her actions don't interfere with others and she's standing up for her personal choices. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort and projection, which isn't her responsibility. Hence, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
