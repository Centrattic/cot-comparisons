He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole in the situation described. The author mentions free bleeding, which is a choice some people make for various reasons, like cost or environmental concerns. The boyfriend is upset about it, thinking she's being gross and not acting like an adult. He's worried about staining things even though she hasn't actually done so in six months. The roommate is also involved in the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if free bleeding is a valid personal choice. Many people choose to free bleed as a form of protest against menstrual products or due to financial reasons. It can be a feminist stance for some. However, the boyfriend's concern is about potential mess and maybe discomfort. The key here is whether the author's choice is unreasonable given their living situation. \n\nThe boyfriend is making a big deal about it, even though there's no actual problem except for the underwear. He's using the term \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds dismissive and possibly belittling. That's a red flag. His reaction seems more about his own discomfort than any real harm caused. The author is upset because her choice is being criticized, and she's being accused of being gross without valid reason. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is crying and feeling justified in her anger suggests emotional distress. The boyfriend is not considering her autonomy and is overreacting. The roommate's involvement in the initial conversation might have escalated things, but the main issue is between the author and the boyfriend. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't the asshole here. Her choice is personal and her reaction to being criticized is valid. The boyfriend's behavior is more problematic because he's attacking her choice without a real issue and making her feel bad. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
