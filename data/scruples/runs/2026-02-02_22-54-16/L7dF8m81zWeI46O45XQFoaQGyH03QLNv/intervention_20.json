He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for free-bleeding. They mentioned doing this casually with their boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, calling it gross and saying it's affecting him because he lives there. The author is upset and crying in the spare room.\n\nFirst, free-bleeding is a personal choice. Some people choose it for various reasons, including cost, environmental concerns, or body positivity. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his discomfort or beliefs about hygiene. But is that enough to make the author wrong? \n\nThe key points here are consent and shared living space. The author didn't force others to be part of this; they mentioned it casually. However, the boyfriend might feel his living environment is compromised. But free-bleeding itself isn't a public health issue if done hygienically. The author hasn't stained anything except their underwear, so maybe the boyfriend's concerns are unfounded.\n\nThe boyfriend's comments about \"basic white girl feminism\" come off as dismissive and judgmental. That could be a toxic attitude. The author's reaction to being called gross and dismissed is valid. Emotional reactions like crying in the spare room are hurtful, but they don't necessarily mean the author is wrong. \n\nShared living spaces require mutual respect and communication. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable, he should address it respectfully. But criticizing someone for a personal health choice and making them feel bad for it isn't right. The author's choice isn't harming others beyond the boyfriend's feelings, which are subjective. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his personal discomfort and judgment, not the author's actions necessarily being wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
