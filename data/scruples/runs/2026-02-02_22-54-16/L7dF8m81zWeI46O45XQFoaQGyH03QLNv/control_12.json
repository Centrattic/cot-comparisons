      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThey're talking about free bleeding, which I know is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads, instead letting their period flow naturally. Their boyfriend is upset about this, saying they're gross and not acting like an adult because they don't want to spend money on tampons. The roommate is involved too. The author is currently hurt and crying in the spare room with their cats, and the boyfriend is defending his position. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should think about free bleeding. Is it a personal choice? Yes, people have different reasons for it\u2014health, cost, environmental, or personal preference. The author mentions not wanting to spend money on tampons. That's a valid reason, especially if they have financial constraints. But the boyfriend is upset about the potential mess, even though the author hasn't stained anything beyond their underwear. He's acting like it's a big deal, which might be an overreaction. But does that mean the author is in the wrong?\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that it affects him too because he lives there. So there's a shared living space, so maybe cleanliness and mutual respect are factors. However, if the author is careful and hasn't caused any issues, maybe the boyfriend is being overly concerned. He's also accused the author of being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds like a dismissive or derogatory comment. That kind of language is definitely not okay and could be contributing to the conflict.\n\nThe author is getting mad at the boyfriend for his reaction. Is that justified? If the boyfriend is belittling their choice without valid reason, then the author's frustration makes sense. But if the free bleeding is causing actual problems in the shared space, maybe there's a point to his concern. However, the author mentions that they've been doing it for six months and haven't stained anything except their underwear. So maybe the boyfriend's worries are unfounded.\n\nThe roommate is involved in the conversation, so perhaps the topic was brought up in a group setting. The author mentioned it casually, which might have been the catalyst for the boyfriend's reaction. But discussing personal health choices is normal, especially among close friends or family.\n\nThe boyfriend's response seems harsh and judgmental. Calling someone gross and implying they're not an adult is disrespectful. The author's choice, while it may be different from the norm, doesn't inherently make them an asshole if it's their personal choice and they're managing it without causing issues. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014feeling justified in being angry and making derogatory remarks\u2014is more concerning.\n\nIn terms of shared living, mutual respect is key. If the author's actions aren't causing actual problems, the boyfriend's overreaction could be the bigger issue. The author's emotional response (crying in the spare room) shows that the boyfriend's words are hurtful. The boyfriend's justification of his behavior might be the real problem here.\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their choice to free bleed is a personal one, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort or prejudice rather than any real harm. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
