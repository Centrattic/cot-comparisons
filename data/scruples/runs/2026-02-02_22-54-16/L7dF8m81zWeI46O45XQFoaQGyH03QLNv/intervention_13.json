He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation is about free bleeding, which I know is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads and instead lets their blood flow freely, using just clothing to absorb it. The author mentioned this casually while talking with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and not an adult because she's not buying tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal choice versus another person's comfort. Free bleeding is a personal choice and a valid decision for some women, often related to body autonomy, cost, or environmental reasons. However, the boyfriend is clearly disturbed by this, maybe due to cultural norms, personal discomfort with bodily fluids, or concerns about cleanliness in their shared space.\n\nThe author is upset that he's overreacting, especially since she hasn't caused any mess beyond her underwear. He even accused her of being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds like a derogatory comment, possibly intended to dismiss her choice as just a trend or ideology rather than a genuine personal decision. That accusation might be sexist or reductive.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: the boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own feelings and values rather than any real harm caused. The author isn't infringing on his rights or causing actual problems beyond his emotional discomfort. If she's free bleeding in her own home and not affecting others, his concern about staining things might be valid, but if it's not happening, then his anxiety is unfounded. The fact that she's crying and he feels justified suggests that there's a power imbalance or lack of mutual respect here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is making a personal health choice, which is her right. The boyfriend's reaction is about his discomfort, which he can't force her to change, but he's entitled to express his concerns. However, calling her gross and making personal attacks isn't healthy. The key issue here is whether the boyfriend's reaction is valid or if it's him overstepping. The author isn't wrong for standing by her choice, especially if it's her body and her home. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning because of the judgment and personal attacks. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
