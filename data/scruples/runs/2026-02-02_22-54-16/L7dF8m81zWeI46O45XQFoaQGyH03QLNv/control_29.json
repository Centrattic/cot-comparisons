I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about free bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads, allowing blood to exit the body naturally. The author mentions doing this with their boyfriend and roommate, and now the boyfriend is upset. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author says they've been free bleeding for over six months without staining anything except their underwear. The boyfriend is upset because he's worried about potential messes, even though there's no history of actual incidents. He's calling her gross and accusing her of being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which seems like a derogatory term implying she's being unnecessarily feminist. The author is upset and feels insulted, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Free bleeding is a personal choice and a form of body autonomy. The author isn't causing harm beyond the boyfriend's hypothetical concerns. The boyfriend's reaction seems based on fear rather than actual problems. If there's no history of messes, his worry might be unfounded. Additionally, he's making personal attacks about her feminism, which is disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend has valid concerns about living with someone and potential messes. However, if the author is careful and hasn't caused issues, his reaction might be overblown. The key points are about body autonomy, mutual respect, and whether the boyfriend's concerns are reasonable.\n\nThe author is getting defensive and upset because her choice is being criticized, which is a valid reaction to being called gross. The boyfriend is not respecting her choice and is instead shaming her, which isn't okay. The roommate situation might require some consideration of shared living spaces, but since there's no actual mess, the boyfriend's anger seems unwarranted.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her choice to free bleed is her body's right, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about his discomfort and shaming rather than a legitimate issue. The answer should be B for No.\n"
