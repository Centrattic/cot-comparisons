He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who free bleeds, which is menstruating without using products like tampons or pads, and their boyfriend is upset about it. The roommate is also involved in the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author mentions they've been free bleeding for six months without incidents except for their underwear. The boyfriend is upset, calling them gross and a basic white feminist, and even threatened to be angry if there's a stain. The author is crying in the spare room, feeling wronged. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants confirmation. Let's break it down. Free bleeding is a personal choice and part of body autonomy. It's a feminist issue for some because it's about rejecting societal norms and the cost of products. The boyfriend is criticizing the choice, which could be seen as invalidating. The roommate might not be in the wrong if they mentioned it casually, but the boyfriend's reaction is more toxic. \n\nHe's making personal attacks, which is not okay. The author not spending money on tampons could be a financial decision, and it's their body. The boyfriend's concern about stains is about his things, but the author hasn't actually caused issues. His overreaction and name-calling likely make him the asshole. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
