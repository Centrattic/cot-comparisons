He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The author, a woman, mentioned that she free bleeds, meaning she doesn't use menstrual products and lets her blood flow naturally. Her boyfriend is upset about this, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult. She's mad at him for being judgmental and is now in the spare room crying with her cats.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free bleeding. From what I know, it's a personal choice where some people prefer not to use tampons or pads, often for comfort, environmental, or personal reasons. It's a valid choice, but it can be messy if not managed properly. The key here is whether the author is causing a mess that affects others. She says she's only stained her underwear and nothing else, but the boyfriend is worried about potential stains, even though it hasn't happened.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his own discomfort or fear of mess. He's calling her choices into question, labeling her actions as gross and implying that she's being inconsiderate because she's living with him. But if she's been doing this for 6 months without causing any issues, his anxiety might be unfounded. Also, his comment about her being a \"basic white girl feminist\" is dismissive and could be seen as invalidating her choices. That's probably hurtful and contributes to the conflict.\n\nThe author is getting mad because he's criticizing her personal choice, which she's practiced without causing harm. She's not using his money on tampons, so it's her body and her money. His concern about future messes isn't justified if she's been careful. The fact that she's been free bleeding for so long without issues suggests she's managed it well. His reaction seems more about his own feelings rather than an actual problem.\n\nSo, the boyfriend is being judgmental and not respecting her choice. The author isn't in the wrong for getting upset about being criticized for her personal decision. He's overreacting and making it personal. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
