He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. Free bleeding is a choice some people make for various reasons, including body positivity or financial constraints.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and not an adult for not buying tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. The author is upset and crying, feeling insulted and dismissed as just a \"basic white girl feminist.\"\n\nSo, first, the author's actions: free bleeding is a personal choice. She hasn't caused harm by bleeding on others' belongings, and she's been doing it for months without issues. The boyfriend is projecting his anxiety onto her, which might be his issue, not hers. He's making personal attacks about her being gross, which could be his problem, not hers. \n\nThe author is reacting emotionally to his insults, which is a normal response. He's dismissing her feelings and labeling her, which isn't helpful. The roommate's perspective isn't clear, but the main conflict is between the author and the boyfriend.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She's making a choice that's her own, and he's overreacting. Unless she's causing actual harm, which she isn't (no stains except her own), then she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is more problematic\u2014judging her and invalidating her for personal reasons. The answer should be B.\n"
