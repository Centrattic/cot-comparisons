He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author discussing free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate, leading to arguments where the boyfriend is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free bleeding. From what I know, free bleeding is a choice some people make, often for personal, feminist, or practical reasons. It's about not using menstrual products and allowing blood to flow naturally, which can be a form of body autonomy and a rejection of the commercialization of menstrual products. So, the author isn't doing anything illegal or harmful; it's a personal choice, even if it might be uncomfortable for others.\n\nThe author mentions that she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, and she's been doing this for six months without issues. The boyfriend is upset about potential stains and calls her gross, which seems judgmental. He also accuses her of being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being disgusting. That's pretty harsh language and might indicate a double standard. Maybe he's not considering her reasons for free bleeding, which could be about autonomy and choice rather than just cost-saving.\n\nThe roommate's reaction isn't clear, but the focus is on the boyfriend. The author is upset because he's overreacting. She's crying in the spare room, which shows emotional distress. The boyfriend's argument is that it affects him living there, but if the author is maintaining cleanliness and hasn't caused actual problems, his concerns might be unfounded. It's about balancing personal choices with shared living spaces. \n\nIn a shared living situation, respecting each other's choices is important. The author isn't doing anything that directly harms or infringes on the boyfriend's rights. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about personal discomfort rather than actual issues. Also, calling someone names and dismissing their reasons as \"basic white girl feminist\" is not a respectful approach. \n\nThe author's anger is justified if the boyfriend is being dismissive and judgmental without valid reasons. It's about respecting personal boundaries and choices. Unless there's a significant health or safety issue, which isn't mentioned here, the author isn't in the wrong for making a personal choice that doesn't negatively impact others.\n"
