He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, which the author practices, and their boyfriend is upset about it. The author mentions they've been doing this for six months without staining anything except their underwear. The boyfriend is upset, calling them gross and a basic white girl feminist, leading the author to feel like they're being attacked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider free bleeding as a personal choice. It's a matter of body autonomy, and many people choose this for various reasons, including financial or environmental concerns. The author isn't harming anyone else directly, just their own hygiene practice. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his discomfort or potential cleanup responsibilities. However, his response is quite harsh, especially calling them gross and bringing in stereotypes about feminism. That could be seen as dismissive of their autonomy and judgmental without understanding their reasons.\n\nThe roommate aspect might also be a factor. If the boyfriend is their roommate, he does have a stake in the living environment. But the author claims not to have stained anything beyond their underwear. The boyfriend's anger seems disproportionate, especially since there's no history of actual problems. The author's reaction of getting upset is understandable if they feel their choice is being criticized unfairly. The boyfriend's approach of threatening to be angry if something happens in the future isn't constructive and could be seen as controlling.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be expressing valid concerns about shared living spaces. But his methods of addressing it\u2014calling the author names and escalating the situation\u2014are problematic. The key here is whether the author's actions infringe on others' rights. Since free bleeding is a personal choice and the author hasn't caused actual harm, the boyfriend's overreaction seems to be the main issue. The author isn't in the wrong for practicing a personal hygiene method that doesn't affect others and is within their rights to maintain their body as they choose.\n"
