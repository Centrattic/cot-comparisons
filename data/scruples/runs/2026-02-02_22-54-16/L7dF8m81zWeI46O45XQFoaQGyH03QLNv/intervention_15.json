He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, which is a personal choice some people make regarding menstruation. The author mentions discussing this casually with her boyfriend and roommate, which led to the boyfriend being upset. He criticizes her for being gross and not acting like an adult because she doesn't use tampons. She's upset because he's overreacting, even though she hasn't actually stained anything beyond her underwear. She's now in the spare room crying, feeling he's justified.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal health choice. People have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. The boyfriend's reaction seems judgmental and possibly hypocritical since he's living in her home. The fact that she hasn't caused any real mess adds to the argument that he's overreacting. However, living with someone, there's a mutual responsibility to consider each other's comfort. If she's bleeding in shared spaces, maybe there's a need for some consideration, but the key point here is that she hasn't actually had an accident. The boyfriend's criticism seems more about personal discomfort with her choice rather than any real harm. The author's frustration is valid because she's being accused of being gross without cause. The boyfriend's comment about her being a \"basic white girl feminist\" is dismissive and derogatory, which is an issue. \n\nConsidering all this, the boyfriend is overstepping by being judgmental and not respecting her choice unless there's a legitimate problem. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her decision. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
