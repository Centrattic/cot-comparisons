He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is talking about free bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets the blood flow naturally. The boyfriend is upset about this, saying she's gross and not an adult because she's not buying tampons. The roommate is also involved in the conversation. The user is wondering if the author is wrong for being mad at her boyfriend.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Free bleeding is a personal choice and a feminist issue for some people\u2014it's about bodily autonomy and rejecting the idea that menstruation is something to be hidden. On the other hand, the boyfriend is concerned about hygiene and potential messes in their shared living space. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions she's been doing this for 6 months and hasn't stained anything except her underwear. So maybe the boyfriend's worries are not based on actual problems but his own discomfort. He's making her feel bad for her choice, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds like an insult. That seems dismissive of her reasons and possibly invalidating her feelings.\n\nThe author's reaction is getting upset and crying, which is a natural response to being criticized and called gross. The boyfriend is using the term \"asshole\" against her, which is harsh. The roommate's reaction isn't clear, but the main conflict is between the author and her boyfriend.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about respecting personal choices versus shared living spaces. The author has the right to choose her menstrual practices, and if she's not causing a mess, the boyfriend's criticism is unwarranted. However, they live together, so maybe there's a need for compromise. But the boyfriend is not respecting her choice and is making her feel bad. That seems like the issue here.\n\nSo the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend is overreacting and not respecting her autonomy. The author's anger is justified because she's being criticized for a personal choice that isn't harming him.\n"
