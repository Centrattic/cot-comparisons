He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets their blood flow freely. The author mentions doing this and their boyfriend is upset about it, thinking it's gross and that they're not acting like an adult. The boyfriend is worried about staining things even though the author hasn't actually stained anything except their underwear. The author is upset and feels insulted, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice and part of body autonomy, which many people support as a feminist stance. The author isn't harming anyone else beyond the boyfriend's concerns. However, the boyfriend is living in the same space, so there might be valid concerns about messiness, especially if others are affected. But in this case, the author says they only stained their underwear, so maybe the boyfriend's concerns are exaggerated. \n\nNext, the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Calling someone a \"basic white girl feminist\" is a stereotype and dismissive, which isn't helpful. The fact that the author has been doing this for six months without incident suggests that their method is working. The boyfriend's anger over a hypothetical situation (staining something) that hasn't happened yet might be overreacting. \n\nOn the other hand, roommates do share living spaces, so there's a balance between personal choice and consideration for others. The author might need to consider if there's a compromise, like using a specific area for changing clothes or discussing boundaries. But the boyfriend's reaction seems more about judgment of her choice rather than actual mess. \n\nThe key points are: the author's right to make personal health decisions, the boyfriend's overreaction and derogatory comment, and whether the free bleeding is actually causing problems beyond his hypothetical fears. Since there's no evidence of real harm, the author's choice isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend's attitude is disrespectful, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset.\n"
