He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding and some conflict with her boyfriend and roommate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets the blood flow naturally. Some people do this for personal, political, or financial reasons. The author mentions not wanting to spend money on tampons, so that's her reason.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is upset. He says she's gross and not acting like an adult. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. He also called her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds like an insult. She's crying and feels wronged.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, her choice to free bleed is a personal decision. As long as she's not affecting others negatively, it's her body. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own discomfort or fears. He's making her feel bad for her choice and using name-calling. That's not okay. The roommate might be caught in the middle, but the main conflict is between her and her boyfriend.\n\nThe roommate might have different boundaries, but the author hasn't stained anything, so maybe the boyfriend's reaction is overblown. The key points are her right to make her own health decisions and his reaction being judgmental and possibly controlling. Also, using a derogatory term like that is a red flag.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. Her boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. She's not harming anyone, and his criticism is unwarranted. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
