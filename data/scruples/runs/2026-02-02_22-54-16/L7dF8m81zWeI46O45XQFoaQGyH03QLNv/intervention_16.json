He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a relationship conflict between the author, their boyfriend, and their roommate. The author mentioned casually that they practice free bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and let their blood flow freely. The boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and acting like a child for not buying tampons. He's worried about stains, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. The author is upset and crying, feeling like he's justified in his anger, while she feels it's a feminist issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider free bleeding as a personal choice. It's a valid choice for some people for various reasons, including environmental concerns, cost, or personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his discomfort or concern about potential messes, even though there's no history of actual issues. His criticism of her as being \"gross\" and a \"basic white girl feminist\" could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. Using such labels might be a way to invalidate her choice rather than addressing the actual concern about messes.\n\nThe author hasn't caused any problems by free bleeding for six months, which suggests that maybe the boyfriend's concerns are more about his feelings rather than any real harm. The fact that he's escalating the issue, making her feel guilty, and calling her names might indicate that he's overreacting. The roommate being involved in the conversation adds another layer, but it's unclear how the roommate feels about it. The key point here is mutual respect in a relationship. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable with her choice, he should communicate that respectfully rather than making her feel bad. The author's reaction of being upset is understandable if she feels disrespected. So, the boyfriend's behavior seems to be the main issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for making a personal choice and feeling upset when it's criticized disrespectfully. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
