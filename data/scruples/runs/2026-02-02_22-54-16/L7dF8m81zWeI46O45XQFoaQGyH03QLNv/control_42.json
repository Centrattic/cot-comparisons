I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in their situation. The situation is about free bleeding and the boyfriend being upset about it. The user is crying in the spare room with their cats, and the boyfriend is upset because she didn't spend money on tampons and might bleed on things.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when people choose not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads and instead let blood flow naturally. Some do it for personal, feminist, or eco-friendly reasons. The author mentions she's doing it for not spending money, but also maybe as part of a feminist stance. The boyfriend is upset, thinking she's gross and that it affects him living there. He's also called her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds like a derogatory term, suggesting he's dismissing her reasons.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend is upset because of potential mess, but she's been doing it for 6 months without issues except her underwear. He's escalating the situation by calling her names and making her feel bad. She's upset and feeling insulted. \n\nI think the boyfriend's reaction is more problematic here. The author is making a personal choice that doesn't seem to be causing actual harm, just his discomfort. The boyfriend's judgment and name-calling are what's causing the conflict. He's projecting his own feelings onto her, saying she's affecting him by her choice, but it's her body and her decision. Unless there's a valid health or safety issue, which isn't mentioned, his reaction seems over the top. The fact that she's crying and feeling invalidated suggests that his response is hurtful. The term \"basic white girl feminist\" is a stereotype and dismissive, which could be part of the problem. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong for making a personal choice, especially if she's not causing actual problems. The boyfriend's attitude is more likely the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
