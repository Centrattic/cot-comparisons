He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding and a boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice some women make for various reasons, like cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. The author mentions they don't want to spend money on tampons, which is a valid reason. The boyfriend is upset about possible stains, but the author hasn't actually stained anything except underwear. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems over the top. He's calling her gross and comparing her to a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds dismissive and disrespectful. The fact that the author is crying and in the spare room while he's justified makes me think the emotional dynamics are off. \n\nThe key points are: the author isn't causing actual damage, the boyfriend is being judgmental without a valid reason, and his insults are hurtful. Also, free bleeding is a personal health choice, and unless there's a health or safety issue, it's her body. The boyfriend's concern about potential stains seems trivial compared to respecting her choice. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is more problematic here. The answer should be B.\n"
