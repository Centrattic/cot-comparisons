He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at her boyfriend over free bleeding. \n\nFirst, what's free bleeding? From what I know, it means not using menstrual products and letting blood flow naturally. Some people choose it for various reasons, like environmental concerns, cost, or body acceptance. The author mentions she doesn't want to spend money on tampons, so that's her reason. \n\nThe boyfriend is upset because he's worried about stains and thinks she's being gross. He even called her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds like a dismissive and possibly sexist comment. The author is upset because he's overreacting after she's been doing this for six months without issues. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, she's making a personal health choice. If she's not causing actual problems (like stains beyond her underwear), maybe the boyfriend is being overly concerned. But the boyfriend's reaction is pretty harsh, using insults and making her feel bad. \n\nOn the other hand, he's part of the household, so maybe he has valid concerns about cleanliness? But if she's been doing it without issues, his reaction could be disproportionate. Also, his comment about her being a feminist in a negative way is problematic. \n\nThe author's right to make her own choices about her body is important. Unless there's a direct, unavoidable impact on him that she's ignoring, her choice shouldn't be her fault. The boyfriend's response seems to dismiss her autonomy and mock her, which is more on him. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is more at fault here.\n"
