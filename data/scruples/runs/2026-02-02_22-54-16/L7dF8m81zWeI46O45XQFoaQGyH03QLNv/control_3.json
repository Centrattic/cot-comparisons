He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about free bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use period products like tampons or pads, instead letting the blood flow naturally. The author mentioned this casually while talking with her boyfriend and roommate. Now, her boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and not an adult because she doesn't spend money on tampons. The author is crying and feels he's being justified in his reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's at stake here. Free bleeding is a personal choice and a topic that can be sensitive. Some people choose it for reasons like body autonomy, environmental concerns, or cost. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his discomfort with the idea, possibly due to stigma or personal hygiene beliefs. But is the author wrong for free bleeding? Or is the boyfriend overreacting?\n\nThe key points: The author has been free bleeding for 6+ months without staining anything except her underwear. The boyfriend is worried about staining but hasn't had an actual incident. He's calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and \"disgusting,\" which are judgmental and possibly offensive terms. The author is upset and feels insulted.\n\nPersonal responsibility and mutual respect come into play. The author's choice is her body, and unless it's causing actual harm to others (like staining common areas), it's her right. The boyfriend's issue seems more about his own discomfort rather than real harm. But since they live together, there might be shared spaces, so maybe the author should take precautions. However, if she's only soiling her own underwear and not shared items, it's probably her space. The boyfriend's reaction might be sexist or based on outdated norms. He's not respecting her autonomy and is making her feel bad for her choice. The roommate isn't mentioned as being upset, so maybe he's the only one. The author's anger is a response to being insulted. So, is she wrong for being mad? Probably not. The boyfriend is being judgmental without valid reason. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
