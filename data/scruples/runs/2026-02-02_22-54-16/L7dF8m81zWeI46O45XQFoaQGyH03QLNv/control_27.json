He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and not an adult for not buying tampons. The author is upset and crying in the spare room.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets blood flow freely, often for reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or personal choice. It's a controversial topic; some view it as a feminist stance, others see it as unsanitary.\n\nThe boyfriend is concerned about potential stains and is upset. The author hasn't had any incidents except on her underwear. The boyfriend is escalating the situation, using derogatory language like \"basic white girl feminist\" and \"disgusting.\" The author is defensive, and they're now in a conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, free bleeding is a personal choice. Unless there's a shared living agreement that prohibits it, she's within her rights to choose. The boyfriend's reaction seems over the top, especially since there haven't been issues beyond her underwear. His insults and name-calling are problematic. The fact that she's crying in another room suggests the argument is affecting her emotionally.\n\nThe roommate is mentioned, but the main issue is between the author and her boyfriend. The boyfriend's justification for being angry seems based on his own discomfort rather than any actual harm. The author's choice isn't affecting others beyond her own hygiene, and since she hasn't caused messes, his anger is unwarranted.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is not justified, and he's being dismissive and insulting. The author's right to make her own health choices isn't something to be criticized in this context.\n"
