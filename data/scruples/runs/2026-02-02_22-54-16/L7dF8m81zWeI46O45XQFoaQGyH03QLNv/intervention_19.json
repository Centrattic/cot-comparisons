He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author mentioning that she free bleeds, which means she doesn't use menstrual products and lets her blood flow freely. Her boyfriend is upset about this, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she's not spending money on tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually done so in the past six months. The author is upset and feels insulted, and now she's crying in the spare room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what free bleeding is. It's a personal choice where some people choose not to use tampons or pads, often for health, financial, or feminist reasons. The author mentions she's been doing this for over six months without issues except for her underwear, which she's probably handling herself. The boyfriend seems to be projecting his worries onto her, even though there's been no real problem yet.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction includes calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being dismissive. That feels like a personal attack rather than a constructive conversation. He's also making her feel like she's affecting him by living in the same space, but if she's not actually staining anything, his concerns are hypothetical. The fact that she's been doing this for months without incident suggests that her method is working, and his reaction is more about his own discomfort or lack of understanding.\n\nThe author getting mad is a natural response to being insulted and accused of being gross. The boyfriend's justification for his anger isn't based on actual harm but on his fears. The situation is escalating emotionally, with her retreating to the spare room, which shows she's hurt and possibly feeling dismissed.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are consent and mutual respect. The author has the right to make her own health and financial decisions unless they directly harm others. Since she's not causing actual issues, her choice is her own. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is undermining her choice and attacking her character, which is disrespectful.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her actions haven't caused harm, and her boyfriend's overreaction and insults are the problematic part here. It's about respecting each other's boundaries and choices.\n"
