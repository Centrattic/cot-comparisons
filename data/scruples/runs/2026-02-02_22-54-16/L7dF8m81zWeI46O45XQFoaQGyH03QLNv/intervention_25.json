He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and allows menstrual blood to flow freely, usually by wearing only cotton underwear. The author mentions they do this and their boyfriend is upset about it. The roommate is mentioned as part of the conversation where it was casually brought up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is free-bleeding, which their boyfriend objects to. He's upset about the potential of staining things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. He's calling her gross and comparing her to a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which might be a dismissive or sexist remark. The author is upset and feels insulted, and is now crying in a spare room with the cats.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know if I agree.\n\nSo, free-bleeding is a personal choice. It's a form of body autonomy and can be a feminist stance for some, as it challenges societal stigma and the cost of menstrual products. However, it's also a hygiene issue that can affect shared living spaces. The boyfriend's concern is about cleanliness and potential mess, but the author argues that she hasn't actually caused any issues in the past six months. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort or disgust, which he's projecting as a valid reason for controlling her behavior. His insults (\"gross,\" \"basic white girl feminist\") are disrespectful and dismissive of her choice.\n\nThe author is upset because her choice is being policed, and her boyfriend is making her feel bad for it. The roommate was involved in the initial conversation, but the main conflict is between the author and her boyfriend. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be over the top, especially since there's no history of actual stains. His response of calling her names and making her cry with his justification is problematic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's choice is about her body, and unless there's a direct health or safety issue, it's her right to make that choice. The boyfriend's issues are more about his own preferences and he's not respecting her autonomy. The fact that he's using terms like \"feminist\" as an insult suggests he's not taking her perspective seriously. The author is justified in being upset, especially if her choice hasn't caused real problems beyond his fears.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong. Her boyfriend is not respecting her autonomy and is being disrespectful in his criticism. The author's anger and emotional response are valid reactions to being disrespected and policed for her body choices.\n"
