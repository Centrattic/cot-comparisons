He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author free-bleeding, which is a choice to not use menstrual products and instead bleed into their underwear. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult. The author is upset because he's overreacting, even though she hasn't stained anything except her underwear.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free-bleeding entails. From what I know, it's a personal choice for some women who choose not to use tampons or pads, often for reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. However, living in a shared space can cause issues if others are uncomfortable with it. The boyfriend's concern is about potential mess and his feelings about it. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author is in her own home, and her choice might affect others if she's not cleaning up after herself. But she hasn't actually caused a mess beyond her underwear. The boyfriend is making assumptions and getting upset over something that hasn't happened. He's also using derogatory language, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is dismissive and judgmental.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from discomfort with her choice rather than any actual damage. His comment about being \"gross\" is subjective and doesn't consider her reasons. The author's anger is a valid response if he's belittling her personal decisions without cause. The fact that she's had this practice for six months without issues suggests it's manageable. However, the emotional impact on both sides is significant. The boyfriend feels justified, but his approach is confrontational and disrespectful.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the author's actions were wrong. Here, the author isn't doing anything illegal or harmful; it's a personal choice. The boyfriend is in the wrong for his harsh reaction and judgment. The author's anger is a reasonable response to being insulted and dismissed. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
