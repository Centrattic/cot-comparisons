He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a person who free bleeds and their boyfriend is upset about it, calling her gross and a basic white feminist. They're arguing, and the author is upset and in the spare room crying.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, free bleeding is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets their blood flow naturally, often for environmental or personal reasons. It's a personal choice, and while it can be inconvenient, it's a valid option for some people, especially if they can manage it without causing issues for others.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset because he's worried about stains and thinks the author is being gross. But she's been doing it for six months without staining anything except her underwear. That suggests she's being careful. The boyfriend is bringing in that it's affecting him because he lives there, so maybe he's worried about potential accidents or the smell or something. However, he's also making personal attacks, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which seems dismissive and rude. That's a red flag because it's not addressing her actual actions but attacking her identity.\n\nThe author is upset because her boyfriend is invalidating her choice, which she sees as a personal and feminist decision. She's also being criticized for not spending money on tampons, which could be a financial consideration for her. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his discomfort or fear of potential messes rather than actual problems. Meanwhile, the author is in the wrong if she's being inconsiderate, but since she's been careful and hasn't caused issues, maybe not. The boyfriend's reaction seems overblown and judgmental, especially with the personal insults. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the boyfriend is making personal attacks and not addressing the actual situation. The author is making a personal choice that doesn't seem to be affecting him negatively beyond his fears. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend is overreacting and being disrespectful.\n"
