He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about free bleeding. The author mentions doing this casually while talking with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, calls her gross, and says she's not acting like an adult by not using tampons. The author is upset and crying, feeling he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider free bleeding. It's a personal choice some people make for various reasons\u2014body autonomy, environmental concerns, cost, etc. The author has done it for six months without issues except her underwear. The boyfriend's issue seems to be about potential mess and his reaction to her choice. He's calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" which sounds like a derogatory stereotype, maybe implying her choice is performative or without valid reason. That's a red flag. Using such a term is dismissive and disrespectful.\n\nThe roommate is mentioned but not the main conflict. The key issue is the boyfriend's reaction. The author isn't causing actual harm beyond what she's already handling (just her underwear). The boyfriend's anger seems more about control or his discomfort rather than a legitimate problem. The fact that he's making her feel bad about her choice and calling her names contributes to a toxic dynamic. The author being upset is understandable. So, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic here. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting her choice and being upset by his insults. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
