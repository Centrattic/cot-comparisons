      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author is talking about free bleeding, which means she doesn't use tampons or pads and lets her menstrual blood flow out naturally. She mentioned this casually to her boyfriend and roommate. Now, her boyfriend is upset and thinks she's being gross and not an adult because she's not buying tampons. He's worried she might stain things, even though she hasn't in the past six months. She's mad at him for getting so worked up, and he calls her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and says she's disgusting. She's crying in the spare room with her cats while he feels justified.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice. Some people choose it for various reasons\u2014economic, environmental, body autonomy, etc. The author mentions she doesn't want to spend money on tampons, which could be a financial reason. Choosing to free bleed is not inherently wrong, but it might affect others if, for example, blood gets onto shared items. However, the user says she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, which suggests she's managing it in a way that doesn't impact others. \n\nHer boyfriend is upset about the possibility of staining things, even though it hasn't happened. That could be an overreaction if she's been careful. But he does live there, so his concerns about cleanliness and potential messes are valid. However, his response seems harsh\u2014calling her names and making her cry. The way he's handling the situation, using derogatory terms and making her feel bad, seems problematic.\n\nThe key points are: her choice to free bleed, his overreaction based on hypotheticals rather than actual incidents, his judgmental language, and her being defensive. The question is about whether she's in the wrong. If the boyfriend is being disrespectful and not considering her reasons, then he might be the one in the wrong. But if her choice is affecting him in a way that's not addressed, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong either. But since the problem is more about his reaction than the act itself, especially since it hasn't caused actual issues, the author might not be in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior seems to be the issue here, not her choice.\n"
