He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author free-bleeding, which is a choice some people make for various reasons, and their boyfriend is upset about it. The roommate is also involved in the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free bleeding. From what I know, free bleeding means not using menstrual products like tampons or pads and allowing the blood to flow naturally. It's a personal choice and can be for reasons like comfort, cost, environmental concerns, or personal health. The author mentions not wanting to spend money on tampons, which is a valid reason. However, the boyfriend is upset because he's worried about staining things. The author hasn't stained anything except underwear, but the boyfriend is still upset. The author feels insulted and called out as \"gross\" and a \"basic white girl feminist.\" The boyfriend is making the author feel bad about their choice, which is a personal one.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be judgmental and dismissive of the author's choice. The author is upset and has been crying, which indicates that the boyfriend's response is hurtful. The roommate's involvement in the conversation might have escalated the situation, but the main conflict is between the author and the boyfriend.\n\nIn terms of personal autonomy, people should be able to make choices about their own bodies, even if others disagree. The boyfriend's criticism is about something that's a personal health choice, and his reaction seems more about his own discomfort rather than any real harm caused. The author hasn't caused any actual issues beyond the normal expectation of not staining other items, which they've managed so far. The boyfriend's reaction seems over the top and disrespectful. The author getting mad at being insulted is a reasonable response. So, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
