He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding and the boyfriend being upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding means. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets their blood flow naturally. It's a personal choice, often related to body autonomy or opposing the stigma around menstruation. So the author is free bleeding and the boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and saying she's not acting like an adult because she's saving money by not buying tampons.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's reaction. He's worried about staining things, even though it hasn't happened in 6 months. But he's still worked up, threatening to be angry if it happens. He's also making a judgment based on her choice, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and saying she's disgusting. That sounds like a pretty harsh and personal attack.\n\nThe author is upset because her boyfriend is overreacting and not respecting her choice. She's even crying in the spare room. The question is whether she's the asshole for being mad at him.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The boyfriend is criticizing her personal choice, which is a part of her body autonomy. His comments seem to be based on his own discomfort or societal norms, but that doesn't make her wrong for choosing to free bleed. Also, his reaction is causing conflict in their relationship, and he's dismissing her feelings as feminist nonsense. That's not a healthy response.\n\nOn the other hand, living in a shared space does mean that actions can affect others. If free bleeding were causing actual problems, like stains, then maybe there's a valid concern. But in this case, the author mentions she hasn't stained anything except her underwear. So the boyfriend's fear is not based on actual incidents but his own anxiety or discomfort.\n\nIn terms of being wrong, if the boyfriend is being judgmental and not respecting her choice, that's his issue. The author isn't doing anything that's objectively wrong; she's making a personal health choice. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own biases and not about her actual actions. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for being upset with his treatment of her.\n"
