He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author mentioning that she free bleeds, which is a personal choice where she doesn't use menstrual products and lets her blood flow freely. Her boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she's not buying tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't stained anything except her underwear for six months. She's upset and crying, while he feels justified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free bleeding. It's a practice some people choose for various reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. It's a valid choice, though it can be uncomfortable or seen as taboo by others. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for her choice and her reaction to her boyfriend's criticism.\n\nThe boyfriend's main arguments are that she's gross and affecting him by bleeding on things. However, the author hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. There's no mention of her bleeding on shared items or causing a mess. The boyfriend's concern seems based on fear rather than actual occurrences. His reaction might stem from discomfort or misunderstanding, not actual harm.\n\nNext, the author's reaction: she's upset because he's criticizing her and calling her names like a \"basic white girl feminist.\" She's crying and feeling isolated. Her anger is a response to being judged for a personal choice that hasn't caused real issues. The boyfriend's accusations might be invalidating her autonomy.\n\nIs she in the wrong? The act of free bleeding is a personal choice. Unless she's actually causing harm (which she isn't in this case), her boyfriend's disapproval doesn't make her wrong. He's projecting his discomfort onto her. The fact that she's been doing this for six months without causing stains shows responsibility. The boyfriend's overreaction and name-calling are problematic. He's not respecting her choice, and his comments about her being gross are disrespectful.\n\nThe roommate situation is also a factor. They're sharing a living space, but the author hasn't caused any mess, so the boyfriend's fear might be unfounded. The author's anger at being judged is reasonable. The boyfriend's justification for his actions isn't valid here because there's no actual harm.\n\nIn terms of emotional response, the author is defensive because her autonomy is being attacked. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries or her reasons for free bleeding. The fact that he's calling her a feminist might be a way to dismiss her choice, which is a common tactic in such debates.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong. Her boyfriend is overreacting and disrespecting her personal choice without valid reason. The answer should be B.\n"
