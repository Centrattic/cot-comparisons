He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe author is talking about free bleeding, which is a choice some people make for periods instead of using products like tampons. She mentioned it casually during a conversation with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and saying she's not an adult because she doesn't buy tampons. He's worried about potential stains, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. The author is upset and crying, feeling that her boyfriend is overreacting and using a dismissive term about feminism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if free bleeding is a valid personal choice. It's a topic that can be controversial because some people view it as a feminist stance against the stigma around menstruation, while others might see it as unhygienic. However, the choice should be respected if it's the person's preference and they're managing it responsibly. The key here is that the author hasn't caused any mess, so the boyfriend's concern seems unfounded.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is part of the issue. He's using the term \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is a stereotype and could be considered dismissive or even an insult. That alone is problematic. Also, he's making the author feel guilty for her choice, even though she's not causing any actual problems. His reaction is more about his discomfort or maybe his own biases rather than any real issue.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because she's being judged for a personal health choice that doesn't harm others. The boyfriend is projecting his own feelings onto her, making it about him instead of her autonomy. The fact that he's upset about potential stains but she hasn't made any mess suggests his reaction is exaggerated.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is managing her hygiene in a way that works for her. Unless she's neglecting her responsibilities or causing actual problems, her choice is her own. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own mindset than any real wrongdoing by the author.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend seems to be the one in the wrong for overreacting and invalidating her choice. The author isn't doing anything that harms others, and his judgment is unreasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
