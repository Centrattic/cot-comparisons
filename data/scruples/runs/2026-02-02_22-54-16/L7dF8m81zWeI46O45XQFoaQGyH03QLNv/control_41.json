He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, which the boyfriend is upset about. The author mentions they've been doing this for six months without causing any stains except on their underwear. The boyfriend is concerned about potential messes and the author is upset that he's criticizing her for it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free bleeding. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets the blood flow naturally. It's a personal choice, often related to body autonomy or financial reasons. The author mentions not wanting to spend money on tampons, which could be a valid reason, especially if it's a financial struggle.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is that she's being gross and not acting like an adult. He's worried about staining things. However, the author hasn't actually caused any stains beyond her underwear, so his fears might be exaggerated. His accusation that she's a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being disgusting is pretty harsh and could come off as dismissive of her choice. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect in their living arrangement. The author is free to make her own health choices, and unless there's a direct impact on the boyfriend (like actual stains), his reaction seems overblown. The roommate aspect adds complexity, but if they're all aware and the author is taking precautions not to mess up shared spaces, then the boyfriend's reaction might be unwarranted.\n\nThe author getting mad at his criticism isn't unreasonable. Everyone has different boundaries and preferences, but free bleeding is a personal choice. The boyfriend's justification for being angry if something happens in the future doesn't hold much weight since it hasn't actually happened. His emotional response and dismissive comments could be seen as the problem here. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about his judgment and accusations. The boyfriend's behavior seems more about his discomfort or lack of understanding rather than a valid concern. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
