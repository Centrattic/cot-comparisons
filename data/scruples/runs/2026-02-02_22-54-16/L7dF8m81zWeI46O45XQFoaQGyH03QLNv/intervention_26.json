He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation involving free bleeding and their boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author mentions free bleeding, which is a choice some people make for various reasons, including cost or personal preference. The boyfriend is upset about it, calling her gross and implying she's not acting like an adult. The author is upset because he's overreacting, especially since she hasn't actually caused any stains beyond her underwear. She's also feeling targeted with the \"basic white girl feminist\" comment, which seems hurtful and dismissive. \n\nNow, considering personal choices and autonomy. Free bleeding is a personal health decision. Unless there's a shared living agreement that specifies such things, it's generally up to the individual. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his discomfort rather than any real harm caused. The fact that she hasn't stained anything else in six months suggests that her habits aren't affecting shared spaces. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument about money might be a point, but if she's choosing not to spend money for valid reasons (like cost), that's her choice. It's not her responsibility to justify her personal health decisions to him unless there's a direct impact on him. However, if there were shared responsibilities or agreements, that might change things. But the author hasn't mentioned any such agreements.\n\nThe emotional response from the boyfriend, calling her names and making personal attacks (\"basic white girl feminist\"), seems disrespectful and invalidating. This kind of language can be harmful and is a sign of poor communication. The author's reaction to his behavior is justified if he's making her feel disrespected or attacked.\n\nLiving together can create challenges when personal habits affect shared spaces. However, free bleeding in private areas (like underwear) doesn't inherently impact others unless there's a spillage into common areas. The boyfriend's fear of staining might be exaggerated if there's no evidence of it happening. His reaction being over the top could lead to conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend might need to find a way to communicate his concerns without attacking her choices. If he's genuinely concerned about potential messes, suggesting practical solutions (like having a discreet disposal plan) could be better than judgment. The author's frustration at being blamed and called gross makes sense if he's not respecting her autonomy.\n\nSo, putting this together: The author isn't wrong for making a personal health choice and being upset at his disrespectful reaction. The boyfriend's overreaction and personal attacks are problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
