He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where she free bleeds and her boyfriend is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, free bleeding is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads, allowing their blood to flow naturally. It's often related to environmental or financial concerns, and some people do it as a form of reclaiming their body or rejecting societal taboos around menstruation. So the author's choice here is a personal one, possibly related to feminism or cost-saving.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is reacting negatively, calling her gross and a \"basic white girl feminist,\" and expressing concern about staining. The author is upset because she feels his reaction is over the top, even though she hasn't actually caused any stains beyond her underwear. She's in a spare room now, crying, while he feels justified.\n\nI should consider if free bleeding is a matter of personal choice and autonomy. If the author is not causing any actual problems (no stains on common areas, just her underwear), then maybe the boyfriend's reaction is based on a misunderstanding or his own discomfort with menstruation. His comments about her being gross and his threat to be angry if there's a stain might be disrespectful towards her choice. \n\nHowever, the roommate aspect is important. If they share a living space, there might be concerns about others' comfort. But the user mentions that this has been going on for six months and the only stains are on her underwear. So maybe the risk is minimal. The boyfriend's reaction could be seen as projecting his own discomfort onto her, rather than respecting her decision unless it's affecting others. \n\nThe term \"basic white girl feminist\" is a bit of a stereotype, implying she's not a \"real\" feminist. That's a judgmental and possibly derogatory term, which might indicate that the boyfriend is not respecting her perspective. The author's choice to free bleed, while personal, should be within her rights as long as it doesn't harm others. The boyfriend's overreaction and insults might be the problem here, not the act of free bleeding itself. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not the one in the wrong if her choice is a personal one without causing actual harm or mess in shared spaces. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues and disrespect for her autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
