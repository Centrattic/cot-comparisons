He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a disagreement between the author and her boyfriend about her choice to free bleed. The key points here are the context of their conversation, the boyfriend's reaction, and the author's feelings about it.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice some women make for various reasons, including health, cost, or environmental concerns. The author mentions she's been doing this for six months without causing any mess beyond her underwear. So, from her perspective, it's a manageable and personal choice. However, the boyfriend is upset, not because there's actual damage, but because he fears potential messes. He's also criticizing her for being \"gross\" and calling her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which seems like a dismissive and possibly disrespectful remark. \n\nThe boyfriend's main issue seems to be about potential future problems rather than any real current issues. The author isn't causing him harm right now, but he's projecting anxiety about possible future stains. That might be a valid concern if the author isn't taking precautions, but based on the information, she hasn't had any issues in six months. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction includes name-calling and invalidating her reasons for free bleeding. He's making personal attacks (\"you're being disgusting\") and linking her choice to a stereotype, which is not constructive. The author is upset because her choice is being criticized and she feels her autonomy is being dismissed. \n\nIn relationships, autonomy and mutual respect are key. The boyfriend is overreacting based on hypotheticals and not addressing the actual situation. The author isn't in the wrong for making a choice that affects her and taking reasonable steps (since she hasn't had accidents). The boyfriend's approach is more about his own discomfort and not respecting her decision, which is a problem. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here; he's not respecting her choice and is projecting his fears onto her without cause.\n"
