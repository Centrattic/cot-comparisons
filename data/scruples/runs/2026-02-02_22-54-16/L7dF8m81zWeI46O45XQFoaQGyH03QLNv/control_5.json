He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a disagreement between the author and their boyfriend about free bleeding. The author mentions that they've been free bleeding for six months without staining anything except their underwear, but the boyfriend is upset, calling the practice gross and implying it's a feminist stance that's inconsiderate. The author is upset and crying, feeling insulted by the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Free bleeding is a personal health choice that some women make for various reasons, including cost or personal preference. The author states they haven't caused any mess beyond their underwear, which is a common part of menstruation. The boyfriend's main issue seems to be the potential for staining, even though there hasn't been an actual problem in six months. His reaction includes calling the author gross and making judgmental comments about their feminist views. The author feels insulted and is upset about being called an \"asshole\" for being mad at his reaction.\n\nNow, evaluating both sides. The author's choice to free bleed is their personal decision, and as long as it's not causing harm or mess beyond their own belongings, it's a valid choice. The boyfriend's concern about staining is understandable, but if there's no evidence of actual stains beyond the expected, his worry might be unfounded. His judgmental comments about the author's motivations (calling it basic white girl feminism) and his dismissal of her feelings when she's upset seem problematic. The author is justified in feeling upset if they are being criticized for a personal health choice that doesn't negatively impact others.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction crosses into being disrespectful by attacking the author's character and motivations. The author is not wrong for being upset about being insulted. The situation seems more like a misunderstanding or clash of values rather than the author being in the wrong. The boyfriend's response, including making the author feel bad about their choice and causing emotional distress, indicates that he might be the one in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
