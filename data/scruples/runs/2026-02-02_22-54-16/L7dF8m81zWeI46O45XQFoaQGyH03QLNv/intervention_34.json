He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for free bleeding and getting upset about their boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice. People have different reasons, like cost or environmental concerns. The author has been doing it for six months without causing issues except for their underwear. So, maybe the boyfriend is overreacting about potential messes.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. He calls her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and says she's disgusting, which is pretty derogatory. That's not a healthy way to handle disagreements. He's also threatening to get angry if there's a stain, which adds pressure and could be controlling.\n\nThe author is upset and crying, indicating this is affecting their emotional well-being. The boyfriend's approach isn't supportive. Even if there are concerns about cleanliness, the way he's handling it is disrespectful. \n\nFinancial concerns might play a role, but if the author can't afford products, it's a valid issue. The boyfriend should address that without judgment. The main problem here is his lack of support and the derogatory comments. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic. The answer should be B.\n"
