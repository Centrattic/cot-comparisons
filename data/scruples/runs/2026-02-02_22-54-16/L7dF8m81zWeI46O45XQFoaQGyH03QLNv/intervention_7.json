I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate, and the boyfriend is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, free bleeding is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads, allowing their blood to flow naturally. It's a personal choice often rooted in autonomy, cost, or environmental reasons. So the author mentions that she's been doing this for six months and hasn't stained anything except her underwear. The boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and an adult who shouldn't be spending money on tampons. He's worried about potential stains affecting him, even though she hasn't had any issues so far. He also accuses her of being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and is causing her emotional distress.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors. The main points are: the choice to free bleed, the boyfriend's reaction, and the conflict that followed.\n\nThe author's choice to free bleed is a personal health decision. It's her body, and she has the right to make decisions about her own body, as long as it doesn't harm others. The boyfriend is concerned about possible stains, but she hasn't caused any yet. His reaction seems to be based on his discomfort or fear, not actual harm. He's also making judgmental comments about her being \"gross,\" which is disrespectful. Plus, he's accused her of being a feminist, which is a bit of a stereotype and dismissive. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014calling her names, making her cry, and feeling justified\u2014seem more problematic. The author is upset because her partner is invalidating her choice and attacking her character. The roommate is involved, but the main conflict is between the author and her boyfriend.\n\nI should consider if there's any harm caused. The author hasn't stained anything, so there's no actual mess or cost involved. The boyfriend's anxiety about potential stains is his issue, not hers. He could address it by setting boundaries or communicating better, but instead, he's being critical and aggressive. The author being upset in response is reasonable, as he's not respecting her autonomy and is emotionally abusive.\n\nThe boyfriend's use of the term \"basic white girl feminist\" is a stereotype that undermines her legitimate choice and could be a form of gaslighting or belittlement. This kind of rhetoric is often used to dismiss women's health decisions, which is a red flag.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not in the wrong for making a personal choice and being upset by her partner's disrespectful behavior. The boyfriend has the responsibility to manage his own feelings and communicate them without attacking her. He could have a conversation about his concerns without making her feel guilty or gross.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are her own choice, and her boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
