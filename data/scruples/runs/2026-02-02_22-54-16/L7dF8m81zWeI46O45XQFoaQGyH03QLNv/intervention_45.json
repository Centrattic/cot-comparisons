He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves discussing free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. The author mentions that she free bleeds, which is a choice some people make for various reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. Her boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she doesn't buy tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything beyond her underwear. He's even called her a basic white girl feminist and is making her feel bad, leading her to cry in the spare room with her cats.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice. It's about bodily autonomy, which is a valid topic. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his discomfort or judgment rather than any real harm caused. The author hasn't stained anything, so his fear is hypothetical. He's also bringing in financial arguments, but if she can't afford tampons, that's a real issue. His labeling her as a \"basic white girl feminist\" is dismissive and possibly a form of gaslighting or invalidating her choice based on stereotypes.\n\nThe roommate is mentioned, but the main conflict is between the author and her boyfriend. The boyfriend's attitude is creating a hostile environment. The author's emotional response (crying, needing to retreat) indicates that his behavior is toxic. The boyfriend's use of derogatory terms and his insistence that she's wrong despite no actual issues suggest he's being the asshole here. The author is standing up for her rights and choices, which is a reasonable reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
