He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about free bleeding, which is a choice some people make to not use menstrual products like tampons or pads. The author mentions they've been doing this for six months without any issues except their underwear. The boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and implying she's acting like a child for not buying tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually done so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice related to body autonomy. The author isn't harming anyone else; she's just not using products. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his own discomfort or preferences, but is that a valid reason to criticize her? Also, the fact that he's calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being judgmental might indicate his own issues with her choices rather than any actual harm caused.\n\nThe key points are: she's not causing any real problems (no stains beyond her underwear), he's the one who's upset, and he's dismissing her reasons. The author's anger at being criticized is understandable if she's not actually affecting others. The boyfriend might be projecting his own discomfort or not respecting her autonomy. So, it seems like the boyfriend is wrong here for being judgmental without a valid reason. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her choice, especially when it's not impacting others. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
