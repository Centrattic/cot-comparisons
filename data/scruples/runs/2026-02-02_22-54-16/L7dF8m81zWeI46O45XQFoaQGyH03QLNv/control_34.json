      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about free bleeding. The user is a woman who mentioned she free bleeds, which means she doesn't use menstrual products and lets her blood flow naturally. She's doing this to save money, and her boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult. He's worried she'll stain things, even though she hasn't in the past six months. She got mad and is now upset, thinking he's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider free bleeding itself. Free bleeding is a personal choice that some women make for various reasons, including cost, convenience, or personal preference. It's not illegal or harmful, and some argue it's a natural process. However, it's also important to consider living situations. If someone is free bleeding and it's affecting others, like staining shared spaces, that could be a point of contention. But in this case, the author mentions she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, so the impact seems minimal.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is key here. He's calling her gross and linking it to being a \"basic white girl feminist.\" That's a problematic statement, as it's a stereotype and dismisses her valid reasons for free bleeding. His concern about staining might be genuine, but his delivery is harsh and disrespectful. He's also making her feel like she's wrong for being upset, which isn't helpful. His comments about her being gross and his justification for being angry could be contributing to the conflict.\n\nThe author's response is understandable. She's defending her choice, which is her right. If the boyfriend is making her feel bad for a choice that's not harming others, that's a problem. The fact that she's crying and in the spare room shows emotional distress caused by his reaction. His dismissal of her feelings as being \"basic white girl feminist\" is a form of gaslighting or belittling her, which is not acceptable.\n\nLooking at the roommates, the mention of talking about periods with the boyfriend and roommate might mean there's a shared living space. If free bleeding isn't affecting others beyond the immediate personal area, then the boyfriend's concern might be overblown. However, if there's a shared bathroom or common areas, there could be hygiene considerations. But since the author hasn't stained anything except her own underwear, the boyfriend's worries might not be based on actual incidents, making his reaction seem excessive.\n\nThe core issue is consent and mutual respect in the living situation. The author has a right to make her own health choices, and the boyfriend has a right to express his concerns. However, the way he's handling it\u2014calling her gross, using derogatory terms, and invalidating her feelings\u2014is where the problem lies. The author's anger is a response to being criticized for a personal choice that's not causing harm, so she's not in the wrong for being upset.\n\nIn conclusion, the boyfriend's behavior is more problematic here. The author isn't in the wrong for free bleeding if it's not causing issues, and her reaction to his harsh criticism is justified. The key factors are the lack of actual harm and the disrespectful manner in which her partner is handling the situation.\n"
