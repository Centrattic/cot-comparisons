He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is a choice some people make for various reasons like cost, convenience, or personal preference. The author mentions they've been doing this for six months without staining anything except their underwear, but their boyfriend is upset about it. He's called them gross and said they're acting like a child for not buying tampons. The author is upset because of this and is crying, feeling like their partner is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice, and while some might find it unhygienic, others see it as a valid lifestyle choice. The author hasn't caused actual problems beyond the boyfriend's discomfort. The key points here are consent, living arrangements, and mutual respect. The boyfriend is living in the same house, so maybe his concerns about cleanliness or potential messes are valid. However, if the author hasn't actually made a mess beyond their underwear, then the boyfriend's reaction might be overblown. The author's right to make their own medical and personal choices is important. The boyfriend's accusation that she's being \"disgusting\" seems judgmental. Also, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" is a dismissive and possibly inflammatory comment, which isn't helpful.\n\nThe author is upset because their partner is criticizing their personal choice, which is a valid reaction. If the boyfriend is making her feel bad about her choices without a legitimate reason, that's a problem. The fact that she's been doing this for six months without issues suggests that her method is working for her. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from his own discomfort or lack of understanding, but that doesn't make him right to criticize her. They both need to communicate better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's not causing actual harm and is making a personal choice, she's likely not in the wrong. The boyfriend's overreaction and derogatory comments indicate he's the one being unreasonable here. So the answer should be B.\n"
