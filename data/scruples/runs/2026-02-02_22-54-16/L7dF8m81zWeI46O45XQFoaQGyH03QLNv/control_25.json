      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about free bleeding, which I think means she's not using tampons or pads and letting her period flow naturally, probably using just a cloth or nothing. She mentioned it casually to her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, thinking she's gross and not an adult because she doesn't buy tampons. She's been doing this for six months without staining anything except her underwear, but he's still upset about the possibility. She's now crying in the spare room while he feels justified.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice and a feminist issue for some. It's about bodily autonomy and rejecting the idea that menstruation is dirty. So, if she's chosen this method and it's working without causing actual problems (no stains except her underwear), maybe her choice is valid. However, the boyfriend might be concerned about potential messes or hygiene, even if it hasn't happened yet. But he's taking it too far by criticizing her and making her feel bad. He's also using derogatory terms like calling her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is dismissive and hurtful. \n\nShe's getting mad at him for being upset when she's not actually causing problems. But is she wrong? If her choice is a personal one and she's not harming him, maybe he's the one overreacting. On the other hand, maybe he's justified in caring about the living environment. However, he's making her feel guilty and attacking her for a personal choice. The fact that he's so worked up about a hypothetical scenario (staining things) that hasn't happened might make him the asshole. She's in her right to be upset if he's being insulting. So, probably the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. The key points are about personal choice vs. his concerns. If she's not actually making a mess, then his reaction is unwarranted. Also, calling her names and dismissing her stance is definitely on him. So, B makes sense.\n"
