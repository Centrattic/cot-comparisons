He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about free bleeding, which is a personal choice related to menstruation. The author mentions they do this to save money, and their boyfriend is upset because he's worried about stains. They got into an argument, and now they're feeling hurt and called out as gross or a \"basic white girl feminist.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Free bleeding is a choice some people make for various reasons, including cost. It's a personal decision, and while some might find it unhygienic, others see it as a valid choice. The boyfriend is upset about potential messes, but the author hasn't actually made a mess in six months. That seems like a valid point for the author.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his discomfort with the idea rather than an actual problem. The author is getting mad because they feel judged for their choices. The boyfriend's comment about being a \"basic white girl feminist\" is dismissive and possibly sexist, which is a red flag. Using terms like \"gross\" without cause is another issue. \n\nThe author's emotional response (crying in the spare room) indicates they're hurt, which suggests the boyfriend's words were harsh. The key here is whether the author overstepped by mentioning their free bleeding in front of the roommate. However, it's a private choice, and discussing it in a conversation about periods might be reasonable. \n\nThe boyfriend's main issue seems to be his own discomfort and the potential for mess, but since the author has managed it without incidents, his concern might be unwarranted. The author isn't causing harm, so their anger at being criticized is justified. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because they're making a personal choice that affects them, not causing actual harm, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues rather than a valid concern. The boyfriend's harsh words and judgmental attitude are the main problems here.\n"
