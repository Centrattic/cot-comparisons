He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is about free bleeding. The author mentions doing this casually during a conversation with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and not an adult because she's not buying tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. The author is crying in the spare room, and the boyfriend thinks she's being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and disgusting.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. Free bleeding is a personal choice. Some people choose it for various reasons\u2014cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his discomfort or fear of stains, but the author hasn't caused any issues except in her underwear. The fact that she's been doing it for six months without incident might indicate it's manageable. The boyfriend's justification of being \"justified\" and dismissing her feelings could be the problem here. He's making her feel bad for her choice, which is a personal decision. The author getting upset is a natural response to being criticized for something she's not harming others with. \n\nThe boyfriend's arguments might not hold much weight if there's no actual problem beyond his anxiety. The term \"basic white girl feminist\" is a stereotype that dismisses her reasons without understanding. The key here is whether her actions are affecting him negatively. Since there's no mention of actual messes beyond her own belongings, his complaints seem more about his own discomfort rather than any real harm. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a personal choice that doesn't impact others, and her boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues rather than a valid concern. The answer should be B.\n"
