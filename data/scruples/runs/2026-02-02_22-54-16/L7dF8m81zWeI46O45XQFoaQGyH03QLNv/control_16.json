He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author mentioned free bleeding to their boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and implying she's not an adult for not buying tampons. She's upset and crying, feeling he's being unfair.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice some people make for various reasons like cost, health, or environmental concerns. It's a valid choice even if others don't understand it. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh\u2014labeling her as gross and a basic white feminist might be dismissive and judgmental. He's also worried about staining, but she's said it hasn't happened except on her underwear. His anger might stem from discomfort with the topic or his own biases.\n\nThe author is getting mad because she feels her choice is being policed. She's defending her right to choose. The boyfriend's comments about her being a \"basic white girl feminist\" might be a stereotype, suggesting he's oversimplifying her motives. That's probably not helpful. The roommate's reaction isn't clear, but the main conflict is between the couple.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's exercising her choice, and while she's aware of potential mess, she's managed it so far. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort and judgment rather than actual harm. So, the answer is B.\n"
