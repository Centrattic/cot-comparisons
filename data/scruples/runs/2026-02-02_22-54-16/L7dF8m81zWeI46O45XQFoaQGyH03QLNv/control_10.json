He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is a choice some people make for various reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. The author mentions they've been doing this for six months without staining anything except their underwear. Their boyfriend is upset, calling them gross and suggesting they're not acting like an adult because they don't buy tampons. The author is upset and now in the spare room crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The boyfriend is concerned about possible messes and the impact on their shared living space. He's worried about stains, which is a valid concern in a shared home. On the other hand, the author is defending their choice, which is a personal decision. Free bleeding is a controversial topic; some see it as a feminist stance against the stigma around menstruation, while others might find it unhygienic. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his personal discomfort or concerns about cleanliness. However, the author hasn't caused any actual problems\u2014no stains except on their underwear. The boyfriend is getting worked up about a potential issue that hasn't materialized. The author is getting mad because they feel their choice is being criticized without cause. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are making a personal choice that affects their own hygiene and maybe the household, but they've been careful not to cause issues. The boyfriend's reaction is about his feelings and concerns, but he's also making a judgment about the author's feminism and being gross, which might be dismissive of her reasons. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The author's choice is within their right to make, as long as it doesn't harm others. 2) The boyfriend's concerns are about potential messes, but there's no actual evidence of harm. 3) The author hasn't violated any rules or caused real damage. 4) The boyfriend's insults (\"basic white girl feminist\") are dismissive and not constructive.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing to free bleed, especially since they haven't caused actual problems. The boyfriend's overreaction and judgmental comments are the main issues here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
