He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person sharing the story) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend criticizing her for free bleeding, which is a choice she's made. First, I need to understand what free bleeding entails. From what I know, it's when someone chooses to menstruate without using traditional menstrual products, which can be a personal or political choice related to body autonomy, cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset because he thinks it's gross and that she's acting immature by not spending money on tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't stained anything except her underwear. The author is upset that he's so worked up about it and that he's called her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and \"disgusting.\" She's crying in the spare room with her cats, feeling hurt.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend is expressing his discomfort and making judgments about her personal choice. Free bleeding is a personal decision and doesn't inherently harm others unless it's unhygienic or affects shared spaces. The author hasn't caused any actual mess, just the boyfriend's anxiety about potential stains. His reaction seems to be based on his personal feelings rather than any real harm. \n\nHe's also using derogatory language and making personal attacks, which is not a constructive way to handle disagreements. The author's frustration is valid because his criticism is invasive and dismissive of her autonomy. The fact that he's calling her a feminist in a derogatory way (using \"basic white girl feminist\" as an insult) suggests his own biases and misunderstanding of feminist principles, which are about personal choice and equality.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything that's physically harmful. His emotional reaction is his own issue, but his response is inappropriate. He has a responsibility to respect her choices unless they directly affect him in a negative way. However, if the free bleeding is causing him distress because of the possibility of staining shared items, maybe there's a middle ground. But since the author hasn't actually caused any stains, his reaction seems overblown.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the boyfriend is uncomfortable, he could communicate his concerns without shaming her. The author could possibly consider using a menstrual cup or other options if she's open to it, but it's her body and her choice. The boyfriend's approach is toxic because he's attacking her character and using guilt-tripping tactics. The author's anger is a valid response to his judgmental behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is being judgmental and disrespectful. The answer should be B (No).\n"
