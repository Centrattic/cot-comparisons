He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author mentioning that they free bleed, which is when someone chooses not to use commercial menstrual products like tampons or pads and instead allows menstrual blood to exit the body naturally. The boyfriend is upset about this, saying the author is gross and not acting like an adult because they don't buy tampons. The author is upset with the boyfriend for being judgmental and making them feel this way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. Free bleeding is a personal choice that some people make for various reasons, including cost, environmental concerns, or personal beliefs. The boyfriend's reaction is that the author is being gross and irresponsible. The author feels they're being unfairly judged and that the boyfriend is overreacting, especially since they haven't actually caused any mess beyond their underwear.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The boyfriend's concern is about potential mess in their shared living space. However, the author has been free bleeding for six months without incidents except for their underwear. That suggests that the author is managing it well and hasn't caused any problems. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his personal discomfort or disgust rather than any actual harm caused.\n\nThe boyfriend is also calling the author a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is a derogatory label. That's a clear instance of name-calling and dismissive behavior, which is not constructive. The author is emotional and upset, crying in the spare room, indicating that the boyfriend's words are hurting them. \n\nFrom a standpoint of personal autonomy, the author has the right to make decisions about their own body, as long as it doesn't harm others. Since free bleeding hasn't caused any issues beyond the author's underwear, it's a personal choice. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his own judgment rather than any real problem. It's important to respect others' choices, even if you disagree with them, as long as it's safe and consensual.\n\nHowever, the situation is in a shared living space, so there might be considerations about mutual respect and communication. The boyfriend could express his concerns without belittling the author. The author might also consider if there's a middle ground, like using cloth pads if cost is a concern, but the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they haven't caused actual problems and the boyfriend is being judgmental, the author isn't necessarily at fault. \n\nThe name-calling and the boyfriend's refusal to acknowledge the author's feelings or the lack of actual mess indicate that he's not being supportive. The author's anger is a valid response to being criticized for a personal choice that hasn't affected others negatively. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
