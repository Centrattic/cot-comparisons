He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, which is a personal choice some people make for various reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or discomfort with commercial products. The author mentions doing this for six months without staining anything except her underwear, but her boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and accusing her of being a \"basic white girl feminist.\" She's upset because he criticizes her choice, even though she hasn't caused any mess beyond her own clothing.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal health choice. There's no inherent wrong in someone choosing to do this, especially if it's working for them. The boyfriend's issue seems to be more about his personal discomfort or judgment rather than any actual harm caused. The author isn't making others clean up after her; she's only responsible for her own hygiene. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from a lack of understanding or personal bias rather than a valid concern. The fact that she's been doing this for months without issues supports her stance. His criticism being based on her not acting like an adult because she's saving money might indicate his priorities or values conflicting with hers. Since there's no mention of her behavior affecting him beyond his own perceptions, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset by his judgment. The boyfriend's behavior here is more about his own discomfort and judgment, which isn't a valid reason to criticize her valid health choice. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
