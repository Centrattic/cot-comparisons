He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about free bleeding, which is a choice some people make where they don't use menstrual products and let the blood flow naturally. The author mentioned this casually during a conversation with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she's saving money by not buying tampons. The author hasn't stained anything except her underwear, but the boyfriend is worried about potential messes. She's upset and in another room, crying, while he feels justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice and part of body autonomy. People have different reasons for their choices, like cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. The boyfriend is criticizing her for it, calling her gross and implying her choices affect him negatively. The author is upset because he's overreacting, given that there's been no mess beyond her underwear. \n\nIs she in the wrong for free bleeding? It's a personal decision, and unless she's harming others, it's her body. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his discomfort or judgment rather than actual harm. The fact that she's been doing it for six months without issues suggests her method is managed. His criticism might be invalidating her choice. However, maybe there's a valid concern about potential messes, but his response is harsh and possibly disrespectful.\n\nThe roommate's perspective isn't discussed, but the main conflict is between the couple. The boyfriend using the term \"basic white girl feminist\" could be a dismissive tactic to undermine her. The author's emotional response (crying) indicates he's crossed a line in how he's treating her. \n\nSo, the key points: The author isn't in the wrong for choosing free bleeding. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his judgment and overreaction rather than any real harm. The author's anger is a valid response to being belittled. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
