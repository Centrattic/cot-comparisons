I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author mentions they free bleed, which means they don't use menstrual products like tampons and let their blood flow out naturally. They mentioned this casually while talking with their boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she's not spending money on tampons. He's worried she'll stain things, even though she hasn't yet except for her underwear. The author feels insulted and is upset, leading her to cry in the spare room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what free bleeding entails. It's a choice some people make for various reasons\u2014health, cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. The boyfriend is criticizing her for it, calling her gross and implying she's not an adult. The author is getting angry because he's making her feel bad about her choice, especially since she's been doing it without issues for six months. \n\nIs it her fault for making this personal choice? Probably not. She has the right to make decisions about her body. However, maybe there are considerations about shared living space. If she's free bleeding, there's a possibility of blood getting on shared items, but she hasn't had any incidents except her underwear. The boyfriend is worried about staining, but his reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort than an actual problem. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is problematic because he's calling her choices disgusting and implying she's being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is a derogatory way to dismiss her stance. He's not respecting her choice and is making her feel bad. The author is upset because he's invalidating her reasons and reacting with anger. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the boyfriend is overreacting. The author isn't doing anything harmful, just making a personal choice. Unless there's a specific reason that free bleeding is causing actual problems, his criticism seems unwarranted. The fact that she's had no issues for six months suggests that her method is working. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The boyfriend is dismissing her valid choice and making her feel guilty. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
