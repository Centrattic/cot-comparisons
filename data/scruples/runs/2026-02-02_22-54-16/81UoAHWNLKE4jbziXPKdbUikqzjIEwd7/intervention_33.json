Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. The author is 25, his sister is 30, and they're both gay. The sister wants to have a family and asked him to donate sperm so that both her and her partner can be biologically related to the child. The author says no because he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to just be an uncle. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy or homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Donating sperm for family members can be a big deal. The author's reasons are about his own desire to be a father, which is a personal choice. He's explaining that he wants to be fully involved in a child's life, not just a sperm donor. That makes sense as a personal boundary.\n\nThe sister's perspective is also valid; she wants to create a family with her partner and is looking for a way to have biological ties. She might feel that her brother, being close to her, is the ideal choice. However, the author isn't obligated to fulfill her wishes, especially when it conflicts with his own dreams.\n\nThe sister is upset and feels hurt, which is understandable. But the author isn't being selfish if he's being honest about his feelings. It's important to respect each person's autonomy. The author isn't causing harm by saying no, and his reasons are personal and valid. The sister might need to find another solution, like using a sperm bank, but that's on her to handle.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's aware of the sister's needs but still feels his own needs are more pressing right now. There's no obligation for family members to donate gametes, even if they're close. His desire to have children himself is legitimate. The sister might need to accept that her brother can't help and move forward with other options.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a choice based on his own life goals, and it's not fair to label him as selfish or unreasonable. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
