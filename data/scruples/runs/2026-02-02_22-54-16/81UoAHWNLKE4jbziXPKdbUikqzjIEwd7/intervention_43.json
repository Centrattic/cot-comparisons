Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister wants to have a child and is asking for sperm donation from her brother. The brother is gay, and the sister is a lesbian. The brother is close to his sister and wants the best for her. But he's uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself. He feels that donating sperm would mean his child is raised by someone else, and he wants full involvement in fatherhood. The sister is upset, calling him selfish and unreasonable.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethics and the dynamics here. On one hand, the sister is in a position where she can't have a biological child without a sperm donor. She's asking her brother, which is a big request. The brother is being asked to give up the chance to be a biological father, even though he might not get that opportunity otherwise. But he's not being forced; he's making a personal choice based on his own desires.\n\nThe key points here are consent and personal choice. The brother isn't obligated to donate sperm. He's making a decision based on his own feelings and future plans. It's his body, and he has the right to say no. The sister's frustration is understandable, but she can't force him to do something he's not comfortable with. \n\nHowever, the brother is close to his sister, and his refusal is causing emotional distress. He might feel guilty, and the sister is upset. But is that enough to say he's in the wrong? The post mentions that he's explained his reasons, and the sister is calling him selfish. But being selfish in this context could be a matter of perspective. He's prioritizing his own future as a parent, which is a personal dream. \n\nAlso, the sister could explore other options for sperm donation, like using a sperm bank. Maybe she's hoping for a more personal connection with the donor, but that's her choice, not his. The brother isn't in the wrong for not fulfilling a request that conflicts with his own life goals. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that he should put his sister's needs first because they're family and she's close to him. But family doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your own desires. Everyone has the right to make decisions about their body. The sister might need to accept that her brother has his own priorities.\n\nIn conclusion, the brother isn't in the wrong. He's making a choice based on his personal aspirations and feelings, and while it's causing conflict, he's not obligated to donate sperm. The sister needs to find another solution for her family planning. So the answer should be B.\n"
