Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is gay and close to their sister, who is also gay. The sister wants to have a child with her partner and is asking the author to donate sperm. The author is uncomfortable because they also want to become a parent someday, and they feel that donating sperm would mean their child is raised by someone else, which they're not okay with. \n\nThe sister is upset, calling the author selfish and unreasonable. The author is conflicted because they want to support their sister but can't sacrifice their own dreams of parenthood. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's perspective is that she's being denied a family, and the author is prioritizing their own desires. But on the other hand, the author has valid personal reasons related to their own aspirations and the emotional impact of not being the parent. \n\nIn terms of ethics, everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body and future. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm, even for a family member. They have a legitimate desire to have their own children, which is a personal choice. The sister's hurt feelings are understandable, but the author isn't being selfish in the sense of ignoring their sister's needs; they're balancing two important aspects of their life.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that donating sperm would leave them as an uncle, not a parent, which is a significant emotional concern. The sister might see it as a sacrifice, but the author isn't willing to make that trade-off. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to their own choices and personal goals. It's not about being selfish but about personal priorities and emotional readiness.\n"
