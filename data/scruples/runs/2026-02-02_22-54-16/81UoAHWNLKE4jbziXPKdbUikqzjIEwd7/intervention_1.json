Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is being asked whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The author is 25, their sister is 30, and they both are gay. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, but the author is uncomfortable because they want to be a parent themselves one day. The sister is upset, calling them selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, sperm donation is a medical procedure with legal agreements to define parentage. If the author donates sperm, they might not be legally recognized as the parent, which could affect their rights and the child's relationship with them. However, the author mentioned that the sperm would go into the sister-in-law, not the sister. Depending on the country's laws, this could mean the sister-in-law is the legal parent, and the sister might not be. But the post says IVF is available for lesbian couples, which might mean they plan to have the child through the sister, but maybe using the sister-in-law as a surrogate? Not sure, but the key point is the author wants to be a parent themselves.\n\nNext, the emotional aspect. The author has a strong desire to be a parent and feels that donating sperm would mean they can't fulfill that dream. The sister, on the other hand, is hurt and feels rejected. The author is close to their sister and doesn't want to deny her a family. But is the author obligated to donate? In many cases, individuals have the right to make personal health decisions, including reproductive choices. The author isn't being forced; they can choose to donate or not. The sister is asking, not demanding. The author's reasons are personal and relate to their own life goals.\n\nThe sister is upset, which is understandable, but does that make the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the author had a duty to donate. Since there's no legal or moral obligation, the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own desires. However, the sister might feel that the author isn't being supportive enough. The author might be seen as selfish if they have the means to help a family member but don't want to. But if the author has valid personal reasons, that could mitigate that perception.\n\nAlso, the sister's accusations of internalized homophobia and jealousy might not be valid. The author is gay and has resolved those issues, so the refusal is more about their own dream of parenthood. The sister's reaction could be a misunderstanding of the author's motivations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to make their own reproductive choices. While the sister is hurt, the author isn't obligated to donate. The key is that the author is not causing harm but is making a personal decision that's valid for their own future.\n"
