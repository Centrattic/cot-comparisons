Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 25-year-old gay man, very close to his 30-year-old lesbian sister. She wants to start a family and is asking him to donate sperm so that both she and her wife can be biologically related to the child. The author is uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself, values being fully involved in a child's life, and doesn't want to just be an uncle. He's worried about missing out on the experience of parenthood, considering adoption and surrogacy challenges. He said no, and his sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy or internalized homophobia. The author is conflicted, questioning if he's being unreasonable.\n\nNow, the key points to consider here. The author's reasons for declining are personal and valid. He has a strong desire to be a parent himself, which is a fundamental personal goal. The sister's request is understandable, given her desire to have a biological child with her spouse. However, the author's comfort and future aspirations are important. \n\nEthically, should someone be forced to donate sperm just because a family member wants it? Probably not. The right to bodily autonomy is a big factor here. The author isn't obligated to comply, even if it's a family member. His reasons aren't malicious; they're based on his own life goals. \n\nThe sister's reaction is understandable but perhaps a bit harsh. She's upset because she wanted support, and the author's refusal, while respectful, might feel like a rejection of her needs. However, the author isn't being selfish if his reasons are genuine. He's prioritizing his own future, which is a valid choice. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If we consider that he communicated his decision clearly and respectfully, and his reasons are personal and not harmful, then he's not in the wrong. On the other hand, some might argue that family obligations come first, but that's subjective. \n\nThe sister's accusations of selfishness and jealousy might not be accurate. The author is making a choice based on his own life plans, which isn't inherently selfish. Internalized homophobia doesn't seem to be a factor here, as he's open about his sexuality and his desire to be a parent, which is separate from his sexual orientation. \n\nSurrogacy and adoption complexities add context to his decision. Knowing that options are limited, he's making a choice that's in his own best interest. The fact that he's willing to donate if he already had a child shows he's not rejecting his sister's request out of hand but based on his current life circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because his decision is based on personal, valid reasons. The sister's hurt feelings are real, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice his own goals for hers. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
