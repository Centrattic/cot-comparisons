Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The author is gay, 25, and his sister is 30, a lesbian who wants to have a family. She asked him to donate sperm so both she and her partner can be biologically related to the child. The author turned her down because he wants to be a father himself, not just an uncle, and he's worried about missing out on fatherhood.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's reasons are personal and about his own desires. He's not trying to harm his sister; he's just prioritizing his own future. The sister is upset, feeling rejected and accused the author of being selfish. The question is whether the author is wrong for saying no.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, people have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. Sperm donation is a significant decision, and the author isn't obligated to do it. His feelings about wanting to be a parent himself are valid. It's his choice, even if it's painful for the sister. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's close to his sister and wanted to help, but he's also honest about his limits. The sister's disappointment is understandable, but that doesn't make the author wrong for declining. People can have different values and priorities. The sister might not see it that way, but the author isn't being selfish just because he says no. He's making a personal choice based on his own life goals.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's situation. She's trying to build a family through available legal means (IVF), which is valid. But the author's reasons for declining are about his own fears and aspirations. There's no moral obligation here, especially since it's a personal request, not a medical necessity. The author isn't causing harm; he's just not fulfilling a request that he feels conflicts with his own desires.\n\nThe sister's reaction, calling him selfish, might be more about her hurt and frustration than the actual rightness of his decision. The author isn't denying her the opportunity to have a child entirely\u2014she can use other methods. He's just not providing a specific route she wanted. So the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
