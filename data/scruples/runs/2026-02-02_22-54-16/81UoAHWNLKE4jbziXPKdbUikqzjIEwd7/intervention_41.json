Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a 25-year-old gay man, and his sister, who's 30, is a lesbian married to another woman. The sister wants to start a family and is asking her brother to donate sperm so that the baby would have both her and her wife's genes. The brother refuses because he wants to be a father himself, not just an uncle. He's worried about missing out on the experience of parenthood. His sister is upset, thinking he's being selfish and jealous.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, personal desires, and family dynamics. The question is whether the brother is in the wrong for saying no. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the sister is seeking help to have a child, which is a significant life goal. The brother is being asked to contribute genetically, which is a big deal. But on the other hand, the brother has his own aspirations and feelings about wanting to be a parent. He's not being asked to do something he's uncomfortable with, but he's being asked to give up a part of his future. \n\nI think it's important to consider autonomy here. The brother has the right to make his own decisions about his body and future. Even though his sister might see it as a favor, he's not obligated to comply if it goes against his personal wishes. The sister's hurt feelings are valid, but the brother's feelings and future plans are also valid.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's reaction. She accuses him of being selfish and having internal homophobia, which might be unfair. The brother is expressing his own desire to be a father, which isn't necessarily jealousy but a personal goal. The sister might need to respect his decision even if she's disappointed.\n\nAlso, the legal and emotional aspects of sperm donation should be considered. Sperm donation can have long-term implications, and the brother is right to consider his own future. If he donates now, he might lose the chance to have his own children later, especially if adoption or surrogacy is difficult in his country. That's a real concern.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the brother isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own desires. It's a tough situation, but his decision is personal. The sister's frustration is understandable, but she can't force him to donate. They need to find a compromise, but the brother's refusal isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). He's making a difficult decision based on his own future and feelings, which are valid. The sister's disappointment doesn't make his refusal wrong.\n"
