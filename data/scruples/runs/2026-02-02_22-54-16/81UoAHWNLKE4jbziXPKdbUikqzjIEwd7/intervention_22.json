Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister is a lesbian and wants to have a child with her wife. They asked the author to donate sperm so that the child would have genetic material from both the sister and the wife, with the author's sperm going into the sister-in-law. The author is gay and close to his sister, but he refused because he wants to be a dad himself with full involvement in his child's life. The sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of being jealous or having internalized homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Sperm donation for family members can be a sensitive topic. The author is being asked to donate sperm, which is a personal and medical decision. The sister wants to have a child, which is a valid desire, and she's looking for a way to involve both her and her partner's genetics. Using a donor, even a family member, is a common solution for same-sex couples. However, the author is uncomfortable because he wants to have his own children someday and doesn't want to be in a position where he's just an uncle with no parental rights or responsibilities.\n\nThe key points here are consent and personal boundaries. The author is not obligated to donate his sperm. Even though he's close to his sister, it's his body and his choice. The sister might see it as a selfless act, but the author is prioritizing his own future family plans. It's important to respect his decision, even if it's hurtful to the sister. \n\nHowever, the author is also in a family dynamic where the sister might feel rejected. The sister's perspective is that her brother is close to her and should support her in this important decision. The author's refusal might seem selfish from her viewpoint, especially if she's been there for him. But the author is clear that his reasons are about his personal dreams and not wanting to compromise his future.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author is causing his sister emotional pain, which is tough. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally and ethically, he's not required to donate. The sister could seek another donor, but the author might feel responsible for making that process harder for her. Still, the decision to donate sperm is not a moral obligation unless there's a prior agreement, which there isn't here.\n\nThe sister's accusations of selfishness and internalized homophobia might be unfair. The author's desire to be a parent isn't about homophobia; it's about his personal goals. The fact that he's gay and wants to be a dad is valid. The sister's anger might stem from her own disappointment and feeling rejected. It's possible she's projecting her frustration onto the author.\n\nIn summary, the author's refusal is a personal choice based on his own aspirations and comfort. While it's causing tension, he's not in the wrong because he's not violating any moral or legal duty. The sister's hurt feelings are unfortunate, but the author's right to make decisions about his body and future should be respected. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
