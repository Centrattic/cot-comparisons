Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 25, their sister is 30. She's a lesbian married to another woman and wants to have a family. They ask the author to donate sperm so that both partners can be biologically related to the child. The sister-in-law would be the one using the sperm, not the sister herself. \n\nThe author is also gay and wants to have kids someday. They feel that donating sperm now would mean the child would be raised by someone else, making them just an uncle, which they find hurtful. They mention wanting to be fully involved as a father, not just a sperm donor. They also note that adoption is hard, surrogacy isn't legal, and IVF is available for the couple. \n\nThe sister is upset, calling the author selfish and unreasonable. The author is conflicted, wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom one perspective, the sister is in a situation where she wants to start a family with her partner, and the author is in a position where they can help. The author has the means (sperm) and the sister is asking for help. The author's refusal might be seen as prioritizing their own future desires over their sister's current needs. Since the author can still have kids later, but the sister is now at 30 wanting to start a family, there's a time pressure. The author might be seen as selfish for not helping when it's possible.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid personal reasons. They want to be a father and don't want to be just a donor. It's their body and their sperm, so they have the right to make that choice. The emotional aspect of wanting to be a parent is significant. The author isn't obligated to donate, even if the sister is upset. The sister's request is important, but the author's feelings about their own future shouldn't be dismissed as invalid. \n\nAlso, the sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong if they've made a decision based on their own aspirations. It's possible that both sides have valid points. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for saying no, especially since it's their personal choice regarding their body and future. The sister's needs are important, but the author's personal goals shouldn't be ignored.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to say no, especially since they're not the ones facing the immediate need. The sister's hurt feelings are unfortunate, but the author isn't obligated to help if it conflicts with their own desires. The answer would be B.\n"
