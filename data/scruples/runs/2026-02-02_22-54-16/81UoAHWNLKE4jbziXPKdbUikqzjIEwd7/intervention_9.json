Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 25, their sister is 30 and her partner is also 30. They're both gay. The sister wants to start a family and asked the author to donate sperm. The author is gay and wants to be a dad themselves. They feel that donating sperm would mean they wouldn't get to experience parenthood, which is their dream. They explained their reasons, but the sister is upset, calling them selfish. The author is wondering if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's reasons. They want to have their own children, which is a valid personal goal. The sister wants to have a child with her partner, which is also a valid desire. The conflict is between these two valid goals. The author isn't refusing because of any issue with the sister's relationship or her being a lesbian; instead, it's about their own aspirations. \n\nThe sister might feel hurt because the author is a sibling who has been supportive, and she expected support in her family-building plan. The author's refusal could feel like a rejection, especially since the sister is close to them. However, the author isn't obligated to fulfill the sister's request. It's their body and their sperm, and they have the right to make decisions about their own fertility.\n\nThe sister's accusation of selfishness and internalized homophobia might be misguided. The author's reasons are based on their own future plans and emotional needs. Just because they can biologically donate sperm doesn't mean they have to. The author is prioritizing their own potential future as a parent, which is a personal choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister is in a situation where she wants to have a biological child with her partner, which is a common desire for many couples. The author might feel torn between supporting their sister and their own dreams. The sister's hurt feelings are understandable, but the author's decision is about their own life goals. \n\nIt's also important to note that the author isn't denying the sister the possibility of having a child entirely. The sister could explore other options like using a sperm donor from a bank. The author is making a personal choice that doesn't prevent the sister from pursuing other paths. \n\nIn terms of ethics, everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body and future. The author isn't forcing anyone to adopt their stance; they're simply declining a request that conflicts with their personal aspirations. The sister might need to process her feelings of rejection, but the author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their own potential parenthood. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is not in the wrong. Their decision is based on valid personal reasons, and they have the right to make choices about their own reproductive future without being labeled selfish or unreasonable.\n"
