Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. So, the key points are: the author is gay, their sister is a lesbian, they are close, the sister wants to have a family, and she's asking the author to donate sperm. The author refuses because they want to be a parent themselves, and they feel that donating sperm would mean not being a father. The sister is upset, calling them selfish and unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and personal aspects here. The author is making a personal choice based on their own desires. They have a valid reason: wanting to be a father. The sister's request is understandable, but the author's refusal is about their own future. \n\nIs it selfish? The sister might feel that the author is prioritizing their own potential family over her immediate need. But on the other hand, the author is not obligated to donate sperm. People have the right to make decisions about their bodies and reproductive choices. \n\nAlso, there's the emotional dynamic. They were close before, and now there's tension. The sister might be hurt because she expected support. But the author is being honest about their feelings. It's possible that the sister had different expectations, but the author isn't in the wrong for having different priorities.\n\nThe AITA community often focuses on whether the person did something that's generally considered wrong or hurtful without justification. Here, the author isn't doing something harmful; they're saying no. The sister's frustration is about unmet expectations, not the author acting wrongly.\n\nAnother angle: the sister is using the author's genes to have a child. The author might be uncomfortable with the idea of being genetically linked to a child they won't raise. That's a personal boundary. The author's desire to be a parent themselves is a legitimate reason. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B\u2014author is not in the wrong. They made a personal choice based on their own future and feelings, even if it caused a rift with their sister. They aren't obligated to fulfill the sister's request, especially when it conflicts with their own aspirations.\n"
