Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. I need to think through the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author is 25, his sister is 30. They're both gay, which the user mentions as \"how lucky are our parents.\" The sister wants to have a family and asked him to donate sperm so she and her partner can have a child. The sperm would go into the sister-in-law, not the sister. The author feels uncomfortable because he wants to be a dad himself, with full involvement in the child's life. He's worried about not being the father, just the uncle. He's also concerned about adoption and surrogacy not being accessible in his country. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of internalized homophobia.\n\nSo the main points here are: the author's personal desire to be a parent, the sister's desire to have a biological child with her partner, and the emotional fallout. The author explains his reasons, but the sister is taking it personally. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my take. The question is whether he is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of rights, sperm donation is a personal choice. No one can force someone to donate, even family members. The author has the right to say no, especially if it conflicts with his own dreams. However, the sister might feel let down, especially if they're close. The author's argument is that he wants to be a father, not just an uncle. That's a valid personal desire. \n\nBut the sister is using his genetic material to have a child, which might be a sensitive issue even if it's not the sister herself. The author could feel that his contribution is being used without full parental rights. There's also the emotional aspect of the sister's disappointment. \n\nAre his reasons selfish? The author is prioritizing his own future family plans. While the sister is in a position where she wants to start a family, the author's own plans are important. The key here is whether the author's refusal is unreasonable. The sister might feel she needs support from her brother, but the author has the right to his own choices. \n\nThe sister's accusations about internalized homophobia might be a stretch. The author is gay, but his desire to be a parent isn't necessarily tied to heteronormative ideas. The fact that he's accepting of his sister's situation but still has his own boundaries could be valid. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a personal choice based on his own life goals. While it's hurtful to his sister, it's not necessarily selfish or unreasonable. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
