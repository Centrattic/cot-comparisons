Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user, who is 25 and gay, is being asked by his sister, a lesbian who's married, to donate sperm so they can have a child. The sister's wife would carry the baby. The user is close to his sister and wants the best for her, but he's really uncomfortable with the idea because he wants to be a parent himself one day and doesn't want to be just an uncle. He says no, and his sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of being jealous or having internalized homophobia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The user's desire to have his own children is a personal choice. Sperm donation for family members can be a sensitive topic. On one hand, the sister is asking for help to have a child with her partner, which is a big step. On the other hand, the user is prioritizing his own future family plans. Is it wrong to put his own needs first in this case?\n\nI should think about autonomy. The user has the right to make decisions about his body and his future. Even though donating sperm might not physically harm him, emotionally, he's not ready to give up the chance to be a parent. The sister might feel hurt because she expected support, especially given their close relationship. But does that make the user wrong? It's a tough balance between personal desires and family obligations.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the sister's feelings. She's in a position where she wants to start a family and is reaching out to her brother for help. The user's refusal might feel like a rejection, which could lead to feelings of betrayal. However, the user is clear that he's not against her having kids; he just wants to be a parent himself. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"unreasonable\" here. The sister might see the request as a small sacrifice (donating sperm) for a significant benefit to them. But the user sees it as a major decision that affects his future. Is it unreasonable to prioritize one's own family plans over a sibling's? It's subjective. Some might argue that family should come first, but others would say personal autonomy is key here.\n\nThe user also mentions that he's not happy with the outcome and feels bad for making his sister cry. That shows he cares about her feelings, which is a good sign. However, he's also being honest about his own feelings. Maybe the issue here is about communication and mutual understanding rather than right or wrong. \n\nIs the user being selfish? It's a tricky term. If by doing this, he's denying his sister a way to have a biological child with her partner, but he himself hasn't had any children yet, the sister might see it as selfish. But if the user genuinely has a strong desire to be a parent and feels that this is his only option, then he's not necessarily being selfish\u2014it's his personal dream versus her's. \n\nI also need to consider cultural or societal norms. In some families, helping siblings with such matters is expected. But in others, personal choice and individual goals are more valued. The user is in a situation where he's choosing his own path. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the user is in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the family expects him to support her without considering his own needs, then he might be seen as in the wrong. However, respecting his own wishes and future is also valid. Since the question is a yes or no, I need to decide if his refusal makes him the asshole. Given that he's making a personal choice about his future and is honest about his feelings, I think he's not in the wrong. The sister's hurt feelings are real, but the user's decision is his to make. So the answer would be B.\n"
