Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, so both she and her wife can be biologically related to the child. The author, who is gay, is close to his sister and wants her to have kids, but he feels that donating sperm would prevent him from being a father himself. He's concerned about not being involved in the child's life and the possibility of never having children, especially since adoption is difficult and surrogacy isn't legal in their country.\n\nThe sister is upset, calling him selfish, while the author is conflicted. He knows he can still have children later, but he values being an active father. The question is whether his reasons are valid or if he's being unreasonable.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author has the autonomy to make decisions about his body. Sperm donation is a personal choice, and he's not obligated to donate just because his sister wants it. His reasons\u2014wanting to be a father himself\u2014are personal and valid. However, the sister is also in a situation where she's trying to build a family, which is a significant life goal.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author is in a position to help his sister achieve her dream, but at the cost of his own potential desires. However, he's not being forced to do this. It's a personal choice, and he's not wrong for prioritizing his own future family. That said, the sister might feel rejected or hurt, which is understandable. The author's explanation about wanting to be involved in a child's life is a legitimate concern. \n\nOn the flip side, the sister might argue that the author is using his own fears as an excuse. But given that he's not the one in immediate need (since he can have kids later), his refusal isn't inherently selfish. It's about personal priorities. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a choice based on his own values and desires. The sister's hurt is valid, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice his own goals.\n"
