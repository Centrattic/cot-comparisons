Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 25, their sister is 30 and her partner is also 30. The sister wants to start a family and has asked the author to donate sperm so that both she and her partner can be biologically related to the child. The author is gay and feels uncomfortable because they want to be a father themselves someday but would only be an uncle here. They said no, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish and such. The author is conflicted and wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's right to their own reproductive choices versus their sister's desire to have a family. The author explains that they want to be a parent themselves, not just a donor. They're worried about not being able to experience fatherhood. The sister is upset because she sees this as a way to have a biological child and feels rejected.\n\nI need to consider ethical, emotional, and familial aspects. The author's right to autonomy is important. No one should be forced to donate sperm, even to family. The author has their own aspirations and feelings about parenthood. However, the sister and her partner are facing challenges in having a biological child and might be in a difficult position. The author's refusal isn't about not wanting them to have kids but about their own desires. \n\nBut the sister might feel that the author should prioritize their family's needs over personal desires. However, the author isn't obligated to do so. It's a personal decision. The sister's reaction could be hurtful, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having their own boundaries. They're not denying their sister help out of spite but because of their own life goals.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they are both gay, which might add another layer of sensitivity. The sister might feel that the author doesn't understand their situation, but the author is making a choice based on their own future. It's possible that the sister is projecting her own struggles onto the author's decision.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't being selfish if they're being honest about their feelings and future plans. They\u2019re not refusing out of malice but because they want to be a parent themselves. The sister's frustration is valid, but the author's right to make this choice is also valid. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a personal choice regarding their body and future, which isn't inherently wrong.\n"
