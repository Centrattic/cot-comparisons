Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is 25, their sister is 30, and her partner is also 30. The sister wants to have a child and is asking the author to donate sperm so that the baby can have both her and her partner's genes. The author is gay and wants to be a father themselves, feeling that donating sperm now would mean the child isn't raised by them. They refused, and the sister is upset, calling them selfish. The author is conflicted, acknowledging that logically they could be more selfless but feels strongly about their own desire to be a parent.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are autonomy, personal desires, and the nature of the request. The sister is asking for a significant personal sacrifice from her brother. While they are close, the decision to have children is deeply personal. The author's reasons are based on their own life goals and emotional needs. \n\nIn many cases, people are not obligated to make personal sacrifices for family members unless there's a mutual agreement. The author isn't being asked to give up their future entirely; they can still have children later, but they feel that donating now would prevent them from experiencing fatherhood. This is a valid concern, even if others might see it as selfish. \n\nThe sister's perspective is also valid; she wants to create a family and sees this as a way to have a biological connection. However, the author's right to make their own choices about their body and future shouldn't be overlooked. The sister's accusations of selfishness might be hurtful, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own aspirations. \n\nAdditionally, the author did consider the request and tried to explain their feelings, which shows they're not being inconsiderate. The sister's reaction might be due to hurt feelings rather than the author's inherent wrongness. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a legitimate reason based on personal goals and the desire to be a parent themselves. The decision to donate sperm is a personal one, and the author isn't obligated to say yes, even if their sister is upset.\n"
