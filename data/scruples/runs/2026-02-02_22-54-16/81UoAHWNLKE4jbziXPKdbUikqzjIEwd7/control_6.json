Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her partner. The key points here are the dynamics between the siblings, the reasons for the refusal, and the sister's reaction.\n\nFirst, the background: the sister wants to have a child with her partner, and she's asking her brother to donate sperm. The brother is gay, which is an important factor. He's not comfortable with the idea because he wants to be a father himself in the future. He's worried about being just an uncle and not being involved in the child's life. The sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of jealousy or internalized homophobia.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the sister is seeking help to start a family, which is a significant life goal. She might feel that her brother, being close and available, is the ideal candidate. On the other hand, the brother has personal reasons related to his own future and emotional well-being. He wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to provide sperm without being involved in the child's life. His decision is based on his own aspirations and feelings.\n\nIs it reasonable for him to decline? Well, the decision to donate sperm is a personal one. The brother isn't obligated to do so, even if he's close to his sister. His reasons are rooted in his desire for fatherhood, which is a valid personal goal. The sister's accusation of selfishness might be a reaction to feeling rejected, but that doesn't necessarily make the brother wrong. People have the right to prioritize their own future and emotional needs.\n\nAdditionally, the sister's reaction could stem from feeling that her family isn't supporting her in a crucial life step. However, the brother isn't being selfish if his reasons are genuine and he's being honest about his feelings. The key here is whether the brother's refusal is without valid reasoning. In this case, his reasons are legitimate and relate to his own life plans.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the sister possibly misunderstanding his motivations, thinking it's about jealousy or homophobia when it's actually about his own desire to be a parent. The brother's explanation seems sincere, which adds weight to his position.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sister's wishes are important, the brother isn't in the wrong for refusing. He's making a personal choice based on his own aspirations and comfort levels, which is entirely his right. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
