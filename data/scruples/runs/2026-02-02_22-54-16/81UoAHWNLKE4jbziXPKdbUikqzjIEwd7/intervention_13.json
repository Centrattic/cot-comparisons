Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the writer refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The sister wants to have a child using the writer's sperm, but he declines because he wants to be involved in the child's life as a father and not just an uncle.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The writer is gay, so he's not interested in a relationship but wants to be a father. The sister is a lesbian married to her partner, and they want a child with both their genes. The sister asked the writer to donate sperm, which would go into her wife. The writer refuses because he wants to have his own child later, and he doesn't want to be a father in a different family setup. The sister feels hurt and thinks the writer is selfish.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The writer's reasons are personal and valid. He has a right to his own reproductive choices. He's not obligated to donate sperm, even to a close family member. The sister's request is understandable, but the writer's decision is about his own future and what he's comfortable with. The sister might feel rejected, but that doesn't make the writer wrong. \n\nAlso, the writer mentions that donating sperm would mean he's the biological father but not the social one. That's a big deal for him. Wanting to be fully involved in a child's life is a personal choice and shouldn't be judged. The sister's reaction might stem from hurt feelings, but the writer isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries around his own reproductive future.\n\nAnother angle: the writer isn't being cruel; he's being honest about his feelings. The sister could explore other options, like using a different sperm donor. The writer isn't blocking her from having a family; he's just declining because of his own priorities. \n\nSo, in the AITA framework, the answer is usually B (Not the Asshole) if someone's actions are based on personal choice and not harmful. Here, the writer is making a decision about his own body and future, which he's entitled to. The sister's disappointment is valid, but the writer's refusal isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
