Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a gay man, 25 years old. His sister is 30, a lesbian, and her partner is also 30. The sister wants to start a family and asked the author to donate sperm so that the baby would have her partner's genes and the author's. The author is uncomfortable with this because he wants to be a father himself someday. He wants to be fully involved in a child's life, not just be an uncle. He turned her down, and she's upset, calling him selfish. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the author is refusing a request from his sister to help her have a child. The sister wants to use his sperm to have a baby with her partner. The author is worried that donating would take away his chance to be a parent, even though he knows he can use his sperm later. But he's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the rights and feelings of both parties. The sister wants to build a family and sees this as a way to have a biologically related child. The author has his own aspirations to be a parent. Both are valid. The author is in a position where he's being asked to make a personal sacrifice. But is it reasonable to expect that sacrifice?\n\nOn one hand, the sister might feel that since they're family and they're close, the author should help out. On the other hand, the author is not obligated to donate sperm. He's making a personal choice based on his own future goals. The sister's request is significant, as it involves her family planning. But the author's right to make decisions about his own body is also important.\n\nThe sister might feel hurt and rejected, especially if she had high hopes. The author's refusal could be seen as selfish if he's not considering her needs. However, if the author explains his reasons and they are valid, maybe it's understandable. The key here is whether the author is being inconsiderate or if his reasons are legitimate.\n\nThe author does acknowledge that his sister is upset and feels bad about making her cry. He's also considering that he might be being unreasonable. But he has his own dreams and fears about not being able to have children later. The situation is complicated by the fact that surrogacy isn't legal in his country, and adoption is difficult. So, his options for becoming a parent might be limited, which adds to his anxiety.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to make decisions about their bodies. Donating sperm is a big commitment, not just a donation. It can have long-term implications, and the author might be worried about how it affects his future. However, if the sister is in a position where this is her only way to have a genetically related child, there's a counterargument that the author should help.\n\nBut I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a personal choice based on his own life goals. It's not that he doesn't want his sister to have kids\u2014it's about his own desires conflicting. The sister might need to seek other options or understand that the author can't fulfill her request. The author isn't obligated to sacrifice his own future for her, even if they're close. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
