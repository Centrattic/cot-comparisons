Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. The situation is pretty complex with a lot of emotions involved.\n\nFirst, the author is gay, as is his sister. They're both close, and the sister wants a child that's biologically related to both her and her partner. She approached her brother to donate sperm. The author is conflicted because he wants to be a father himself someday and doesn't want to give up that chance. He's worried about being just an uncle and not a dad. He turned her down, and now she's upset, calling him selfish. The author is doubting himself, wondering if he's being unreasonable.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, let's break it down. The sister has a legitimate desire to have a child, and she's choosing a method that would involve her partner's genes and the author's. The author is making a personal choice based on his own future family plans. But is that selfish? On one hand, he's not obligated to donate sperm. Donating is a personal decision, and he has valid reasons related to his own goals. On the other hand, he's related to the sister who's been supportive, and she might feel betrayed. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and personal choice. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by refusing. He's not causing harm, just declining a request. However, the sister's feelings are hurt, which is valid. The question is whether the author's refusal is selfish. Some might argue that he could donate now and still have options later for his own children. But others might say that his desire to be a parent is equally valid and that he's not obligated to sacrifice his future. \n\nAlso, considering the sister's perspective, she's asking for help to build a family, which is a big deal. The author's \"no\" might feel like a rejection of her dreams. But again, he has the right to prioritize his own. The sister's accusations of selfishness might not be fair if he's making a rational decision based on his own life goals. \n\nIn the end, the answer probably hinges on respecting personal boundaries. The author is not in the wrong because he's making a choice that's in his best interest, even if it's hard for the sister to accept. It's a tough situation, but his decision is his to make, and he's not obligated to meet her request if it conflicts with his own aspirations.\n"
