Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about donating sperm to his sister and her wife. The sister wants to have a baby using the author's sperm, but he refuses because he doesn't want to be an uncle without being a father. The sister is upset and thinks he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid personal reasons\u2014like wanting to be a father himself, concerns about adoption and surrogacy being hard to access, and feeling that donating sperm would mean he has to accept being an uncle without being involved in the child's life. That's a big deal for him because he has a strong desire to be a dad. It's his body and his choices about what he's comfortable with. \n\nOn the other hand, his sister is in a position where she's trying to build a family, and she had hoped for his help. The author's refusal is hurting her, and she feels rejected. It's important to note that the sister's partner is also involved here, but the main conflict is between the author and his sister. \n\nThe author isn't forcing her to have a child without his help, but he's choosing not to help. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong. Legally and ethically, people have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, even if others disagree. So, refusing to donate sperm isn't inherently wrong. However, the emotional impact and the dynamics of their relationship might be complicating things. \n\nThe sister might feel that the author is prioritizing his own desires over her family-building needs. But the author's reasons are personal and about his own future. It's a tough spot, but it's not like he's denying her other options (like using a sperm bank). He's just not willing to be involved in that specific way. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is making a choice based on his own life goals and comfort, which is his right. While it's causing pain, it doesn't make him the \"asshole\" necessarily. The sister's hurt is real, but the author isn't obligated to put his own feelings aside. So, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
