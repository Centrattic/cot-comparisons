Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is being asked by their sister to donate sperm so that the sister and her partner can have a child. The sister wants both their genes to be involved, but she's a lesbian, so she's using her partner's eggs, and the author would be the sperm donor. The author says no, and now the sister is upset, calling them selfish and unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons for saying no. They mention wanting to be a father themselves and not wanting to have a child raised by someone else. They also talk about the emotional impact of not being involved in the child's life. The sister, on the other hand, is trying to build a family and sees this as the best solution for her situation.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for refusing? Well, the author's reasons are personal and emotional. They\u2019re prioritizing their own future family plans over their sister's request. But they haven't given any ultimatums or been cruel; they just had to say no. The sister is upset, but the author did explain their feelings. \n\nThe sister might feel that because they're close, the author should help without hesitation. However, the author has valid personal boundaries. It's important in any relationship to respect each other's limits. The author isn't denying the sister the chance to have children entirely; they just can't be the donor. The sister could explore other options like sperm banks or consider other donors. \n\nBut the sister is accusing the author of being selfish and jealous. The author might feel that their own dreams are being dismissed. There's no obligation for the author to donate sperm. It's a personal decision about their own body and future. Even though the author is close to the sister, they have the right to make this choice. \n\nHowever, the author might be seen as not being supportive if they didn't offer alternative solutions. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for saying no. The key here is that the author isn't blocking the sister from having children; they're just declining a specific request. The sister's reaction is hurtful, but the author's refusal isn't inherently wrong. Everyone has different priorities, and in this case, the author is prioritizing their own family plans. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B. The author is not in the wrong for refusing based on their personal reasons and the fact that there's no legal or moral obligation to donate sperm.\n"
