Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the background: the sister is a lesbian, married to her partner. They want to have a child using the author's sperm, so the sister-in-law would be carrying. The author is gay, close to his sister, and wants to be a father himself. He's concerned about not being involved in the child's life and the emotional impact. He feels it's unfair to him because he might not have the opportunity to be a full parent. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and unreasonable. The author is torn between his feelings and his sister's needs.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The sister is using her husband's (the author's sister-in-law) eggs or using a donor? Wait, the post says the sperm would go into the sister-in-law, so the sister would be the genetic parent, and the sister-in-law would carry. So the couple wants their baby to have both their genes, which might mean one is providing the egg and the other the sperm. The author is being asked to donate sperm so that the sister-in-law can carry, making the sister the biological parent with the author's sperm. The author is not being asked to be a parent, just a donor.\n\nNow, the author's reasons are about his own desire to be a father. He's worried that if he donates, he'll miss out on being a parent and feels that his sister is being denied. But the sister is using her husband's (sister-in-law's) body to carry. So the author is not the second parent, just a sperm donor. The sister is already a parent through her own genes, and the sister-in-law would be carrying. The author is refusing because he wants to use his own sperm in the future. \n\nIs this selfish? Well, each person has their own priorities. The author's desire to be a parent is valid. The sister is in a position to have a child through IVF, but the author is the only option for the biological father. If he donates, he's giving up that chance for himself. The sister might feel hurt because she expects support from her brother, especially since they're close. But the author isn't obligated to donate. The sister-in-law is the one carrying, so the author isn't the one being asked to be the carrier. The author's feelings about wanting to be an active parent are important. Also, the sister is using her own genes, so the author isn't the only way to have a biological child. Wait, the sister is a lesbian, so she might not have a child with her own genes unless they use a donor or IVF. If IVF is legal for lesbian couples, maybe they could use a donor without the author. But perhaps in their situation, they prefer using him. The author is not in the wrong if he's honest about his own desires. The sister's reaction might be harsh, but the author's choice is personal. The key here is the author's right to make decisions about his own body and future. It's not that he's denying them the child he's denying himself. So, answer B (No).\n"
