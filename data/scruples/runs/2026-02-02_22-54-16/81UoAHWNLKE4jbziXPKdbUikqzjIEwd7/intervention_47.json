Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The author is gay and 25, the sister is 30 and married to another woman. The sister wants to have a child using the author's sperm, which would go into her wife. The author explains that he wants to be a father himself and doesn't want to just be an uncle. He's conflicted and feels his reasons are valid, but his sister is upset, calling him selfish and accusing him of being jealous or having internalized homophobia.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. He's making a personal choice about his body and future family plans. The sister is asking for a significant commitment\u2014sperm donation isn't just a one-time thing; it has lifelong implications. The author wants to be actively involved in his child's life, which is a valid desire. He's not denying the sister the chance to have kids entirely; he's just declining to be the genetic parent. The sister could explore other options like donor sperm or adoption, though she might prefer using a family member's sperm.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister feels hurt and rejected. The author is close to her, and this request is a big deal for her, so the refusal is hurtful. However, the author isn't obligated to give his sperm. It's his body, and he has the right to set boundaries. The sister's accusations of selfishness might be valid from her perspective, but the author's reasons are about his own life goals. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's aware he could still have children later, so it's not a medical necessity for him. The sister's needs are valid, but so are the author's. The key here is autonomy. The author isn't being selfish in the sense of not caring; he's weighing his own future against her request. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a personal choice that's important to him, even if it upsets his sister. The sister's disappointment is real, but the author isn't obligated to help. The answer should be B (No).\n"
