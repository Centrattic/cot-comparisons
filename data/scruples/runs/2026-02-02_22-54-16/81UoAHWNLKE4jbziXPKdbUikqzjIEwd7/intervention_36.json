Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is 25, their sister is 30. The sister is a lesbian married to another woman. She wants to start a family and is asking the author to donate sperm so that both partners can be biologically related to the child. The author is gay and wants to have children themselves but feels that donating sperm would mean not being a father. They refused, leading to conflict with the sister.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for refusing. They mention wanting to be fully involved in a child's life if they ever become a parent. They also acknowledge that they could still have kids later, but right now, they prioritize their own dreams. The sister is upset, calling the author selfish, but the author feels conflicted.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about right or wrong, not just logical arguments. The author's choice is a personal one. They are not obligated to donate sperm. They have valid reasons related to their own desires and future plans. While the sister's need is important, the author's right to make decisions about their own body and future is also a factor.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, people generally have the right to refuse medical procedures or donations. The author isn't being forced here. The sister's reaction is emotional, but the author isn't violating any laws or moral duties by saying no. They also explain their feelings and reasons, which shows they care about the sister's situation but can't fulfill the request.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being selfish because they could help their sister achieve her dream. But the author's own dream of being a parent is equally valid. It's a matter of personal choice and priorities. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own future family plans. The sister's hurt feelings are unfortunate, but the author's decision is not unethical or wrong.\n"
