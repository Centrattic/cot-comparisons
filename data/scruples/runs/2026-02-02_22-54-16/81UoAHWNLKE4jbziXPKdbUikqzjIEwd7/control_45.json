Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and her wife. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the background: The author is 25, their sister is 30 and married to another woman. The sister wants to have a family and is asking the author to donate sperm so that both she and her wife can be biologically related to the child. The author is gay and wants to be a father themselves but doesn't want to donate sperm for their sister because they want to be fully involved in a child's life. They feel that donating would make them just an uncle, not a father. The sister is upset, calls them selfish, and accuses them of being jealous or having internalized homophobia.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). Let's analyze both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They have valid reasons tied to their personal goals and feelings. They want to be a father, not just a donor. The process of having kids is challenging for them due to adoption and surrogacy not being feasible. Their decision is based on wanting to be a parent, which is a legitimate desire. It's their body, and they have the right to make decisions about their own reproductive choices.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective: She's seeking help to build a family, which is a significant life goal. She might feel hurt and rejected because her sibling, who she's close to, is not supporting her. The author's refusal could be seen as selfish if the sister feels the author is prioritizing their own future over helping her. However, the sister's accusations of internalized homophobia might be unfounded if the author's reasons are genuine.\n\nLegally and ethically, individuals have the right to refuse medical procedures or donations, even if others are disappointed. The author isn't obligated to donate sperm. However, relationships can be strained when someone says no, especially in families. The sister's reactions are hurtful, but the author's reasons are personal and valid.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author is in a close relationship with their sister and feels guilty causing her pain. The sister's anger and accusations might be more about her own hurt than the author's actions being objectively wrong. The author's decision is personal and not about the sister's needs, which is their right.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's refusal is based on their personal desires and life plans. While it's hurtful to the sister, it's not inherently selfish if they're not making a profit or avoiding a legal obligation. They are choosing their future as a parent, which is their own choice. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
