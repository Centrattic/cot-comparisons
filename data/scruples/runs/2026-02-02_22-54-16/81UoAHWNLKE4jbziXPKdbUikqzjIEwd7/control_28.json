Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to his sister and her wife. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe author is 25, his sister is 30, and her wife is also 30. They're all close, and the sister wants to have a family. She asked him to donate sperm so that their baby would have both their genes. The author is uncomfortable because he wants to be a dad himself, and he's worried that if he donates sperm, he'll just be an uncle. He mentioned that adoption and surrogacy are difficult in his country, so he's concerned about his own chances of having kids. His sister is upset, calling him selfish and unreasonable, and he's wondering if he's being an asshole.\n\nFirst, let's consider the sister's request. She wants to have children with her wife and is looking for a way to include both their genes. Using the author's sperm would make the child biologically related to her, which is a valid desire. However, the author is not the child's father in the traditional sense; he's donating sperm, which is a common practice in such situations. The sister might feel that since the author is also gay, he might understand their need for a family, but that's not necessarily a given. \n\nNow, the author's reasoning: He wants to be a father and doesn't want to be just an uncle. He's concerned that donating sperm might limit his future options, even though he knows he can still have kids later. But he's also worried about the emotional aspect of fathering a child he won't raise. That's a big deal. Fatherhood is a significant responsibility and emotional commitment, and if he's not ready to take on that role, even as a donor, then it's his choice. \n\nThe sister is upset, feeling rejected and thinking the author is being selfish. But is it fair to demand a family member to donate sperm, especially when it's a personal decision with long-term implications? The author isn't denying her the possibility of having a child entirely; he's just not willing to be the donor. There are other options like using a sperm bank. The sister might feel close to the author, but that doesn't mean he can't have his own boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that he had internal issues with accepting his sexuality because of wanting to have kids, which complicates his feelings. It's important to validate his feelings about wanting to be an active parent. While it's generous to help family, his own aspirations and emotional well-being are crucial. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might be in a vulnerable position, trying to build a family and feeling disappointed. But that doesn't mean the author is obligated to say yes. The key here is consent and personal choice. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his own future fatherhood and not wanting to be a donor if he's not prepared for that role. \n\nSo, the answer probably isn't straightforward. It's a matter of personal boundaries versus family support. But since the author is being honest about his feelings and the sister is using emotional pressure, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a self-centered decision, but it's about his own life goals. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
