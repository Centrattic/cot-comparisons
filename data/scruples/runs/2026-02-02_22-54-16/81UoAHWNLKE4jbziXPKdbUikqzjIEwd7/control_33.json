Obviously, my sister is a lesbian. I am also gay (how lucky are our parents haha) We are extremely close, always have been, she's always been there for me and want the best for her. So my sister got married to her partner last year. I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. \n\nIt's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. \n\nSo, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..\n\nAm I just being an unreasonable asshole here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to donate sperm to their sister and sister-in-law. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 25-year-old gay man, and his sister is a 30-year-old lesbian. The sister wants to start a family using the author's sperm, which would be implanted into her partner. The sister assumes he'll say yes, but he's uncomfortable because he wants to be a father himself. He explains his reasons: he wants to experience fatherhood fully, not just be the biological provider. He's worried about not being able to have kids later, especially since adoption and surrogacy are difficult in his country. His sister is upset, calling him selfish, and he's questioning if he's being unreasonable.\n\nNow, the key points here are his motivations and the ethical implications. The author is making a personal choice about his own body and future. The sister's request is valid, given their situation, but the author's reasons for declining are personal. The question is whether he's in the wrong for saying no.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies. Even if donating sperm could help his sister, the author isn't obligated to do so. His reasons\u2014wanting to be a father, concerns about the future\u2014seem legitimate. He's not denying her the chance to have a child; he's just choosing not to be the donor. \n\nThe sister's upset is understandable, especially if she felt close and thought he'd support her. But does that make him wrong? Maybe not. The author isn't being selfish if he's prioritizing his own desires, which are valid. However, the way he presented his refusal might have hurt her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's need for a family and the emotional impact of being rejected could be significant. But again, the author isn't wrong for having his own boundaries. It's a personal choice. The answer would hinge on whether personal autonomy outweighs the sister's wishes here.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often feel guilty for not meeting others' expectations, especially family. But in this case, the author isn't violating any rules or laws. His reasons are personal and not malicious. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). However, the emotional aspect might make some argue A, but from a rights-based perspective, it's B.\n"
